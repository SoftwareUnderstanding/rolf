Will it be possible to break collective thought patterns through targeted, non-human stimuli and create a new level of creativity in the interaction between humans and artificial intelligence? How can we make use of the significant advances in the field of AI in recent years to build the creative process of the future in an enriching way?  \nThe possibility of mathematically representing complex systems such as language or painting styles enables a completely new approach to a variety of topics. Connections in large amounts of data can be detected and rules can be extracted from them. Based on these rules, data can be combined with each other, resulting in outcomes that exceed what is humanly possible.  \nOn this basis, the creative process was analyzed and compared with the possibilities of AI. The goal is to generate impulses from the linking of various data and to show new perspectives on existing problems, which inspire people to find new solutions: Artificial Inspiration. \nFor this purpose, a theoretical process for increasing creativity with the help of AI was developed, which essentially consists of two steps:  \n",

      "excerpt": "1. SinGAN (Shaham et al., 2019) was used to make broad changes to the structure of the initial image to increase the variance of the results. It was implemented using a notebook by Derrick Schultz (Notebook: Schultz, 2019).  \n1. StyleGAN network blending, which was introduced by Justin Pinkney (Pinkney, 2020), is used to blend two StyleGAN models. To be specific, a StyleGAN2 model trained only on the initial image, and therefore able to replicate it, was merged with a second network trained on the MetFaces dataset (data: Karras et al., 2020). This produces images of the initial portrait, with variations in the angle and shape of the head. In addition, the resulting images are reminding of paintings. A notebook by Justin Pinkney was used for the implementation (Notebook: Pinkney, 2020) \n1. In transfer learning, the data set on which StyleGAN trains was exchanged during the training process. A notebook by Derrick Schultz was used for this purpose (Notebook: Schultz, 2020). First, the network was trained on a dataset of logos (Data: Sage et al., 2017). Then, this dataset was replaced with only the initial image. This results in interesting and very abstract portrait representations. \n1. The style transfer transfers the style of one image to the content of another image, in this case the initial portrait. A number of parameters such as the selection of the style image from the dataset, hue, saturation, cropping of the style image, intensity of the style to be transferred, and the number of images giving the style were randomized, which is intended to create as much variance as possible. For implementation, a notebook by Derrick Schultz was adapted for this particular use (original notebook: Schultz, 2019). Three datasets consisting of paintings were chosen as the style images. These are paintings of all types. (Data: Bryan, 2020; Data: Kaggle, 2016; Data: Surma, 2019). You can find the modified version of the notebook used in this project here. \n1. Deep Dream visualizes what a trained image recognition neural network sees in an image. Here, the \"Inception v1\" model (Szegedy et al., 2014). For implementation, a notebook was adapted for this purpose. The original notebook is from Derrick Schultz with code from Alexander Mordvintsev (Notebook: Schultz). You can find the modified version of the notebook used in this project here. \n1. All images were generated or manipulated in a resolution of 256x256 pixels, since this is considerably faster and saves computing power. However, since a higher resolution is desired for the result, the images are finally run through a \"Super-Resolution\" algorithm, whereby the image size is increased to 1024x1024. For this, \"Image Super Resolution\" was used (Francesco Cardinale et al., 2018). \n",

Replace the folder \"artificial-inspiration/Unity VR Dataset Explorer/Assets/Resources/images/\" with your generated image folder or the one you downloaded. Important: The folder MUST be named \"images\" and the CSV file \"img2vec.cvs\"\n1. Open the folder \"artificial-inspiration/Unity VR Dataset Explorer\" with Unity 2019.4.15f1 and open the scene \"vrDataExplorer\". When Unity asks you if you want to enable the backends because of the new input system, click no! \n1. If you want to access your selected images online later, upload the content in the folder \"artificial-inspiration/selected images web app\" to a server. Then add the link to the file \"artificial-inspiration/selected images web app/images/uploadImages.php\" in Unity under \"Images Upload URL\" in the script \"Upload Images\".\n1. If you don't use VR, activate \"Start in Explore Mode\" in the \"Constructor\" script. You can view the images and apply filters in the editor. Most of the functions are unfortunately not available.\n1. If you use VR, you can use all the features. You can find them all in Unity and use most of them during the VR experience to explore your dataset and find the most exciting images. \n1.
