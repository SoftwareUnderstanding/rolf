The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the        runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of    graphics processing units (GPUs) during training \n",

The original purpose of VGG's research on the depth of convolutional networks is to understand how the     depth of convolutional networks affects the accuracy and accuracy of large-scale image classification and recognition. -Deep-16 CNN), in order to deepen the number of network layers and to avoid too           many parameters, a small 3x3 convolution kernel is used in all layers. \n",
