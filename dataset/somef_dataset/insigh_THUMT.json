It implements the standard attention-based model (RNNsearch) (Bahdanau et al., 2014), minimum risk training (MRT) (Shen et al., 2016) for optimizing model parameters with respect to evaluation metrics, semi-supervised training (SST) (Cheng et al., 2016) for exploiting monolingual corpora to learn bi-directional translation models, and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) (Ding et al., 2017) for visualizing and anlayzing RNNsearch. \nThe following table summarizes the features of two implementations: \n| Implementation | Model | Criterion | Optimizer | LRP | \n",
