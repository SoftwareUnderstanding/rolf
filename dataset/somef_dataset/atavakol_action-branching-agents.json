      "excerpt": "Discrete-action algorithms have been central to numerous recent successes of deep reinforcement learning. However, applying these algorithms to high-dimensional action tasks requires tackling the combinatorial increase of the number of possible actions with the number of action dimensions. This problem is further exacerbated for continuous-action tasks that require fine control of actions via discretization. To address this problem, we propose the action branching architecture, a novel neural architecture featuring a shared network module followed by several network branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. \n",

      "excerpt": "Branching Dueling Q-Network (BDQ) is a novel agent which is based on the incorporation of the proposed action branching architecture into the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, as well as adapting a selection of its extensions, Double Q-Learning, Dueling Network Architectures, and Prioritized Experience Replay.  \nAs we show in the paper, BDQ is able to solve numerous continuous control domains via discretization of the action space. Most remarkably, we have shown that BDQ is able to perform well on the Humanoid-v1 domain with a total of 6.5 x 10<sup>25</sup> discrete actions.      \n",
