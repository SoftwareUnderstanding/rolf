      "excerpt": "SSD is an unified framework for object detection with a single network. You can use the code to train/evaluate a network for object detection task. For more details, please refer to [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).\n\nThis repository contains a TensorFlow re-implementation of the original [Caffe code](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd). At present, it only implements VGG-based SSD networks (with 300 and 512 inputs), but the architecture of the project is modular, and should make easy the implementation and training of other SSD variants (ResNet or Inception based for instance). Present TF checkpoints have been directly converted from SSD Caffe models.\n\nThe organisation is inspired by the [TF-Slim models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/inception/inception/slim/README.md) repository containing the implementation of popular architectures (ResNet, Inception and VGG).\n\n",

Shortly, the detection is made of two main steps: running the SSD network on the image and post-processing the output using common algorithms.\n\nTo run the [SSD image detection](./ssd_image_detection.py) you first have to unzip the checkpoint files in ./checkpoint:\n\n```\nunzip ssd_300_vgg.ckpt.zip\n```\n\nNow run this:\n\n```\npython ssd_image_detection.py\n```\n",
