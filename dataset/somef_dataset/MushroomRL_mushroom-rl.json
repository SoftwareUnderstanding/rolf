    "excerpt": "Contributing to MushroomRL\nWe strongly encourage researchers to provide us feedback and contributing\nto MushroomRL. You can contribute in the following ways:\n* providing bug reports;\n* implementing new algorithms, approximators, environments, and so on;\n* proposing improvements to the library, or documentation.\nHow to report bugs\nPlease use GitHub Issues and use the \"bug\" tag to label it. It is desirable if you can provide a minimal Python script\nwhere the bug occurs. If the bug is confirmed, you can also provide a pull request to fix it, or wait for the maintainers to\nresolve the issue.\nExtending MushroomRL\nAlthough any contribution is welcome, we will only accept high-quality code that will reflect the key ideas\nof modularity and flexibility of MushroomRL. Please keep this in mind before submitting\na pull request.\nAlgorithms\nEvery algorithm in MushroomRL must extend the Agent interface. If the algorithm belongs to a class of algorithms already\nimplemented in MushroomRL, then we expect the author to extend the appropriate interface. If new policies or new parameter types\nare needed, please extend the corresponding base classes. Using other MushroomRL modules (e.g. Regressor, Features) is\nhighly encouraged. Together with the algorithm, you must provide an example and a test case. Every algorithm matching our\nstandard of code and scientific quality and providing the example and the test, will be merged in MushroomRL. It is encouraged\nto include the citation to the paper describing the algorithm in the docstring of the class.\nFunction approximators\nMushroomRL supports the use of third-party function approximators (e.g. Scikit-learn, Keras),\nor customized ones, given that they implement the fit and predict methods.\nEnvironments\nThe environment template of MushroomRL follows the style of the one introduced in OpenAI Gym.\nCustomized environment can be added provided that this exact style is used, and extending\nthe Environment interface. Customized functions for visualization, i.e., render, and\nothers can be easily added.\nExamples\nMushroomRL provides several examples showing the expected instructions sequence that an\nexperiment should have. This structure is not mandatory, but recommended. Although all\nthe examples share some similarities, there are some differences depending on the\nalgorithm and environments at hand, and also on the specific needs of the user. It is\ndesirable to propose an example whenever a new algorithm or environment is proposed in\na pull request. The choice of the type of experiment is up to the contributor, but it should\nbe meaningful to show the performance and properties of the proposed algorithm/environment.\nBenchmarks\nInstructions for adding a new benchmark are provided in the MushroomRL Benchmarking Suite.\nProposing improvements\nIf you find some lack of features, please open a GitHub issue and use the \"enhancement\" tag to label it. However, before\nopening a pull request, we suggest to discuss it with the maintainers of the library, that will be glad of providing\nsuggestions and help in case the proposed improvement is particularly interesting.",
