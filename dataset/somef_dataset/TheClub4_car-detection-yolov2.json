      "excerpt": "Input image (608, 608, 3)\n\nThe input image goes through a CNN, resulting in a (19, 19, 5, 85) dimensional output.\n\nAfter flattening the last two dimensions, the output is a volume of shape (19, 19, 425). Each cell in a 19 x 19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers: 425 = 5 x 85 because each cell contains predictions for 5 boxes, corresponding to 5 anchor boxes; 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because (pc, bx, by, bh, bw) has 5 numbers, and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect.\n\nWe then select only a few boxes based on score-thresholding--discarding boxes that have detected a class with a score less than the threshold, and non-max suppression\u200a-\u200acomputing the Intersection over Union (IOU) and avoiding selecting overlapping boxes.\n\nThis gives the YOLO's final output.\n\n",
