Human visual system is rather dynamic and recurrsive, therefore, interactive through out different layers. \nSuch a top-down and bottom-up interactions are seemed to mimicked as a form of residual layers (or short and long skip connections). However, it is unclear how it is explained with regard to human visual processing.  \nIn current project, characteristics of mutiple scale residual maps are studied, and their integration strategies are studied. Corresponding features and integration strategies are considered with respect to human perceptual features.  \nThis was supported by Deep Learning Camp Jeju 2018 which was organized by TensorFlow Korea User Group and supported by tensorflow Korea, Google, Kakao-brain, Netmarble, SKT, Element AI, JDC, and Jeju Univ. \n",
