      "excerpt": "In this MSci project we are looking at the structure of human-human conversation under 2 different lenses: as a macroscopic trajectory through a topic space (built from the components of word embeddings) and as a string of microscopic dialogue acts. From the topic space analysis we hope to build a signature graphical representation of the transcript which visualises the evolution of topics discussed, and portrays key information about the given conversation. From the dialogue analysis we hope to answer the question 'What makes Conversation Interesting?'. \n",

We introduce Discussion Trees: graphics designed to offer a birds-eye-view of conversation transcripts in a way which aims to uncover high-level trends in human communication patterns.  \nAs output graphics from two podcast transcripts are structured according to the same set of rules, they can be directly visually compared and in doing so highlight differences in conversation structure and topical evolution. When applied to podcast transcripts, we propose Discussion Tree as a method of podcast hosts gaining insight into their unique interview styles, as a way to evaluate why one episode found more success than another, and also as means of transcript data navigation. Discussion Trees for the interviews of a) Jack Dorsey and b) Elon Musk by Joe Rogan on the Joe Rogan podcast.  \n",
