      "excerpt": "mage-to-image translation is the task of transforming an image from one domain (e.g., images of zebras), to another (e.g., images of horses). Ideally, other features of the image \u2014 anything not directly related to either domain, such as the background \u2014 should stay recognizably the same. As we might imagine, a good image-to-image translation system could have an almost unlimited number of applications. Changing art styles, going from sketch to photo, or changing the season of the landscape in a photo are just a few examples. \n",
