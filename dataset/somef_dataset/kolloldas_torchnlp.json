It can support any dataset which uses the CoNLL 2003 format. More tasks will be added shortly \n",

      "excerpt": "TorchNLP is designed to be used inside the python interpreter to make it easier to experiment without typing cumbersome command line arguments. \n\n**NER Task**\n\nThe NER task can be run on any dataset that confirms to the [CoNLL 2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) format. To use the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset place the dataset files in the following directory structure within your workspace root:\n```\n.data\n  |\n  |---conll2003\n          |\n          |---eng.train.txt\n          |---eng.testa.txt\n          |---eng.testb.txt\n```\n`eng.testa.txt` is used the validation dataset and `eng.testb.txt` is used as the test dataset.\n\nStart the NER module in the python shell which sets up the imports:\n```\npython -i -m torchnlp.ner\n```\n```\nTask: Named Entity Recognition\n\nAvailable models:\n-------------------\nTransformerTagger\n\n    Sequence tagger using the Transformer network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)\n    Specifically it uses the Encoder module. For character embeddings (per word) it uses\n    the same Encoder module above which an additive (Bahdanau) self-attention layer is added\n\nBiLSTMTagger\n\n    Sequence tagger using bidirectional LSTM. For character embeddings per word\n    uses (unidirectional) LSTM\n\n\nAvailable datasets:\n-------------------\n    conll2003: Conll 2003 (Parser only. You must place the files)\n\n>>>\n```\n\nTrain the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model on the CoNLL 2003 dataset:\n```\n>>> train('ner-conll2003', TransformerTagger, conll2003)\n```\nThe first argument is the task name. You need to use the same task name during evaluation and inference. By default the train function will use the F1 metric with a window of 5 epochs to perform early stopping. To change the early stopping criteria set the `PREFS` global variable as follows:\n```\n>>> PREFS.early_stopping='lowest_3_loss'\n```\nThis will now use validation loss as the stopping criteria with a window of 3 epochs. The model files are saved under *taskname-modelname* directory. In this case it is *ner-conll2003-TransformerTagger*\n\nEvaluate the trained model on the *testb* dataset split:\n```\n>>> evaluate('ner-conll2003', TransformerTagger, conll2003, 'test')\n```\nIt will display metrics like accuracy, sequence accuracy, F1 etc\n\nRun the trained model interactively for the ner task:\n```\n>>> interactive('ner-conll2003', TransformerTagger)\n...\nCtrl+C to quit\n> Tom went to New York\nI-PER O O I-LOC I-LOC\n```\nYou can similarly train the bidirectional LSTM CRF model by using the `BiLSTMTagger` class.\nCustomizing hyperparameters is quite straight forward. Let's look at the hyperparameters for `TransformerTagger`:\n```\n>>> h2 = hparams_transformer_ner()\n>>> h2\n\nHyperparameters:\n filter_size=128\n optimizer_adam_beta2=0.98\n learning_rate=0.2\n learning_rate_warmup_steps=500\n input_dropout=0.2\n embedding_size_char=16\n dropout=0.2\n hidden_size=128\n optimizer_adam_beta1=0.9\n embedding_size_word=300\n max_length=256\n attention_dropout=0.2\n relu_dropout=0.2\n batch_size=100\n num_hidden_layers=1\n attention_value_channels=0\n attention_key_channels=0\n use_crf=True\n embedding_size_tags=100\n learning_rate_decay=noam_step\n embedding_size_char_per_word=100\n num_heads=4\n filter_size_char=64\n ```\n Now let's disable the CRF layer:\n ```\n >>> h2.update(use_crf=False)\n\nHyperparameters:\n filter_size=128\n optimizer_adam_beta2=0.98\n learning_rate=0.2\n learning_rate_warmup_steps=500\n input_dropout=0.2\n embedding_size_char=16\n dropout=0.2\n hidden_size=128\n optimizer_adam_beta1=0.9\n embedding_size_word=300\n max_length=256\n attention_dropout=0.2\n relu_dropout=0.2\n batch_size=100\n num_hidden_layers=1\n attention_value_channels=0\n attention_key_channels=0\n use_crf=False\n embedding_size_tags=100\n learning_rate_decay=noam_step\n embedding_size_char_per_word=100\n num_heads=4\n filter_size_char=64\n ```\n Use it to re-train the model:\n ```\n >>> train('ner-conll2003-nocrf', TransformerTagger, conll2003, hparams=h2)\n ```\n Along with the model the hyperparameters are also saved so there is no need to pass the `HParams` object during evaluation. Also note that by default it will not overwrite any existing model directories (will rename instead). To change that behavior set the PREFS variable:\n ```\n >>> PREFS.overwrite_model_dir = True\n ```\n The `PREFS` variable is automatically persisted in `prefs.json`\n \n **Chunking Task**\n \n The [CoNLL 2000](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/) dataset is available for the Chunking task. The dataset is automatically downloaded from the public repository so you don't need to manually download it.\n\nStart the Chunking task:\n```\npython -i -m torchnlp.chunk\n```\nTrain the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model:\n```\n>>> train('chunk-conll2000', TransformerTagger, conll2000)\n```\nThere is no validation partition provided in the repository hence 10% of the training set is used for validation.\n\nEvaluate the model on the test set:\n```\n>>> evaluate('chunk-conll2000', TransformerTagger, conll2000, 'test')\n```\n\n ",
