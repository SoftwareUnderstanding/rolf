For further details please read our paper on the subject: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02852 or visit our blog Solving Atari games with Distributed Reinforcement Learning. \nIt's a distributed version of the A3C algorithm in Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning. \nWe based our implementation on Tensorpack version of A3C. \nIt's prepared to run on large CPU clusters with Slurm manager (it was tested on up to 1500 cores) \nIn our experiments we've used Tensorflow with MKL. Our code should work with usual TensorFlow 1.2, but we neither tested nor have any benchmarks for it. \n",
