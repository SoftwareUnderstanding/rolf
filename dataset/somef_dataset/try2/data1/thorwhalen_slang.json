      "excerpt": "In contrast with the standard paradigms of machine learning, \nthe less common \u200bstructured learning approach attempts to use structural information of both the classified objects and \nthe classification domain. An even lesser known research area takes this idea a step further by articulating \nthe structural aspect as a formal grammar that defines rules that derive signal constructs to classification constructs.\nWe propose an approach where both sound and its semantics are expressed in a manner that enables the detection system \nto take advantage of the structural aspects of both.\nThe importance of a structural framework is further supported as we attempt to go beyond detecting isolated \n\u200bsound occurrence\u200b toward interpreting sequences of these occurrences and discovering \u200bsound generating activities\u200b. \nThese sound generating activities can be expressed through ontologies \nand sequential rules composed from other semantical elements.\n \n\nThis approach has been coined as \u201csyntactical pattern recognition\u201d or \u201cgrammar induction\u201d. These techniques have been \nused in Chinese character recognition [\u200b4\u200b], analysis of textures [\u200b10\u200b], medical diagnosis (heart disease detection) [\u200b16\u200b],\n visual scene recognition [\u200b22\u200b], movement recognition in video [\u200b19\u200b], activity monitoring in video [\u200b19\u200b], \n and closer to sound (since uni-dimensional time-series), seismic signal analysis (eg. in oil detection) [\u200b8\u200b] \n and ECG analysis [\u200b18\u200b, \u200b16\u200b].\nAs far as we know, no research has been carried out to apply syntactical pattern recognition techniques \nto general sound recognition, and we intend to take inspiration in this literature in an effort to derive semantics \nfrom sound.\n\n",
