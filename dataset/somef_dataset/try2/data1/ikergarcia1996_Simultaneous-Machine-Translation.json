      "excerpt": "This is a project made by Iker Garc\u00eda for the Advanced applications on language technologies course. This course is taught in the master of natural language processing in the EHU/UPV. \nIn the educational world there exists a big problem, the problem of different languages. For example, our university offers courses in Basque to those who do not know the language can not attend. There are also courses in Spanish that people who come from other countries (Erasmus) can not attend. And these are just some examples, the language barrier is a big problem in the educational world. That\u2019s why my project focuses in trying to solve this problem. My idea is to implement a simultaneous translator that can automatically translate on the go a conversation from one language to another. The application will be able to listen to someone speaking and it will display as text what he has said translated to another language \nThe simultaneous translation is composed of two modules, the \u201cspeech to text\u201d module and the \u201ctranslation\u201d module. \n",
