Please refer to [https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html#amp-examples](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html#amp-examples).\r\n\r\n**Add support for distributed training**\r\nPlease refer to for more details [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).\r\n\r\n**Automated data enhancement**\r\nPlease refer to for more details [https://github.com/kakaobrain/fast-autoaugment](https://github.com/kakaobrain/fast-autoaugment).\r\n\r\n**Add test model performance function**\r\nWe used the Thop tool to calculate the complexity of the entire model and the inference time. More details see [https://github.com/Lornatang/ESRGAN-PyTorch#test-model-performance](https://github.com/Lornatang/ESRGAN-PyTorch#test-model-performance)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- The definition of content loss is wrong. It should be `nn.L1Loss` instead of `nn.MSELoss`.\r\n- Error in changing the definition of perceived loss.\r\n- Fixed the problem of unable to read the video stream while inferring the video.",
