I also referenced rlkit's SAC pytorch implementation, especially for the policy and value models part, but did a lot of simplification. \n\nConsult Spinup documentation for output and plotting:\n\nhttps://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/saving_and_loading.html\n\nhttps://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/plotting.html\n\n\n",
