      "excerpt": "This repository contains the source code to support the paper: Self-Supervised Generalisation with Meta Auxiliary Learning, introduced by Shikun Liu, Andrew J. Davison and Edward Johns. \nSee project page here. \nNov 2021: We have implemented the first order approximation of MAXL framework, which would speed up 4 - 6 times training time compared to the original implementation. The first order approximation is based on the finite difference method, inspired by DARTS. No more tedious forward functions for the inner loop optimisation now. Enjoy. :) \nThis repository includes three models model_vgg_single.py, model_vgg_human.py and model_vgg_maxl.py representing baselines Single, Human and our proposed algorithm MAXL with backbone architecture VGG-16. These three models are trained with 4-level CIFAR-100 dataset which should easily reproduce part of the results in Figure 3. \nIn create_dataset.py, we define an extended version of CIFAR-100 with 4-level hierarchy built on the original CIFAR100 class in torchvision.datasets (see the full table for semantic classes in Appendix A). To fetch one batch of input data with kth hierarchical labels as defined below, we have train_data which represents the input images and train_label which represents the 4-level hierarchical labels: train_label[:, k], k = 0, 1, 2, 3 fetches 3, 10, 20 and 100-classes respectively. \n",
