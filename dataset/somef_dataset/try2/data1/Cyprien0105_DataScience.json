So if you want to apply the model on 3 classes, you have to create 3 folders, sort your images by classes and store each class in one folder. Give the same name to the folder as the class it contains.\n\n\nHere an example of dataset used in the example folder : https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~mbappy/pubs/README.pdf\n\nIt contains real estates images divided in six classes."
