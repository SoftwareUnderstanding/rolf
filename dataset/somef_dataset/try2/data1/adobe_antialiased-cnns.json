Before, I was training from scratch. The results are better.\n* **(Oct 2020) Additional models** We now have 23 total model variants. I added variants of vgg, densenet, resnext, wide resnet varieties! The same conclusions hold.\n* **(Sept 2020) Pip install** You can also now `pip install antialiased-cnns` and load models with the `pretrained=True` flag.\n* **(Sept 2020) Kernel 4** I have added kernel size 4 experiments. When downsampling an even sized feature map (e.g., a 128x128-->64x64), this is actually the correct size to use to keep the indices from drifting.\n\n",

BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\\n\\nd. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\\n\\n   6.
