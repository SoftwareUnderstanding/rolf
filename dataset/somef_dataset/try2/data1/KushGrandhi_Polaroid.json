Due to the Online class culture, taking notes in pen and paper is not a good idea, the only options left are to click screenshots or struggle to note down everything in your notebook:unamused:. Our application will make your life easier, once a meeting video:film_projector: is provided, we will create the notes that will save you time:stopwatch: of research and gathering resources. We will divide your meeting into useful segments and add additional data to make it easy to understand any concept.:bookmark_tabs::bookmark_tabs:*\n\n",

Not being able to keep up the pace:hourglass_flowing_sand::hourglass_flowing_sand: due to concise information on each slide.**\n\n**2. Not having the ability to write:black_nib::black_nib: effectively what the teacher explains.**\n\n*We plan to address these issues through our project:innocent::wink:.*\n\n---\n\n**Named Entity Recognition system** *features a sophisticated word embedding strategy using subword features and \"Bloom\" embeddings, a deep convolutional neural network with residual connections, and a novel transition-based approach to named entity parsing. The system is designed to give a good balance of efficiency, accuracy and adaptability.*\n\nSource: https://spacy.io/universe/project/video-spacys-ner-model\n\n**BART** *is a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. It is trained by corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Transformer-based neural machine translation architecture. It uses a standard seq2seq/NMT architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT). This means the encoder's attention mask is fully visible, like BERT, and the decoder's attention mask is causal, like GPT2.*\n\nSource: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461\n\n![75300fd2-7bcd-4536-9a05-d2d9c5fc7eec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60737264/111874912-2bb46900-89bd-11eb-9f96-96495cab4fad.jpg)\n\nSource: https://paperswithcode.com/method/bart?hcb=1\n\n![1b721bdf-8a62-420e-b8f4-9b3b466a8ff2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60737264/111874942-3c64df00-89bd-11eb-990c-b94127d58a57.jpg)\n\nSource: https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_stt/?hcb=1\n\n",
