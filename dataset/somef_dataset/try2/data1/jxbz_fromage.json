      "excerpt": "An initial learning rate of 0.01 has worked well in all our experiments except model fine-tuning, where 0.001 worked well. Decaying the learning rate when the loss plateaus is a good idea.  \nOn some benchmarks, Fromage heavily overfit the training set. We were able to control this behaviour by setting the p_bound regularisation flag. This constrains the norm of each layer's weights to lie within a factor of p_bound times its intial value. \nWe've written an academic paper that proposes an optimisation algorithm based on a new geometric characterisation of deep neural networks. The paper is called: \nOn the distance between two neural networks and the stability of learning. \nYou can also check out a blog post with some interactive demos of the main idea: \nGetting to the bottom. \nWe're putting this code here so that you can test out our optimisation algorithm in your own applications, and also so that you can attempt to reproduce the experiments in our paper. \n",
