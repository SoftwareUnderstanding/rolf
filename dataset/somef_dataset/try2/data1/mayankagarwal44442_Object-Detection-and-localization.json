This repository contains the required services , messages needed to impregnate the package into a robotic system using ROS as it's middleware. The algorithm used caffe model of faster rcnn for object detection. \nRobot Operating System (ROS) is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. \n",
