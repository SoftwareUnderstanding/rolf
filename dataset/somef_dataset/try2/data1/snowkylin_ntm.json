The basic pseudocode is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport ntm.ntm_cell as ntm_cell\ncell = ntm_cell.NTMCell(\n    rnn_size=200,           # Size of hidden states of controller \n    memory_size=128,        # Number of memory locations (N)\n    memory_vector_dim=20,   # The vector size at each location (M)\n    read_head_num=1,        # # of read head\n    write_head_num=1,       # # of write head\n    addressing_mode='content_and_location', # Address Mechanisms, 'content_and_location' or 'content'\n    reuse=False,            # Whether to reuse the variable in the model (if the length of sequence is not fixed, you might need to build more than one model using the same variable, and this will be useful)\n)\nstate = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)\noutput_list = []\nfor t in range(seq_length):\n    output, state = cell(input[i], state)\n    output_list.append(output)\n```\n\n#### Train and Test\n\nTo train the model, run:\n\n```\npython copy_task.py\n```\nYou can specify training options including parameters to the model via flags, such as `--model` (default is NTM), `--batch_size` and so on. See code for more detail.\n\nTo test the model, run:\n\n```\npython copy_task.py --mode test\n```\n\nYou can specify testing options via flags such as `--test_seq_length`.\n\n### Result (Copy task)\n\n![](images/copy_task_head.png) | ![](images/copy_task_loss.png)\n---|---\nVector of weighting (left: read vector; right: write vector; shift range: 1) | Training loss\n\n## One-shot Learning with NTM (MANN)\n\n### Paper\n\nSantoro, Adam, et al. \"[One-shot learning with memory-augmented neural networks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065)\" _arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065_ (2016).\n\n### Usage\n\n#### Class MANNCell()\n\nThe usage of class `MANNCell` in `ntm/mann_cell.py` is similar to `tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell` in TensorFlow. The basic pseudocode is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport ntm.mann_cell as mann_cell\ncell = mann_cell.MANNCell(\n    rnn_size=200,           # Size of hidden states of controller \n    memory_size=128,        # Number of memory locations (N)\n    memory_vector_dim=40,   # The vector size at each location (M)\n    head_num=1,             # # of read & write head (in MANN, #(read head) = #(write head))\n    gamma=0.95              # Usage decay of the write weights (in eq 20)\n    k_strategy='separate'   # In the original MANN paper, query key vector 'k' are used in both reading (eq 17) and writing (eq 23). You can set k_strategy='summary' if you want this way. However, in the NTM paper they are esparated. If you set k_strategy='separate', the controller will generate a new add vector 'a' to replace the query vector 'k' in eq 23.\n)\nstate = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)\noutput_list = []\nfor t in range(seq_length):\n    output, state = cell(input[i], state)\n    output_list.append(output)\n```\n\nThere is another implementation of `MANNCell` translated from [tristandeleu's Theano version of MANN](https://github.com/tristandeleu/ntm-one-shot). You can find it in `ntm/mann_cell_2.py` and the usage is just the same. The performance is not fully tested but it seems to work fine too.\n\n#### Train and Test\n\nTo train the model, first you need to prepare the Omniglot dataset. Download [images_background.zip](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot/blob/master/python/images_background.zip) (964 classes) and [images_evaluation.zip](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot/blob/master/python/images_evaluation.zip) (679 classes), then combine them in a new `data` folder so you have 1623 classes. Your `data` folder may looks like:\n\n    /data\n        /Alphabet_of_the_Magi\n            /character01\n                0709_01.png\n                ...\n                0709_20.png\n            ...\n            /character20\n        ...\n        /ULOG\n\nThen, run:\n\n```\npython one_shot_learning.py\n```\n\nYou can specify training options including parameters to the model via flags, such as `--model` (default is MANN), `--batch_size` and so on. See code for more detail.\n\nTo test the model, run:\n\n```\npython one_shot_learning.py --mode test\n```\n\nYou can specify testing options via flags such as `--test_batch_num` (default: 100), `--n_train_classes` (default: 1200) and `--n_test_classes` (default: 423).\n\n### Result\n\nOmniglot Classification:\n\n![](images/LSTM_one_hot.png) | ![](images/MANN_one_hot.png)\n---|---\nLSTM, five random classes/episode, one-hot vector labels | MANN, five random classes/episode, one-hot vector labels\n![](images/LSTM_five_hot.png) | ![](images/MANN_five_hot.png)\nLSTM, fifteen random classes/episode, five-character string labels | MANN, fifteen random classes/episode, five-character string labels\n\nTest-set classification accuracies for LSTM and MANN trained on the Omniglot dataset, using one-hot encodings of labels and five classes presented per episode:\n\nModel | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | loss\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nLSTM | 0.2333 | 0.5897 | 0.6581 | 0.681 | 0.7077 | 0.7156 | 0.7141 | 0.7305 | 0.7281 | 0.7233 | 42.6427\nMANN | 0.3558 | 0.8881 | 0.9497 | 0.9651 | 0.9734 | 0.9744 | 0.9794 | 0.9798 | 0.978 | 0.9755 | 11.53",

You may convey such object\\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\\n\\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\\n   covered by this License.\\n\\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\\n   document.\\n\\n  4. Combined Works.\\n\\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\\nthe following:\\n\\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\\n   covered by this License.\\n\\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\\n   document.\\n\\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\\n\\n   d) Do one of the following:\\n\\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\\n       Corresponding Source.\\n\\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user\\'s computer\\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\\n       Version.\\n\\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\\n\\n  5. Combined Libraries.\\n\\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\\n\\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\\n\\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\\n\\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\\n\\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\\n\\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\\n\\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\\napply, that proxy\\'s public statement of acceptance of any version is\\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\\nLibrary.\\n'",
