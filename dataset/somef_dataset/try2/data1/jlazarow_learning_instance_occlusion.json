We extend it to:\n\n1. Support [Panoptic Segmentation/Panoptic FPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02446)\n2. Support learning an instance-wise relationship to determine occlusion\n3. Integrate this into the [existing greedy merging heuristic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868)\n\nIf you make use of the ideas or code in this project, please consider citing:\n\n```\n@InProceedings{Lazarow_2020_CVPR,\nauthor = {Lazarow, Justin and Lee, Kwonjoon and Shi, Kunyu and Tu, Zhuowen},\ntitle = {Learning Instance Occlusion for Panoptic Segmentation},\nbooktitle = {The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\nmonth = {June},\nyear = {2020}\n}\n```\n",
