Install [pycocotools](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi).\n\n```shell\npip3 install cython; pip3 install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#:subdirectory=PythonAPI'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Demo</summary>\n\nStep1. Download a pretrained model from the benchmark table.\n\nStep2. Use either -n or -f to specify your detector's config. For example:\n\n```shell\npython tools/demo.py image -n yolox-s -c /path/to/your/yolox_s.pth --path assets/dog.jpg --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --save_result --device [cpu/gpu]\n```\nor\n```shell\npython tools/demo.py image -f exps/default/yolox_s.py -c /path/to/your/yolox_s.pth --path assets/dog.jpg --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --save_result --device [cpu/gpu]\n```\nDemo for video:\n```shell\npython tools/demo.py video -n yolox-s -c /path/to/your/yolox_s.pth --path /path/to/your/video --conf 0.25 --nms 0.45 --tsize 640 --save_result --device [cpu/gpu]\n```\n\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Reproduce our results on COCO</summary>\n\nStep1. Prepare COCO dataset\n```shell\ncd <YOLOX_HOME>\nln -s /path/to/your/COCO ./datasets/COCO\n```\n\nStep2. Reproduce our results on COCO by specifying -n:\n\n```shell\npython tools/train.py -n yolox-s -d 8 -b 64 --fp16 -o [--cache]\n                         yolox-m\n                         yolox-l\n                         yolox-x\n```\n* -d: number of gpu devices\n* -b: total batch size, the recommended number for -b is num-gpu * 8\n* --fp16: mixed precision training\n* --cache: caching imgs into RAM to accelarate training, which need large system RAM. \n\nWhen using -f, the above commands are equivalent to:\n```shell\npython tools/train.py -f exps/default/yolox_s.py -d 8 -b 64 --fp16 -o [--cache]\n                         exps/default/yolox_m.py\n                         exps/default/yolox_l.py\n                         exps/default/yolox_x.py\n```\n  \n**Multi Machine Training**\n\nWe also support multi-nodes training. Just add the following args:\n* --num\\_machines: num of your total training nodes\n* --machine\\_rank: specify the rank of each node\n\nSuppose you want to train YOLOX on 2 machines, and your master machines's IP is 123.123.123.123, use port 12312 and TCP.  \nOn master machine, run\n```shell\npython tools/train.py -n yolox-s -b 128 --dist-url tcp://123.123.123.123:12312 --num-machines 2 --machine-rank 0\n```\nOn the second machine, run\n```shell\npython tools/train.py -n yolox-s -b 128 --dist-url tcp://123.123.123.123:12312 --num-machines 2 --machine-rank 1\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Evaluation</summary>\n\nWe support batch testing for fast evaluation:\n\n```shell\npython tools/eval.py -n  yolox-s -c yolox_s.pth -b 64 -d 8 --conf 0.001 [--fp16] [--fuse]\n                         yolox-m\n                         yolox-l\n                         yolox-x\n```\n* --fuse: fuse conv and bn\n* -d: number of GPUs used for evaluation. DEFAULT: All GPUs available will be used.\n* -b: total batch size across on all GPUs\n\nTo reproduce speed test, we use the following command:\n```shell\npython tools/eval.py -n  yolox-s -c yolox_s.pth -b 1 -d 1 --conf 0.001 --fp16 --fuse\n                         yolox-m\n                         yolox-l\n                         yolox-x\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tutorials</summary>\n\n*  [Training on custom data](docs/train_custom_data.md)\n*  [Manipulating training image size](docs/manipulate_training_image_size.md)\n\n</details>\n\n",
