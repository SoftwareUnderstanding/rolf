      "excerpt": "Embeddings: To create the feature vectors I used the Infersent embedding model created by Facebook. The reason was solely based on using the sentence embeddings instead of word vectors because documents and questions are longer text and sentence embeddings will be better representation. Among sentence embeddings I choosen infersent because it has better performance to many downstream NLP tasks then others. This was experimented in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364. In this they have evaluated number of sentence embedding models and Infersent model has performed better then the rest. \nI created two features cosine similarity and euclidean distance between the question and each sentence of the document.
