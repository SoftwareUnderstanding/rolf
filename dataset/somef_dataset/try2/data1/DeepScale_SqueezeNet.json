      "excerpt": "In this repository, we include Caffe-compatible files for the model architecture, the solver configuration, and the pretrained model (4.8MB uncompressed). \nBatch size. We have experimented with batch sizes ranging from 32 to 1024. In this repo, our default batch size is 512. If implemented naively on a single GPU, a batch size this large may result in running out of memory. An effective workaround is to use hierarchical batching (sometimes called \"delayed batching\"). Caffe supports hierarchical batching by doing train_val.prototxt&gt;batch_size training samples concurrently in memory. After solver.prototxt&gt;iter_size iterations, the gradients are summed and the model is updated. Mathematically, the batch size is batch_size * iter_size. In the included prototxt files, we have set (batch_size=32, iter_size=16), but any combination of batch_size and iter_size that multiply to 512 will produce eqivalent results. In fact, with the same random number generator seed, the model will be fully reproducable if trained multiple times. Finally, note that in Caffe iter_size is applied while training on the training set but not while testing on  the test set. \nImplementing Fire modules. In the paper, we describe the expand portion of the Fire layer as a collection of 1x1 and 3x3 filters. Caffe does not natively support a convolution layer that has multiple filter sizes. To work around this, we implement expand1x1 and expand3x3 layers and concatenate the results together in the channel dimension. \nThe SqueezeNet team has released a few variants of SqueezeNet. Each of these include pretrained models, and the non-compressed versions include training protocols, too. \nSqueezeNet v1.0 (in this repo), the base model described in our SqueezeNet paper. \nCompressed SqueezeNet v1.0, as described in the SqueezeNet paper. \nSqueezeNet v1.0 with Residual Connections, which delivers higher accuracy without increasing the model size. \nSqueezeNet v1.0 with Dense\u2192Sparse\u2192Dense (DSD) Training, which delivers higher accuracy without increasing the model size. \n",
