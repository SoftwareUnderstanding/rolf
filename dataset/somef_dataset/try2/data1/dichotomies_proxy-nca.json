      "excerpt": "Note that negative log with softmax is used as ProxyNCA loss. Therefore, the anchor-positive-proxy distance is not excluded in the denominator. In practice, I have not noticed a difference. \nThe importance of scaling of the normalized proxies and embeddings is mentioned in the ProxyNCA paper (in the theoretical background), but the exact scaling factors are ommitted. I have found that (3, 3) work well for CUB and Cars and (8, 1) work well for SOP (first being for proxies and latter for embeddings). \n",
