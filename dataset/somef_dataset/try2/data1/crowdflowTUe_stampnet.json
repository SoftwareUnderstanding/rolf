      "excerpt": "StampNet is a way for performing multi-class multi-object object discovery. Well, sort of, as it is designed to discover and cluster abstract shapes, not real-world or ImageNet-style images.  \nIt is easier to see StampNet as a localising multi k-means clustering using neural networks. Besides finding k clusters by minimising MSE, the network can also: \n",

      "excerpt": "Besides the results and applications we show in the paper, StampNet can also be used in other ways. For example: \n- StampNet can perform a better clustering of Omniglot compared to, say, k-means clustering. If the cluster size are smaller and the network localises the clusters, it makes them more translation invariant resulting in a better clustering. (Not in the paper due to page limit constraint) \nThe method is fairly robust. The network uses M stamps per image, but even when there are less than M objects per image, it still manages to reproduce the image properly by learning an empty stamp. When there are more than M objects in the image, the network learns to localise the objects with the highest average pixel value. (Not in the paper due to page limit constraint) \nStampNet is an autoencoder with a discrete latent space, e.g. it tries to reproduce the input image. The discrete latent space consists of three gumbel softmax that predict the (x, y) coordinate and which stamp s we should use. We then place the predicted stamp at the predicted coordinate to reproduce the image. For more details, see the paper. \n",
