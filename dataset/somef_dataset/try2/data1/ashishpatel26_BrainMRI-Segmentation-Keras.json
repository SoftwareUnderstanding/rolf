      "excerpt": "The Brain MRI of each patient is a 3-dimensional voxel datasets. A single image is 256x256 in size while the depth varies between patients. The datasets include labels which classify 135 different sections of the brain. \nWe will randomly sample a small voxel as input the the neural network. Since not all pixels in the datasets contain meaningful data and some useful sub-image may be placed near boundary of the dataset, zero-padding is added to the boundary of the dataset at first. Then the dataset will be normalized and equalized. During training and testing, the sampling processing will filter the zero-valued pixel so only voxel that contain meaningful data will be fed into the network. \nUsing Keras, we implemented a function which return a Keras model object of residual block and by calling it multiple times with desired parameters (e.g. no. of filters to use, transformation of volume between input and output), we formed a network which only takes in a 26x26x26 voxel of MRI images. \nThis size of voxel can carry 8 times more of information than the original 13x13x13 voxel in [2]. We have experimented our network with 2D patch input and found that it doesn\u2019t contribute much to the accuracy so in this we discarded it to focus on training a 3D voxel residual network. We particularly employed the full pre\u2010activation version of residual block presented in [3], where Kaiming He found that such version offers much better training performance than the original ResNet. \nKeras implementation of single Residual Block: \n",
