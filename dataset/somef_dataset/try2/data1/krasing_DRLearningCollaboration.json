      "excerpt": "This repository contains material related to the Collaboration and Competition project of the Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program. \nIn this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play. \nThe observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. A sequence of 3 observations are stacked together. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. \nThe task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically, \nAfter each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores. \n",

(__Linux__ or __Mac__)\n\t```bash\n\tconda create --name drlnd python=3.6\n\tsource activate drlnd\n\t```\n\n2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git\ncd deep-reinforcement-learning/python\npip install .\n```\n\n3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  \n```bash\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name \"drlnd\"\n```\n\n4. Download the Unity Environment:\n\n    Download [this file](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip) for Linux operating system. Decompress in the same folder where the project files are. This project uses rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) but you will not need to install Unity - the environment is already built into the downloaded file.\n\n",
