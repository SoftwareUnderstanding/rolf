      "excerpt": "During training and testing of the algorithm I found the best way to tackle exploration - exploitation dilemma is to use a softmax action selection with decreasing temperature.<br/> \nAlthough epsilon greedy action selection is an effective and popular means of balancing exploration - exploitation in reinforcement learning, one drawback is that when it explores it chooses equally among all actions. This drawback can be corrected by using a probability based action selection algorithm, like the softmax action selection implemented in this repository.<br/> \n",

      "excerpt": "With the temperature continuously dropping, the action selection drops from 80% exploration down to approx. 10% exploration at the end of the training. The Agent learns much faster given that even if the action selection is not greedy, it is based on probabilities. \nExperience replay lets reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experiences from the past. Without prioritisation, experience transitions were uniformly sampled from a replay memory. However, this approach simply replays transitions at the same frequency that they were originally experienced, regardless of their significance. The prioritised experience replay essentially gives weights to different experiences based on their importance in the learning process, speeding up the learning process and making it more efficient. PER, generally, can be achieved in two ways: ranking and stochastic prioritisation. The repository demonstrates a stochastic method implemented as show below:<br/> \n",

The Softmax action selection (Boltzmann score, \"epsilon\" on the left y axis below) shows what was the exploration rate during training. This Doesn't mean that the Agent selected a random action at the beginning of the training session, but it shows how many times the Agent chooses other than the most-optimal Action.  \n2. Scores: in Pong the maximum score is 21 points, while the lowest score one can receive is -21.  \n3. Loss: As part of the double architecture, I sat the weight-share between Primary network and Target network to 10,000 steps. As we can see on the Loss values, this frequency proven helpful to minimize the Loss.  \n",
