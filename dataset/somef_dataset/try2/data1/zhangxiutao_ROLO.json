The spatially supervised regression acts as an online appearance model. (2) Temporally, the LSTM learns over the sequence units to restrict the location prediction to a spatial range.  \nROLO is currently an offline approach, and is expected to gain a performance boost with proper online model updating. It is still a single object tracker, and data association techniques are not yet explored for the simultaneous tracking of multiple targets. \nAs deep learning applications get mature, it will be more efficient to have multi-functional networks consisted of orthogonal modules. Feature representation, in this case, had better be trained separately to provide shared features. Pre-training of visual features from ImageNet are skipped, as were discussed already in YOLO. We focus on training the LSTM module. \n",

Nevertheless, as the performance of ROLO depends on the YOLO part, we choose the default YOLO small model in order to provide a fair comparison. We believed it unfair to give credit to the tracking module if we train a customized YOLO model. The model is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and finetuned on VOC dataset, capable of detecting objects of only 20 classes. We therefore picked 30 out of 100 videos from the benchmark [OTB100](http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/datasets.html), where the tracking targets belong to these classes.
