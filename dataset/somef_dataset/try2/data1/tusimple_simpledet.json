The preprocessing methods of the detector is implemented through DetectionAugmentation. \nImage/bbox-related preprocessing, such as Norm2DImage and Resize2DImageBbox. \nAnchor generator AnchorTarget2D, which generates anchors and corresponding anchor targets for training RPN. \nNetwork Structure. The training and testing symbols of Faster-RCNN detector is defined in FasterRcnn. The key components are listed as follow: \nBackbone. Backbone provides interfaces to build backbone networks, e.g. ResNet and ResNext. \nNeck. Neck provides interfaces to build complementary feature extraction layers for backbone networks, e.g. FPNNeck builds Top-down pathway for Feature Pyramid Network. \nRPN head. RpnHead aims to build classification and regression layers to generate proposal outputs for RPN. Meanwhile, it also provides interplace to generate sampled proposals for the subsequent R-CNN. \nRoi Extractor. RoiExtractor extracts features for each roi (proposal) based on the R-CNN features generated by Backbone and Neck. \n",
