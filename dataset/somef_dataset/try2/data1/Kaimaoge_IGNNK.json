      "excerpt": "In many applications, placing sensors with fully spatial coverage may be impractical. Installation and maintenance costs of devices can also limit the number of sensors deployed in a network. A better kriging model can achieve higher estimation accuracy/reliability with less number of sensors, thus reducing the operation and maintenance cost of a sensor network. The kriging results can produce a fine-grained and high-resolution realization of spatiotemporal data, which can be used to enhance real-world applications such as travel time estimation and disaster evaluation. \nA limitation with traditional methods is that they are essentially transductive, for new sensors/nodes introduced to the network, we cannot directly apply a previously trained model; instead, we have to retrain the full model even with only minor changes. Conversely, we develop an Inductive Graph Neural Network Kriging (IGNNK) model in this work. \n",

      "excerpt": "The goal of spatiotemporal kriging is to perform signal interpolation for unsampled locations given the observed signals from sampled locations during the same period. We first randomly select a subset of nodes from all available sensors and create a corresponding subgraph. We mask some of them as missing and train the GNN to reconstruct the full signals of all nodes (including both the observed and the masked nodes) on the subgraph. \n",
