      "excerpt": "This is my 2nd attempt on this topic. \nWhile research on this topic, I chanced upon this Kaggle competition. In their discussion, the winner and 3rd place winner just simply used all the pre-train model and retrain it without freezing and still get pretty good result (Leadership board max 0.72483).  \nPreviously if you recalled, there is another technique which I know, called tensorflow model API but I hit into some error while working on xml_to_csv, I then gave up. This time, I re-look on this again. Followed a Youtube tutorial, I was able to train fashion dataset on Faster_RCNN model with XML annotation's XY information. I want to know whether it is possible to achieve better result JUST by using a more advance model (Faster_RCNN) without the use of attributes. If this works well, then the problem with by previous attempts is just fine-tuning my custom CNN parameters, and I had to take ROI into consideration. \nTrained for almost 5 hours, after 96523 epochs, see tensorboard below, the lost managed to goes as low as 0.03841, not too bad. Not sure how to use tensoreboard to show accuarcy, sorry. The generated inference graph too large to push into github \n",

      "excerpt": "Conclusion: Why I choose Faster_RCNN? Because I found this table below in one of the papers. Well Faster_RCNN model works pretty well as you can see. I think the XML's ROI information helps a lot as well. \nOK, OK.. I know.. the above is job well done by Google. I'm actually quite happy with it, well it does the job. Reminder, my knowledge on computer vision is only 2.5 months ago. It's has always been my wish to code faster-rcnn from scratch, maybe start from using keras, which I'm more familiar. I found this github repo for reference. Let's do this, and try this without API... \n",
