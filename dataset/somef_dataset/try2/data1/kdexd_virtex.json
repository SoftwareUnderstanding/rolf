        "body": "Bug Fix: Beam Search\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe beam search implementation adapted from AllenNLP was more suited for LSTM/GRU (recurrent models), less for transformers (autoregressive models).\r\nThis version removes the \"backpointer\" trick from AllenNLP implementation and improves captioning results for all VirTex models. See below, \"Old\" metrics are `v1.1` (ArXiv v2) and \"New\" metrics are `v1.2` (ArXiv v3).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10494087/125861769-4c578439-d83b-4815-8167-200d97248038.png)\r\n\r\n_This bug does not affect pre-training or other downstream task results._ Thanks to Nicolas Carion (@alcinos) and Aishwarya Kamath (@ashkamath) for spotting this issue and helping me to fix it!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature: Nucleus Sampling\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThis codebase now supports decoding through Nucleus Sampling, as introduced in [The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09751). Try running [captioning evaluation script](https://github.com/kdexd/virtex/blob/master/scripts/eval_captioning.py) with `--config-override MODEL.DECODER.NAME nucleus_sampling MODEL.DECODER.NUCLEUS_SIZE 0.9`! To have consistent behavior with prior versions, the default decoding method is Beam Search with 5 beams.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Nucleus sampling would give worse results specifically on COCO Captions, but will produce more interesting sounding language with larger transformers trained on much more data than COCO Captions.\r\n\r\n**New config arguments to support this:**\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nMODEL:\r\n  DECODER:\r\n    # What algorithm to use for decoding. Supported values: {\"beam_search\",\r\n    # \"nucleus_sampling\"}.\r\n    NAME: \"beam_search\"\r\n\r\n    # Number of beams to decode (1 = greedy decoding). Ignored when decoding\r\n    # through nucleus sampling.\r\n    BEAM_SIZE: 5\r\n\r\n    # Size of nucleus for sampling predictions. Ignored when decoding through\r\n    # beam search.\r\n    NUCLEUS_SIZE: 0.9\r\n\r\n    # Maximum length of decoded caption. Decoding may end earlier when [EOS]\r\n    # token is sampled.\r\n    MAX_DECODING_STEPS: 50  # Same as DATA.MAX_CAPTION_LENGTH\r\n```\r\n",

By default, the script will only evaluate on global average pooled features (2048-d), as with the CVPR 2021 paper version.\r\n\r\n- Removed `virtex.modules.visual_backbones.BlindVisualBackbone`. I introduced it a long time ago for debugging, it is not much useful anymore.\r\n\r\n### Two config-related changes:\r\n\r\n1. Renamed config parameters: (`OPTIM.USE_LOOKAHEAD` \u2014> `OPTIM.LOOKAHEAD.USE`), (`OPTIM.LOOKAHEAD_ALPHA` \u2014> `OPTIM.LOOKAHEAD_ALPHA`) and (`OPTIM.LOOKAHEAD_STEPS` \u2014> `OPTIM.LOOKAHEAD.STEPS`).\r\n\r\n2. Renamed `TransformerTextualHead` to `TransformerDecoderTextualHead` for clarity. Model names in config also change accordingly: `\"transformer_postnorm\"` \u2014> `\"transdec_postnorm\"` (same for prenorm).\r\n\r\nThese changes may be breaking if you wrote your own config and explicitly added these arguments.",
