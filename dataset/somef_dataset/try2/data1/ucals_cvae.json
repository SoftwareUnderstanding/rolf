      "excerpt": "This tutorial implements [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generati) paper, which introduced Conditional Variational Auto-encoders in 2015, using Pyro PPL.\n\nSupervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. \nAlthough it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. \nIn this work, Kihyuk Sohn, Honglak Lee and Xinchen Yan develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. \nThe model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. \nThey called the model Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE).\n\nThe CVAE is a conditional directed graphical model whose input observations modulate the prior on Gaussian latent variables that generate the outputs. \nIt is trained to maximize the conditional marginal log-likelihood. \nThe authors formulate the variational learning objective of the CVAE in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). \nIn experiments, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVAE in comparison to the deterministic neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output predictions using stochastic inference. \nHere, we will implement their proof of concept: an artificial experimental setting for structured output prediction using MNIST database.\n\n",

      "excerpt": "For qualitative analysis, we visualize the generated output samples in the next figure. As we can see, the baseline NNs can only make a single deterministic prediction, and as a result the output looks blurry and doesn\u2019t look realistic in many cases. In contrast, the samples generated by the CVAE models are more realistic and diverse in shape; sometimes they can even change their identity (digit labels), such as from 3 to 5 or from 4 to 9, and vice versa. \n",

One of the limitations of deterministic neural networks is that they generate only a single prediction. \nIn the example above, the input shows a small part of a digit that might be a three or a five. \n\n",
