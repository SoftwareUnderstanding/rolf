      "excerpt": "Nobel laureate Herbert Simon wrote, \"In order to have anything like a complete theory of human rationality, we have to understand what role emotion plays in it.\"\n\nIndustries are rapidly changing with the rapid growth of Artifical Intelligence. When it comes to understand human decisions, there are various factors that we have to take into consideration and one of them is emotion. Emotions can act as a bias to many of our day to day decision making. In this project, I attempt to use the 'Chicago Faces Database' to identify one of 4 emotions: Happy, Fear, Anger, and Neutral.\n\nThe 'Chicago Faces Database' is unbalanced. The approximate distribution of models is shown below:\n```\nNeutral - 50%\nHappy - 25%\nFear - 12.5%\nAnger - 12.5%\n```\n\nAs a solution to this distribution, I trained to models which are the 'NeutralModel' and the 'EmotionModel'. The NeutralModel predicts whether the emotion shown is Neutral or not. If the model proves negative in the NeutralModel, the image is sent to the EmotionModel which predicts the specific emotion. An attempt of dividing the EmotionModel into a 'HappyModel' and a 'FearOrAngerModel' will be tested to check if it performs better. The current model acts as a 'binary -> categorical' sequence. Dividing the EmotionModel will be like having a DecisionTree.\n\nThe model is trained using TensorFlow-GPU. The validation set is 20% of the original data. The NeutralModel performed with a peak validation accuracy of 79%. The EmotionModel performed with a peak validation accuracy of 84%. \n\n\nDemo below shows the sample performance of the the past model.\n![](src/demo.gif)\n\n",
