      "excerpt": "UNet++, a convolutional neural network dedicated for biomedical image segmentation, was designed, and applied in 2018 by (Zhou et al., 2018). UNet++ was basically designed to overcome some of the short comings of the UNet architecture. UNet works on the idea of skip connections. U-Net concatenates them and add convolutions and non-linearities between each up-sampling block. The skip connections recover the full spatial resolution at the network output, making fully convolutional methods suitable for semantic segmentation. UNet and other segmentation models based on the encoder-decoder architecture tend to fuse semantically dissimilar feature maps from the encoder and decoder sub-networks, which may degrade segmentation performance. This is where UNet++ is shown to have an edge over the other players as it bridges the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder prior to fusion thus improving the segmentation performance and output.\n\n",

      "excerpt": "UNet and FCNs have attained the state-of-the-art status in the field of medical image segmentation. The encoder-decoder structure are widely used in almost every semantic and instance segmentation task. Their success is largely attributed to the design of the skip connections that combine the deep, semantic, coarse-grained feature maps from the decoder sub-network with shallow, low-level, fine-grained feature maps from the encoder sub-network. However, the network structure and the design of the skip connections suffer from the following limitations.  \n1.  The network depth could vary from task to task largely attributed to the amount of the data available and the complexity of the segmentation task. \n2.  The design of skip connections employed is very much restrictive, such that it expects encoder and decoder feature maps to be fused be at the same scale. \nThe evolution goes through 3 different architectural phases with each phase improving the limitations of the previous one. The three different phases are  -  \n",

      "excerpt": "\u201cUNet++ is constructed from U-Nets by connecting the decoders, resulting in densely connected skip connections, enabling dense feature propagation along skip connections and thus more flexible feature fusion at the decoder nodes. As a result, each node in the UNet++ decoders, from a horizontal perspective, combines multiscale features from its all preceding nodes at the same resolution, and from a vertical perspective, integrates multiscale features across different resolutions from its preceding node. This multiscale feature aggregation of UNet++ gradually synthesizes the segmentation, leading to increased accuracy and faster convergence.\u201d \nUNet++ model is designed and put to training for a brain tumor segmentation task. The network parameters are chosen as per the implementation in the original paper (Zhou et al., 2018). The model is trained over 30 epochs on brain tumor data available at (Brain Tumor Dataset, n.d.). The dataset consists of 3064 brain tumor images along with their masks. For training purpose, the data is divided into training, validation and tests sets each having 2800, 200 and 64 images respectively. \nThe network is trained with the below parameters set. \n",
