There are two non-learning baseline agents: RandomAgent and FixedActionAgent. The RandomAgent chooses a random action at every timestep, and the FixedActionAgent chooses the same action at every timestep. Try running the agent locally to gain some intuition about the environment and the competition. \n",

Also note that you can only submit 5 times each 24 hours ([Issue #141](https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/osim-rl/issues/141)).\n\n\n\n",
