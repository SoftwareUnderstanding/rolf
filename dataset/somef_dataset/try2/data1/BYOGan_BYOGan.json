      "excerpt": "A Generative Adversarial Network GAN is a neural network based model that aims to learn the Data Distribution of a given Dataset in order to sample from this learned distribution and generate realistic looking Data, in other words after a successful learning process a GAN can effitiently produce Data that is hardly indistinguishable from real Data. \nA GAN is composed of two competing networks: a Generator and a Discriminator \n+ the Generator uses input from a Latent Vector and tries to produce realistic Data \n+ the Discriminator, having access to real Data, tries to classify input into two classes: Real data and Fake Data. \nSince the introduction of GANs, many models have been implemented based on this architecture, but less effort has been put to understand parameters affecting GANs. Also GANs remain a difficult subject to beginners. \nThat is why we propose this product which allows advanced and customised configuration of GANs, helps track the learning of the configured model via the visualization of the generated samples as well as via the evolution of the network losses. \n",
