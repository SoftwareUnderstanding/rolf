      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802.\n## Introduction\nTo date, most open access public smart meter datasets are still at 30-minute or hourly temporal resolution. While this level of granularity could be sufficient for billing or deriving aggregated generation or consumption patterns, it may not fully capture the weather transients or consumption spikes. One potential solution is to synthetically interpolate high resolution data from commonly accessible lower resolution data, for this work, the SRGAN model is used for this purpose.\n## Requirements\n* Python 2.7.13 \n* tensorflow==1.9.0\n* Keras==2.2.4\n* numpy==1.15.2\n* pandas==0.23.4\n## Datasets\nThe pretrained models are trained using one year of PV & consumption power data of 2340 Australian households, collected by Solar Analytics (https://www.solaranalytics.com/au/"
