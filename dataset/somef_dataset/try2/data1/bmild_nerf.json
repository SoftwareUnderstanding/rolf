The network directly maps from spatial location and viewing direction (5D input) to color and opacity (4D output), acting as the \"volume\" so we can use volume rendering to differentiably render new views. \nOptimizing a NeRF takes between a few hours and a day or two (depending on resolution) and only requires a single GPU. Rendering an image from an optimized NeRF takes somewhere between less than a second and ~30 seconds, again depending on resolution. \n",
