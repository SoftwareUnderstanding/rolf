It can be used to\nconstruct neural networks for many different purposes (un/supervised learning,\nreinforcement learning, ...). We find it is a successful abstraction for our\norganization, you might too!\n\nMore specifically, Sonnet provides a simple but powerful programming model\ncentered around a single concept: `snt.Module`. Modules can hold references to\nparameters, other modules and methods that apply some function on the user\ninput. Sonnet ships with many predefined modules (e.g. `snt.Linear`,\n`snt.Conv2D`, `snt.BatchNorm`) and some predefined networks of modules (e.g.\n`snt.nets.MLP`) but users are also encouraged to build their own modules.\n\nUnlike many frameworks Sonnet is extremely unopinionated about **how** you will\nuse your modules. Modules are designed to be self contained and entirely\ndecoupled from one another. Sonnet does not ship with a training framework and\nusers are encouraged to build their own or adopt those built by others.\n\nSonnet is also designed to be simple to understand, our code is (hopefully!)\nclear and focussed. Where we have picked defaults (e.g. defaults for initial\nparameter values) we try to point out why.\n\n",
