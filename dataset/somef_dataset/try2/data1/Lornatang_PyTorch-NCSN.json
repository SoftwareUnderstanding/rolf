We first perturb our training data by different Gaussian noise with progressively smaller variances. Next, we estimate the score function for each perturbed data distribution, by training a shared neural network named the Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) using score matching. We can directly produce samples from our NSCN with annealed Langevin dynamics. \n",
