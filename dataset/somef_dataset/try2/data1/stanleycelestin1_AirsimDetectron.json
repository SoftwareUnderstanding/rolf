Larger\nchanges (e.g., changesets implementing a new paper) will be released on a more\nperiodic basis.\nPull Requests\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from master.\nIf you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\nIf you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code lints.\nEnsure no regressions in baseline model speed and accuracy.\nIf you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\").\n\nContributor License Agreement (\"CLA\")\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need\nto do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.\nComplete your CLA here: https://code.facebook.com/cla\nIssues\nGitHub issues will be largely unattended and are mainly intended as a community\nforum for collectively debugging issues, hopefully leading to pull requests with\nfixes when appropriate.\nCoding Style\n\n4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs\n80 character line length\nPEP8 formatting\n\nLicense\nBy contributing to Detectron, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.",
