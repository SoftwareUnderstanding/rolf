This uses the ShiftResNet codebase written by Alvin Wan and label-refinery by Hessam Bagherinezhad. \nDiracDeltaNet is an efficient convolution neural network tailored for embedded FPGAs on ImageNet classification task. Its macro-architecture originates from ShuffleNet V2. DiracDeltaNet is codesigned with its embedded FPGA accelerator. It has the following features: \nThe operator set in DiracDeltaNet is shrunk to 1x1 convolution, 2x2 max pooling, shift, channel shuffle and concatenation  for hardware efficiency \nAll of the 3x3 convolutions in ShuffleNet V2 are replaced with shift operations and 1x1 convolutions \nSeveral 2x2 max-pooling layers are added and the kernel size of the existing 3x3 max-pooling are reduced to 2x2 \n",
