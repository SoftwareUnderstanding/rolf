You can follow the instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda\">here</a>\n\n\n```bash\n#: ex. CUDA 11.1\n$ pip install --upgrade \"jax[cuda111]\" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html\n```\n\nFor running any scripts, you'll notice that it will always be prepended with `poetry run`\n\n",
