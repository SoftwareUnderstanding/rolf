      "excerpt": "The user draws an image using given colors. Each of these colors represents a \"segment\" or type of object being present at that pixel. When they are satisfied with their sketch, they can click a button and the image will be uploaded into the backend of our program hosted on the Google Cloud. The program converts the image to a more readable form and passes it into a folder where we use NVIDIA's pre-trained models to create a synthesized image using learned traits about each texture and object and the pixel map the user submitted. This image is then displayed on the website for the user to see. \n\n...\n\nOne thing our program does not do is generate an instance map. The instance map segments the image into different instances of objects - and makes sure that if two of the same object are overlapping each other, they have different pixel values. Detecting and working past overlapping images is a hard problem for computer vision, and this helps generate higher fidelity images. However, we thought that the end user would not enjoy having to sketch another image, and would probably not be submitting very complex drawing with many overlapping figures, so we omitted using this in the model. \n\n",

      "excerpt": "A few months ago, some of us saw the NVIDIA demo of their GuaGAN model for semantic image synthesis. It blew us away. Unfortunately, unlike their StyleGAN model, they did not quickly release the source code, and everyone was left wanting more of this breakthrough tech.  \nFortunately, whilst one group member was playing on their phone on the bus to the hackathon, they noticed a repo called \"SPADE\" that had just been made public by NVIDIA research on GitHub. It turns out this contained all their code, along with some pretrained models using GuaGAN! The repo was made public Friday, April 12th.  \nFor those inclinded, the paper (which has gotten accepted as an oral presentation to CVPR) can be found here. \nThe repo was made public the day we started working on it, so there was not much documentation \n",
