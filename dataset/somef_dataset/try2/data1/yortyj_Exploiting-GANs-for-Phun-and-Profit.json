      "excerpt": "But before we begin, why would someone want to exploit a GAN?  Are we talking about exploiting it while it's learning or at rest?  Exploitation at rest (EAR) may give the attacker a toehold into abusing and manipulating the output from the GAN whereas exploitation while learning (EWL) opens up a litany of questions on how this would happen, what access would the attacker need, and where in the process they'd need to place themselves to effect a modicum of hoped for manipulation.  Ultimately the final objective in attacking and abusing GANs must be set forth prior to the decision path being chosen.  But this still doesn't fully answer the question of why. \nWhile I love asking why, in this case I'd prefer to ask why not?  Some malicious actor is already asking this question so, why shouldn't we model potential scenarioes in which attacks take place against GANs and ask the theoretical questions such that they can be moved from theory into practice and the vulnerabilities then addressed?  As AI/ML/ANN/GAN becomes even more widespread and hackers see an opportunity to make money or have \"phun\" we must be looking at security now instead of later. \n",

      "excerpt": "Data Poisoning Attacks (DP) - poisoning input data such that models are unable to properly assign probabilities and thus labels; this has already been shown to work with image patching \n***Goodfellow:\"This is a real thing, already demonstrated in research papers against several kinds of ML models (SVMs, neural nets, etc)\" \nDiscriminiative Model Spoofing (DMS) - almost a type of denial of service attack wherein the discriminative model logic is poisoned and is unable to properly provide its adversarial services in the form of probability estimation of source data origin \nGoodfellow: \"Not sure what you mean. This would be an attack specifically on GAN training? Usually we're not too concerned about attackers who can mess with the training process, because that implies that they've already compromised your datacenter pretty thoroughly. It makes more sense to just defend the datacenter than to design an ML algorithm that can train on an adversarial platform. \nBut maybe you could design training sets for which GAN training fails, or learns to generate something bad. We do often consider problems where the attacker can influence the dataset, since the data for many tasks is collected from the outside world.\" \nDiscriminator Activation Function Injection (DAFJ) - I envision fuzzing coming into play here to determine if the activation threshold can be lessened or increased for the node to wrongly fire; if the output definition can be forced to exist in the absence of appropriate input or set of inputs for a known training model there's room for abuse.  If successfully executed against the Discriminator then any fake output from the generator could be perhaps be classified as the attacker sees fit. \n***Goodfellow:\"Again, we usually aren't too concerned about threat models where the attacker can interfere with the operation of the training algorithm, since that implies you're already in much bigger trouble.\" \nSource Abuse Mimicry Output Attack (SAMOA)  - GANs are good at mimicking virtually any distributions of data.  Presuming for a moment an attacker could control somehow either source data like in a DP exploit or in a MIM, the GAN could be abused to generate malicious or malformed output in any domain. \n***Goodfellow:\"Yes, I think this is an interesting research direction. The most similar work I know of is https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05983\" \np(y|x) Inversion Attack (PYXI) - This seems like it might be a downstream result of some other class of attack but think for a moment if an inversion attack could be constructed such that the learned probability of y given x is turned on its head somehow. \n",

Not a lot of books have been published on Adversarial Machine Learning, although many papers exist.
