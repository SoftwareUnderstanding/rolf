      "excerpt": "Octave convolution can be used as a replacement for vanilla convolution. It has been demonstrated by the authors that similar (sometimes better) accuracy can be achieved using octave convolution while saving a huge number of flops required. Model size in case of octave and vanilla convolutions is same.  \nVanilla convolution carries out high frequency convolution throughout all the inputs channels. Octave convolution on the other hand, partitions all channels into two parts: high frequency and low frequency. Low frequency channels are one octave smaller (height and width) compared to high frequency convolutions. Moreover, high and low frequency channels are combined with each other before sending out the outputs.   \nAs can be seen in the figure, each octave convolution module can have upto 4 branches inside it each doing vanilla convolution. The paths with green color, donot change the spatial dimensions going from input to output. However, the paths with red color either increase (Low-to-high) or decrease (High-to-low) the spatial dimensions going from input to output.  \nWhen going from high frequency input to low frequency output (HtoL path), a 2x2 pooling operation is done to get the downscaled input for convolution. So, the HtoL path is conv_vanilla(pool(in_high)) \nSimilarly when going from Low Frequency input to high frequency output (LtoH path), a vanilla convolution is topped with a bilinear interpolation to upsample the low resolution conv output. So, the LtoH path is bilenear_interpolation(vanilla_convolution(in_low)). \n",
