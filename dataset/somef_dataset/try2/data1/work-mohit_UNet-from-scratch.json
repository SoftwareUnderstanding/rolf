      "excerpt": "U-Net is an architecture for semantic segmentation. It consists of a contracting path and an expansive path. The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step we double the number of feature channels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (\u201cup-convolution\u201d) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution. At the final layer a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network has 23 convolutional layers. \nIn this repo , I have implemented the UNet Architecture from the scratch with the help of tensorflow. Above description is taken form Papers with code website. You can find the research paper link <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597'>here.</a> \n",
