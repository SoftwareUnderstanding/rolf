      "excerpt": "Accurately ranking the vast number of candidate detections is crucial for dense object detectors to achieve high performance. In this work, we propose to learn IoU-aware classification scores (**IACS**) that simultaneously represent the object presence confidence and localization accuracy, to produce a more accurate ranking of detections in dense object detectors. In particular, we design a new loss function, named **Varifocal Loss (VFL)**, for training a dense object detector to predict the IACS, and a new efficient star-shaped bounding box feature representation (the features at nine yellow sampling points) for estimating the IACS and refining coarse bounding boxes. Combining these two new components and a bounding box refinement branch, we build a new IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture, what we call **VarifocalNet** or **VFNet** for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO benchmark show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong baseline by ~2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best model VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN reaches a single-model single-scale AP of **55.1** on COCO `test-dev`, achieving the state-of-the-art performance among various object detectors.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"VFNet.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n  <p>Learning to Predict the IoU-aware Classification Score.</p>\n</div>\n\n",
