These can include textual extracts and their corresponding labels. The graph is then created as a MultiDigraph from [networkx] with the target and source columns from the input csv file. While generating the embeddings, the extracts from the labels are also considered and can be used to determine which label is the closest to the provided source(input text). In the example below, the 'test_graph_ae' method shows this. The dataset chosen for this demonstration is Google Quest QnA and as such any dataset having a source and a label column(textual contents) can be used to generate the embeddings. The main function for creating the Graph AutoEncoder embedding is the 'get_sdne_embeddings' method. This method takes as parameters: hidden_dims (denotes the hidden embedding dimension of the neural network), alpha and beta are empirical constants for finetuning the embeddings, epochs (number of training iterations), the dataframe along with the source and target labels. The model outputs a embedding matrix (no of entries, no of hidden dims) and the corresponding graph.

This part is based on the Graph Convolution Network paper. The GCNs are based on deep neural networks which operate on the node features and the normalized laplacian of the adjacency matrix of input graph. The GCNs are mainly used for node/subgraph classification tasks but here we are interested in capturing only the embeddings from the penultimate layer of the network. For this we create an Embedding based on Tensorflow as node features. We define that the nodes that don\u2019t have predecessors are in layer 0. The embeddings of these nodes are just their features. To calculate the embeddings of layer k we weight the average embeddings of layer k-1 and put it into an activation function.
