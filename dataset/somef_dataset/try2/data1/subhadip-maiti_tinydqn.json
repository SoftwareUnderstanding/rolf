      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf).\n\nThe two Q-networks (online DQN and target DQN) have 3 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers (including the output layer). This code implements a replay memory and \u025b-greedy policy for exploration.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* OpenAI gym + dependencies for the Atari environment\n* TensorFlow 1.0+\n* Numpy\n\n## Installation\n\n### On MacOSX\n\n    $ brew install cmake boost boost-python sdl2 swig wget\n    $ cd $your_work_directory\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/tiny-dqn.git\n    $ cd tiny-dqn\n    $ pip install --user --upgrade pip\n    $ pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt\n    $ python tiny_dqn.py -v --render\n\n### On Ubuntu 14.04\n\n    $ apt-get install -y python-numpy python-dev cmake zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev xvfb libav-tools xorg-dev python-opengl libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev swig\n    $ cd $your_work_directory\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/tiny-dqn.git\n    $ cd tiny-dqn\n    $ vim requirements.txt\n    $ pip install --user --upgrade pip\n    $ pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt\n    $ python tiny_dqn.py -v --render\n\n## Usage\n\nTo train the model:\n\n    python tiny_dqn.py -v --number-steps 1000000\n\nThe model is saved to `my_dqn.ckpt` by default. To view it in action, run:\n\n    python tiny_dqn.py --test --render\n\nFor more options:\n\n    python tiny_dqn.py --help\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis is a draft, I have not had the time to test it seriously yet.
