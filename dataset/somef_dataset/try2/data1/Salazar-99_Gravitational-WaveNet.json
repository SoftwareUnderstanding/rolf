      "excerpt": "Event detection of binary mergers via gravitational-wave observations at LIGO requires processing very noisy signals to identify physical parameters. This typically involves generating synthetic data in the form of waveform template banks, spectral analysis, fourier analysis, and performing matched-filtering. All of these steps are computationally expensive and require human-generated heuristics and oversight.  \nThis project is an experiment designed to form a baseline on the performance of deep learning on a noisy time-series classification problem. The architecture used is named Gravitational-WaveNet for its use of dilated causal-convolutions as introduced in the 2016 WaveNet paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499). \nThe model is trained to classify a signal of fixed length as either containing or not containing a gravitational wave signature. The positive class consists of synthetic gravitational waveforms for like-mass binary mergers generated using the PyCBC library with additive Gaussian noise to achieve a specified signal-to-noise ratio. The waveforms are generated with masses equally spaced in the range specified by the user. The negative class is standard normal gaussian noise.  \nThe structure of the project is as follows: \n* models.py - Contains the GWN class for the neural network (subclasses keras.Model) \n* data.py - Contains functions for generating, transforming, and saving synthetic gravitational wave data \n",
