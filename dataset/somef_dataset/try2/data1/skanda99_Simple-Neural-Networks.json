      "excerpt": "Simple Neural Networks (SiNN) is a library for building sequential dense neural networks. Support for standard ingredients for a neural network are provided like activation functions, loss functions, weights/bias initializers, optimizers (Adam, SGD, BGD) and some necessary operations like feed-forward and back-propagation. Any of the above can be customized according to requirement and used as just a reference to the functions are passed as arguments in most of the cases. Each of the optimizer can calculate Receiver Operating characteristics (ROC) for training set. \n",
