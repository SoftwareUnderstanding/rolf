      "excerpt": "YellowFin is an auto-tuning optimizer based on momentum SGD which requires no manual specification of learning rate and momentum. It measures the objective landscape on-the-fly and tunes momentum as well as learning rate using local quadratic approximation. \nThe implementation here can be a drop-in replacement for any optimizer in Tensorflow. It supports both minimize and apply_gradients like any tensorflow optimizer after from yellowfin import YFOptimizer. We also provide interface to manually set the learning rate schedule at every iteration for finer control (See Detailed Guideline section). \nFor more technical details, please refer to our paper YellowFin and the Art of Momentum Tuning. \nFor more usage details, please refer to the inline documentation of tuner_utils/yellowfin.py. Example usage can be found here for CIFAR and PTB. \nYellowFin is under active development. Many members of the community have kindly submitted issues and pull requests. We are incorporating fixes and smoothing things out. As a result the repository code is in flux. Please make sure you use the latest version and submit any issues you might have! \n",

      "excerpt": "Normalization: When using log probability style losses, please make sure the loss is properly normalized. In some RNN/LSTM cases, the cross_entropy need to be averaged by the number of samples in a minibatch. Sometimes, it also needs to be averaged over the number of classes and the sequence length of each sample in some Tensorflow loss functions. E.g. the cross_etropy loss here need to be normalized by the length of sequence and minibatch size. \n<!--- * **Sparsity**: Gradient norm, curvature estimations etc., when calculated with sparse gradient, are biased to larger values than the counterpart from the dense gradient on the full dataset. The bias can be illustrated using the following example: the norm of vectors (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0) and the norm of their average (0.5, 0.5). The norm of the latter is sqrt(sparsity (i.e. 0.5 here) ) * the norm of the former. The sparsity debias feature is useful when the model is very sparse, e.g. LSTM with word embedding. For non-sparse models, e.g. CNN, turning this feature off could slightly speedup. ---> \nFor PyTorch users, we implemented YellowFin PyTorch repo. \n",
