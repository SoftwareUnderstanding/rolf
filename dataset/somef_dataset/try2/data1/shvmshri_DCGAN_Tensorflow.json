      "excerpt": "In general, GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator. These two are separately a CNN architecture and are trained together. \nA ANN model which is aimed for the generation of new images. They took in input a random noise z and various convolution transpose layers are applied and it generates a image i.e. a matrices of pixel values (G(z)) .Generator never get to see the real world actual images or the training dataset of images. \nA CNN classification model used to classify whether an image passed to it is real or fake (generated by the generator).It take image from training examples x and from those generated by generator (G (z)) and predicts the probability of the image to be real (D(x)) or fake (D (G (z))). \nNow, while training the model, generator tries to increase the discriminator error as it tries to fool discriminator by improving its generated image so that they resemble real images while discriminator tries to decrease it\u2019s error by trying to judge correctly the real and the fake images. For weights of the model normally initiated ,we first train generator say for y no. of images keeping the discriminator\u2019s weights constant .Then, as generator\u2019s weight are updated ,we train discriminator keeping generator\u2019s weights to be constant for y fake and y real images and this process is then repeated for several epochs using cross entropy loss function. \n",
