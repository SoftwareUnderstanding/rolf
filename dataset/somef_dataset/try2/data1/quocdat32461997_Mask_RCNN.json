      "excerpt": "Implementation of Mask R-CNN in Tensorflow 2.0 \nMask RNN is a variant of Faster RCNN model [3]. Similar to Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN is composed 3 parts: \n* CNN Backbone - VGG or ResNet is commonly implemented as backbone for RCNN-based models in order to extract image features \n* Region Proposal Networks - a simple network composedo of Convolution layers and Fully Connected layers to propose regions (bounding boxes) for objects \n* ROIAlign - In Faster RCNN, ROI Pooling is used to apply proposed regions from RPN on feature maps from CNN Backone and to pixek max pixels for object classification. However, for masking objects, ROI Pooling leads to masking alignment due to ROI Pooling's nature. Hence, in Mask RCNN, ROI Align is in use instead \n",
