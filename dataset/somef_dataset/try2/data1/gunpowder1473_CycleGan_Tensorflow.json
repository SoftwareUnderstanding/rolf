Abandoned.\n\n- `batch_size` : the batch size of training. `1` by default. This parameter depend on GPU memory.\n\n- `lambda1` : the weight of cycleLoss and identifyLoss. `10` by default.\n\n- `lambda2` : the weight of cycleLoss and identifyLoss. `10` by default.\n\n- `ngf`: the number of filters in first convolution layer of Generator. `64` by default.\n\n- `img_size`: the input size of the GAN. `256` by default.\n\n- `USE_E`: to choose wheter use the original method or improved method. `False` by default.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTo get started with testing you can run\n```\npython GANTest.py\n```\nNotice that I used `tf.app.flags` to control the options shown below, you need to edit them in `GANTest.py`:\n\n - `input` : the location of the input image saved.\n\n - `output` : the location of the result saved.\n\n - `checkpoint` : the location of ckpt model.`../checkout` by default.\n\n - `Norm` : the norm method to use.Could be `BATCH` or `INSTANCE`.`INSTANCE` by default.\n\n - `status` : change to transfer from X to Y or from Y to X. Could be `X2Y` or `Y2X`.\n\n- `batch_size` : the batch size of testing. `1` by default. This parameter depend on GPU memory.\n\n- `ngf`: the number of filters in first convolution layer of Generator. `64` by default.\n\n- `img_size`: the input size of the GAN. `256` by default.\n\n- `USE_E`: to choose wheter use the original method or improved method. `False` by default.\n\n## Note\n\n1. Do not use `BATCH` if you do not have enough GPU memory to support a big batch, `INSTANCE` performs much better when set `batch_size` to 1.\n\n2. `USE_E` is a improvement. I found it works in style transfer for summer2winter, which is the paper's author's data set, see comparison in next sector. But have not proved on other data set.\n\n3. By default, every training step cost 0.3s on GTX1080Ti.\n\n4. Author's data set can be found in https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/\n\n## Result\n\nResults for transfer between SD dolls and Anime characters.\n\n<img src=\"./result/SD2Anime.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\">\n\n<img src=\"./result/Anime2SD.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\">\n\nResults for transfer between zebra and horse.\n\n<img src=\"./result/horsezebra.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\">\n\nResults for summer to winnter, comparing original method and improved method.\n\n<img src=\"./result/summerwinter.png\" style=\"zoom:50%\">\n\n## Problem\nIn the experiment, I found this problem without using identifyLoss. Also for using resizeConv2D(http://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/"
