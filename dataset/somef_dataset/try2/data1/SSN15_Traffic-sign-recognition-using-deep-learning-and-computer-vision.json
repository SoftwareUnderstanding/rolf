      "excerpt": "I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set: \nThe size of training set is 34799 \nThe size of test set is 12630 \nThe shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3) \nThe number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43 \nExploratory visualization of the dataset \nHere is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It pulls in a random set of 12 images and labels them with the correct names in reference with the csv file to their respective id's. \nAfter this, the dataset structure is analyzed by plotting the occurrence of each image class to get an idea of how the data is distributed. This helps in understanding the data distribution for each class and which class lacks the data. \nThe data distribution of training data is shown below: \nThe data distribution of test data is shown below: \nThe data distribution of validation data is shown below: \nThe next step is to convert the images to grayscale because the excess information only adds extra confusion into the learning process. \nThe gray scale image is shown below: \nThe grayscale image is then normalized as it helps in speeding up the training and performance metrics like resources.  \nThe normalized images is shown below in comparison with original image \nAs discussed earlier, the data distibution is not uniform. To mitigate this problem, data augmentation technique is used. \nHere in this project, data is augmented using some computer vision techniques. The randomized modifications are random alterations such as opencv affine and rotation. \n",
