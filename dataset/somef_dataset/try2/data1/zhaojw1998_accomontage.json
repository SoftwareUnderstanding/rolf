It introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization and deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality generation. Our paper [*AccoMontage: Accompaniment Arrangement via Phrase Selection and Style Transfer*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11213) is accepted by [ISMIR 2021](https://ismir2021.ismir.net/).

The files should be put to `./data files`.\n\nFor the sake of fast accompaniment arrangement, our model does not run the deep learning inference evrey time, but loads pre-inferenced transition matrix. This pre-inferenced file currently supports transition among 4, 6, and 8-bar phrases. `./util_tools/edge_weights_inference.py` can be used to compute transition matrix for other situations.\n\n",
