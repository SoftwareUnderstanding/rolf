We devise Neural Tangent Generalization Attack (NTGA), a first efficient work enabling clean-label, black-box generalization attacks against Deep Neural Networks. \nNTGA declines the generalization ability sharply, i.e. 99% -> 15%, 92% -> 33%, 99% -> 72% on MNIST, CIFAR10 and 2- class ImageNet, respectively. Please see Results or the main paper for more complete results. We also release the unlearnable MNIST, CIFAR-10, and 2-class ImageNet generated by NTGA, which can be found and downloaded in Unlearnable Datasets, and also launch learning on unlearnable data competitions.

The hyperparameter t plays an important role in NTGA, which controls when an attack will take effect during the training process of a target model. With a smaller t, the attack has a better chance to affect training before the early stop. \nBoth eps and block_size influence the effectiveness of NTGA. Larger eps leads to stronger but more distinguishable perturbations, while larger block_size results in better collaborative effect (stronger attack) in NTGA but also induces both higher time and space complexities. If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially when using --model_type cnn, please try to reduce block_size and batch_size to save memory usage. \nFor ImageNet or another custom dataset, please specify the path to the dataset in the code directly.

To use JAX with GPU, please follow [JAX's](https://github.com/google/jax/#installation) GPU installation instructions. Otherwise, install JAX on CPU by running\n\n```bash\npip install jax jaxlib --upgrade\n```\n\nOnce JAX is installed, clone and install remaining requirements by running\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/lionelmessi6410/ntga.git\ncd ntga\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you only want to examine the effectiveness of NTGAs, you can download datasets [here](#unlearnable-datasets) and evaluate with `evaluate.py` or *any* code/model you prefer. To use `evaluate.py`, you do not need to install JAX externally, instead, all dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`.\n\n",
