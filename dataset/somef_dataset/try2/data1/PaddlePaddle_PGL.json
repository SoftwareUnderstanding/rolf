      "excerpt": "We add newly graph level operators like GraphPooling and GraphNormalization for graph level predictions. \nWe relase a PGL-KE toolkit here including classical knowledge graph embedding t algorithms like TransE, TransR, RotatE. \nPaddle Graph Learning (PGL) is an efficient and flexible graph learning framework based on PaddlePaddle. \n<img src=\"./docs/source/_static/framework_of_pgl_en.png\" alt=\"The Framework of Paddle Graph Learning (PGL)\" width=\"800\"> \nThe newly released PGL supports heterogeneous graph learning on both walk based paradigm and message-passing based paradigm by providing MetaPath sampling and Message Passing mechanism on heterogeneous graph. Furthermor, The newly released PGL also support distributed graph storage and some distributed training algorithms, such as distributed deep walk and distributed graphsage. Combined with the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, we are able to support both graph representation learning models and graph neural networks, and thus our framework has a wide range of graph-based applications. \nOne of the most important benefits of graph neural networks compared to other models is the ability to use node-to-node connectivity information, but coding the communication between nodes is very cumbersome. At PGL we adopt Message Passing Paradigm similar to DGL to help to build a customize graph neural network easily. Users only need to write send and recv functions to easily implement a simple GCN. As shown in the following figure, for the first step the send function is defined on the edges of the graph, and the user can customize the send function  to send the message from the source to the target node. For the second step, the recv function  is responsible for aggregating  messages together from different sources. \n",

Therefore, in the heterogeneous graph, we need to distinguish the node types and edge types in the graph network. PGL models heterogeneous graphs that contain multiple node types and multiple edge types, and can describe complex connections between different types.\n\n",

As shown on the left, it has five neighbors, belonging to two different node types. As shown on the right of the figure above, nodes belonging to different types need to be aggregated separately during message delivery, and then merged into the final message to update the target node. On this basis, PGL supports heterogeneous graph algorithms based on message passing, such as GATNE and other algorithms.\n\n\n",
