      "excerpt": "Style GAN2 is proposed by NVIDIA and breakthrough than previous SOTA style GAN. It further improves generator image quality by using weight demodulation instead of AdaIN. It further improve latent space smoothness by PPL (perceptual path length) regularization. \nPG-GAN has been very successfully in stabilizing high-resolution image synthesis, but it causes its own characteristic atifacts. It appears to have strong location preference for details. Figure below illustrates that tooth remain unchanged when head rotates. NVIDIA believes this bug comes from progressive growing strategy. They fixed this issue by using MSG-GAN alike network. \nStyle GAN2 paper did vast body of works to compare the performance for different network (original, skip connection, residual network). Generator with skip connection and discriminator with residul network together achieve best FID and PPL performance. \nThe hyperparameters for training are: \n",

The generator create them to circumvent infomation past AdaIN: by creating a strong, localized spike that dominates the statistics to scale the scale as it likes elsewhere.  \n![Normalize_Artifact1](./Images/SG2_Artificial_1.jpg) \nIn order to fix this problem, NVIDIA reserves variance modulation and remove bias modulation of AdaIN. By proper mathmatical derivation, the revised network can be treated as weight demodulation.
