DGL-KE and DGL-LifeSci, two packages for knowledge graph embedding and chemi- and bio-informatics respectively, have graduated as standalone packages and can be installed by pip and conda. The new release provides full support of graph sampling on heterogeneous graphs, with multi-GPU acceleration. See our new feature walkthrough and release note. \n03/02/2020: Check out this cool paper: Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks!  It includes a DGL-based benchmark framework for novel medium-scale graph datasets, covering mathematical modeling, computer vision, chemistry and combinatorial problems.  See repo here. \nA data scientist may want to apply a pre-trained model to your data right away. For this you can use DGL's Application packages, formally Model Zoo. Application packages are developed for domain applications, as is the case for DGL-LifeScience. We will soon add model zoo for knowledge graph embedding learning and recommender systems.
