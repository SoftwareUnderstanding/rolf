      "excerpt": "![](illustration.png)\n\nEfficient attention is an attention mechanism that substantially optimizes the memory and computational efficiency while retaining **exactly** the same expressive power as the conventional dot-product attention. The illustration above compares the two types of attention. The efficient attention module is a drop-in replacement for the non-local module ([Wang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971)), while it:\n\n- uses less resources to achieve the same accuracy;\n- achieves higher accuracy with the same resource constraints (by allowing more insertions); and\n- is applicable in domains and models where the non-local module is not (due to resource constraints).\n\n",
