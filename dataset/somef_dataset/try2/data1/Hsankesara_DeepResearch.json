It contains the tutorial about the papers as well as their codes. The idea is that Artificial Intelligence is not the realm of researchers only. Even a beginner must be able to run a model without going through the whole trouble using complex libraries and get a feel of it. \n|Paper|Code|Tutorial|Any Other links| \n",
