Replace words by a filler token with given probability (default is 0.1)\n3. Swap words up to a certain range (default range is 3)\n\nThe default parameters are to reproduce [Edunov et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09381) experiments but you can play with them and maybe find better values\n\nExample of simple usage\n```sh\npython add_noise.py data/example --progress\n```\nExample of complete usage\n```sh\npython add_noise.py data/example --delete_probability 0.9 --replace_probability 0.9  --filler_token 'MASK' --permutation_range 3\n```\n\n**Important Note**\n\nIf you are using a subword tool such as SentencePiece after adding noise to your corpus, notice that your replacement token (which is ``'BLANK'`` by default) might be segmented into somthing like ``'\u2581B LAN K'``\n\nI recommend to make a pass on your corpus to correct it: (adapt it to your token and segmentation)\n```sh\nsed -i 's/\u2581B LAN K/\u2581BLANK/g' yourtextfile\n```\n\n",
