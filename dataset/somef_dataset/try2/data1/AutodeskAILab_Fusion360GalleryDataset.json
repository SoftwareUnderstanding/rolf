The dataset is produced from designs submitted by users of the CAD package Autodesk Fusion 360 to the Autodesk Online Gallery. The dataset provides valuable data for learning how people design, including sequential CAD design data, designs segmented by modeling operation, and assemblies containing hierarchy and joint connectivity information. \nFrom the approximately 20,000 designs available we derive several datasets focused on specific areas of research. Currently the following data subsets are available, with more to be released on an ongoing basis. \n",
