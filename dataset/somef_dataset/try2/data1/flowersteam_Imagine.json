M., Moulin-Frier, C., Dominey, P. F., & Oudeyer, P. Y. (2020). Language as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven Exploration, Part of Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (NeurIPS 2020). \nLearning open-ended repertoire of skills requires agents that autonomously explore their environments. To do so, they need to self-organize their exploration by generating and selecting their goals (IMGEP). In this framework, how can agents make creative discoveries? \nIn this paper, we propose to equip agents with language grounding capabilities in order to represent goals as language. We then leverage language compositionality and systematic generalization as a means to perform out-of-distribution goal generation. \n",
