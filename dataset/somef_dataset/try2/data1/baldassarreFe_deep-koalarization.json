Inspired by these, we propose a model which combines a deep Convolutional Neural Network trained from scratch with high-level features extracted from the Inception-ResNet-v2 pre-trained model. Thanks to its fully convolutional architecture, our encoder-decoder model can process images of any size and aspect ratio. Other than presenting the training results, we assess the \"public acceptance\" of the generated images by means of a user study. Finally, we present a carousel of applications on different types of images, such as historical photographs. \n",
