We also provide implementation of a lot of recent papers, which is of independent interests. The papers including VEGAN, ALI, ALICE. We also try some combination of these methods while the most direct competitor of our method is ALI. \nWarning: the code is still under development. If you have any problem with the code, please send an email to chongxuanli1991@gmail.com. Any feedback will be appreciated! \nWe thank the authors of wgan-gp for providing their code. Our code is widely adapted from their repositories. \n",
