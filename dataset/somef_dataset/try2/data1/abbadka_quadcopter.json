The idea behind this project is to teach a simulated quadcopter how to perform some activities. I have chosen to teach it two tasks: Take off and maintain position (or hover). \nThe agent is based on the theory in the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), specifically the concepts from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971.
