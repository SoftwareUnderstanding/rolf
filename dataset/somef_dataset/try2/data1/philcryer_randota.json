To use this script, follow the same steps below, skipping the \"Glitch your avatar\" section.\n\n## Idea3 - moonphase icon in profile description\n\nThis commited code changes the user's description to an icon representing the current moon phase. I'd like to expand on this to update the username to the name of the phase of the mooon. As with the last script, to use this, skip the \"Glitch your avatar\" section - and remind me to redo this README.md to account for all the different scripts soon!\n\n## Steps\n\n### Get the code\n\nClone the git repo and start to configure your environment\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/philcryer/randota.git\ncd randota\nrm -rf images/glitched/*\ncp config.json.dist config.json\n```\n\n### Install requirements\n\nFor Debian GNU/Linux, or any Ubuntu derivatives:\n\n```\nsudo apt install python3-pip\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFor Arch Linux, or derivatives:\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S python-pip\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Create a Twitter app\n\nThe first step you should take is to create a new Twitter App so you can get permissions to update your user's avatar. While there are many howtos out there, this one is complete and should get you going; [How to create a Twitter application](https://docs.inboundnow.com/guide/create-twitter-application/)\n\nOnce you get to \"8. Make a note of your OAuth Settings\", be sure and save the Consumer Key, Consumer secret, Access token and Access token secret, defining each of the values in your newly created `config.json` file\n\n### Glitch your avatar\n\nTo glitch your avatar, play on here, otherwise if you just want to use standard avatars and rotate between them, jump to the next section\n\n1) save your avatar locally\n2) hit [jpg-glitch](https://snorpey.github.io/jpg-glitch/), upload your avatar, glitch it as much as you want, or just choose the 'random' option\n3) save the file into a directory `images/glitched`\n4) repeat as many times as you'd like to increase your randomness\n\n\n### Run it\n\nTo run `glitchedavatar.py`:\n\n```\npython3 glitchedavatar.py\n```\n\nor, to run `getthisperson.py`:\n\n```\npython3 getthisperson.py\n```\n\nView the hilarity or disappointment at twitter.com/<your_username>\n\n### Automate it\n\nAdd a new line to your user's crontab, fill out the path to where your code is\n\nTo automate `glitchedavatar.py`:\n\n```\n0 * * * *    cd ${HOME"
