Edit the folder paths in the code:\n    a. training: Folder containing images for training. For this project 800 images from DIV2K dataset were used\n    b. testing: FOlder containing images to be tested/used for super resolution\n    c. logs: Folder to save log\n    d. results\n    e: models: to save weights\n3. Training can be avoided by using the pretrained weights. Download the pretrained weights from repository and make a copy in Google drive. Update the path in Testing path.\n\nFollowing is the result of training the network on 800 images and 30,000 Epochs. The results can be substantially improved using more images (~5000"
