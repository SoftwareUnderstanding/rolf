      "excerpt": "This repository contains a image colorization system using Convolutional Neural nets. The fundamental idea is to predict A and B channels of LAB space images provided the L channels. CIE Lab or sometimes abbreviated as simply \"Lab\" color space expresses color as three numerical values, L for the lightness and a and b for the green\u2013red and blue\u2013yellow color components. For further details of the color space kindly refer to the following link: \n",

Though simple to implement, a downside of this Loss function is that the images lose its vibrancy in many cases. \n",
