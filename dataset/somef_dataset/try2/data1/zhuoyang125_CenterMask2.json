Run it with:\n```\npython custom_demo.py --config_file configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml --input input1.jpg input2.jpg --output results/ --confidence_threshold 0.6 --weights model_final.pth\n```\n\nFor video inference, replace --input files with --video video.mp4, and --output is name of output video saved in current dir. \n\nIf no --output given, instances are shown in cv2 window\n\n",
