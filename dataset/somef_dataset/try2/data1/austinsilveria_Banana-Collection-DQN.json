Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.   \nThe state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to: \n",
