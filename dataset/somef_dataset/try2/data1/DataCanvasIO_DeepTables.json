      "excerpt": "Dear folks, we are opening several precious positions based in Beijing both for professionals and interns avid in AutoML/NAS, please send your resume/cv to yangjian@zetyun.com. (Application deadline: TBD.) \nDeepTables(DT) is a easy-to-use toolkit that enables deep learning to unleash great power on tabular data. \nMLP (also known as Fully-connected neural networks) have been shown inefficient in learning distribution representation. The \"add\" operations of the perceptron layer have been proven poor performance to exploring multiplicative feature interactions. In most cases, manual feature engineering is necessary and this work requires extensive domain knowledge and very cumbersome. How learning feature interactions efficiently in neural networks becomes the most important problem. \nVarious models have been proposed to CTR prediction and continue to outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches to the late years. Well-known examples include FM, DeepFM, Wide&Deep, DCN, PNN, etc. These models can also provide good performance on tabular data under reasonable utilization. \nDT aims to utilize the latest research findings to provide users with an end-to-end toolkit on tabular data. \n",
