Follow the instructions to\n  build and install it. You should build from source because we use a custom user op implemented\n  in C++.\n\n  2. In the folder `rotate_op/` you will find three files: `BUILD`, `rotate.cc` and `rotate_grad.cc`.\n  These are user operations that we wrote. Copy them into `tensorflow/tensorflow/core/user_ops`.\n  Then run the following command `bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/core/user_ops:rotate.so` in that directory.\n  This generates the `.so` file that will be loaded by `ntm.py`. If you did not clone tensorflow\n  into the root folder of this project as instructed, please modify the path in `ntm.py` accordingly.\n  \n  3. To execute the copy task, run `python copy_task.py`.\n  \n",
