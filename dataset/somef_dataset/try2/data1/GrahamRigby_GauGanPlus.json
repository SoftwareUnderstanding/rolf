      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07291, to \nadapt better to smaller datasets. I introduce a MultiDiscriminator model combining the a single layer discriminator used in \nGauGan as well as another discriminator similar to the one used from Pix2Pix's PatchGan. The later discriminator does not \nconcatenate the image  and semantic input map, it rather just uses images output from the Generator. This resulted in better \nresults than using an additional L1Loss regularizer in our Generator loss function. And it was able to better adapt to unseen Data.\nI also added some noise sampled from a Gaussian to the input images before being fed into the VAE Image Encoder due to the small\ndataset I was working with. \n\n\n![](EvalImages/test_map1.png"
