This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria. \n",

More than 1 million adults are hospitalized with pneumonia and around 50,000 die from the disease every \nyear in the US alone. The high prevalence of pneumonia makes it a good candidate for the development of a deep learning application for two reasons: 1) Data availability in a high enough quantity for training deep learning models for image classification 2) Opportunity for clinical aid by providing higher accuracy image reads of a difficult-to-diagnose disease and/or reduce clinical burnout by performing automated reads of very common scans.  \nThe diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays is difficult for several reasons:  \n1. The appearance of pneumonia in a chest X-ray can be very vague depending on the stage of the infection \n",

Alternatively, you can download the data from the kaggle website and run it locally. You are STRONGLY recommended to complete the project using the Udacity workspace since the data is huge, and you will need GPU to accelerate the training process. \nThere are 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients in this dataset.  The disease labels were created using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine the associated radiological reports. The labels include 14 common thoracic pathologies:  \n",
