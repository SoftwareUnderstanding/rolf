      "excerpt": "This repository holds the final project deliverable for UVics ECE 471 class. This project is one of many implementations of the paper Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network by Christian Ledig, et al. \nOur approach was to imitate the implementation of this paper, and to see its significance to real-world noise. We created our own dataset for testing our theory that the results of the GAN was undoing the downsampling, ie. undoing the gaussian noise. \nUnfortunately due to the time constraint from other classes and the magnitude of this project, the model has a flaw which makes the network not converge towards meaningful results. This is possibly due to normalization problems, or a problem with the custom convolution as PyTorch does not have an option for 'same' padding. It is also possible that we are misinterpreting the Content Loss (VGG19 network). \nOverall this was a great learning experience and I personally hope to recreate/modify this in the future. \n",
