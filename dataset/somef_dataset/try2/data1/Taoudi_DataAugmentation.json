      "excerpt": "Battling the unblananced dataset problem using different data augmentation methods \nThe network models in the project use the area under the ROC curve (AUC)[1] as a metric for assessing prediction performance. Overall accuracy is not a suitable metric as it does not give a good overview of seperation power for unbalanced datasets[2]. AUC on the other hand uses recall and precision, meaning it takes advantage of the confusion matrix[2] of the model and will thus give a more suitable measurement for models working on imbalanced datasets. \nModel Selection (Cross Validation) using AutoKeras[5] and some popular network models - Best performer: LENET 300 \n",
