We implemented our unsupervised pre-training objectives using these token preprocessors. \nWe provide many predefined preprocessors in t5.data.preprocessors, but you may also define your own. \nThe SentencePiece model is used to tokenize the input strings and decode the output tokens. You can create your own model with the google/sentencepiece library, or use our default one at t5.data.DEFAULT_SPM_PATH. \nThe metric function returns a score given the target and prediction from the model. You may also define a postprocess function to convert the target and prediction text to another format before calling the metric. We provide some predefined metrics in t5.evaluation.metrics. \nFinally, t5.data contains a Mixture class that can be instantiated to combine multiple Task datasets for multi-task training using various functions for specifying the mixture rates. \nt5.evaluation contains two core components: a module for specifying metrics to be used during evaluation and utilities for applying these metrics at evaluation time. \nt5.models contains shims for connecting T5 Tasks and Mixtures to a model implementation for training, evaluation, and inference. Currently the only available shim is to the [Mesh TensorFlow Transformer][mtft], which enables both data and model parallelism for training massive Transformer models. It also includes a binary for launching the model along with [gin config][gin] files for setting various hyperparameters. \n",

After preparation is complete, the dataset is cached to your local storage to avoid this overhead in future runs.  If working in the cloud, we recommend you set the --t5_tfds_data_dir flag to point to a persistent storage location, such as a [GCS bucket][gcs]. This is a requirement when training on TPU. \nNote:The [C4][c4] dataset we created for unsupervised pre-training is available in TensorFlow Datasets, but it requires a significant amount of bandwith for downloading the raw [Common Crawl][cc] scrapes and compute for its preparation. We suggest you take advantage of the [Apache Beam][beam] support in TFDS, which enables distributed preprocessing of the dataset and can be run on [Google Cloud Dataflow][gcd].
