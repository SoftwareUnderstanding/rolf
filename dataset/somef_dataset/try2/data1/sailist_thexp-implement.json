That's the only thing you need to do before running some scripts.  \n\nAnd, find the script in `trainers/` and directly run it.\n\nFor example, if you want to reproduce the result of fixmatch, you can find it in `trainers/semisupervised/fixmatch.py`, and run it by using the code below:\n```\npython trainers/semisupervised/fixmatch.py\n\n#: or\ncd trainers/semisupervised\npython fixmatch.py\n``` \n\n> the working directory will be changed automaticaly, so you just need to run it.\n\n",
