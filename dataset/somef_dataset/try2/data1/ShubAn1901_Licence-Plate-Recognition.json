      "excerpt": "In the modern world where crimes are increasing at a phenomenal rate we need a strong system to act against the same. We need a system that is able to capture and store the license plate of a vehicle in case of a crime. \nOur aim is License Plate Detection and Recognition.  \nWe realized our aim through RPNet. It consists of two parts. First the object detection part, which detects the license plate and forms a bounding box around it. Then we use OCR on these detected license plates to extract the alphabets and digits on the license plates. This is done end-to-end. We describe our idea in detail in the upcoming 'Approach' section. \nWe use the CCPD dataset, the largest openly available dataset of license plate images (more than 250,000 images). It provides a large and varied dataset for testing our network and effectively generalizing the results obtained. Most other license plate datasets are very small (4000 - 10000 images) and are not adequate to train such an End-to-End network. \nWe divide our problem into two fundamental parts \n",

      "excerpt": "- Recognising the characters of the license plate \nA common way of doing the above, as used in many papers, is having a separate network, typically like YOLO, SSD or even RCNN to detect license plates in an image and predict accurate bounding boxes around these. These plate detectors are trained first on large databases like ImageNet and then fine-tuned for detecting boxes. Then, a separate character recognition net is trained on only the bounding boxes extracted from the image. \nWe, instead use an End-to-End training based network to perform both the Box detection, and number plate prediction. We use an architecture called the RPNet, proposed in an ECCV 2018 paper to detect license plates and recognise their characters. It involves: \n - An equivalent to the old \"Box detectors\" networks made of 2D convolutional layers, which in addition to detecting the license plate location also gets useful features for character recognition. \n- 7 classifiers for extracting the 7 digits in license plate. They use cross linkages from various deeper convolutional layers for their prediction, in addition to the usual bounding box coordinates. The cross linkages help in recognition of smaller and bigger plates, which is important in generalizing our results as vehicles may be very near or very far away from the camera. \nWe train our model End-to End, unlike the older approaches and use our large CCPD dataset for it. Both the classification and the box detection loss are used for it. Training the \"box detector CNN\" too using the 'classification loss + box detector loss' helps in making the convolutional features more useful in recognition of characters. \nThe Block Digram in straightforward terms is shown below: \nIn our quest to achieve better recognition and understand the network better, we conducted quite a few experiments, the most important of which are as mentioned- \n",
