      "excerpt": "ClaRAN - Classifying Radio Galaxies Automatically with Neural Networks \nAs an upgrade of the ClaRAN v0.1, ClaRAN v0.2 is based on the awesome Tensorpack project, which is likely the best-performing open source TensorFlow reimplementation of Faster R-CNN. Moreover, Tensorpack has integrated the Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection (FPN). It also supports instance segmentation based on Mask R-CNN, although ClaRAN v0.2 currently does not support source segmentation. \nIn summary, ClaRAN v0.2 includes the following new features: \n+ The default \"backbone\" network is now ResNet50. \n",
