      "excerpt": "This repository will contain the codes and information from my Image Colorization project using PyTorch.  \nThe purpose of the notebook is to let myself be familiar with the process of training and testing a DL model. Image colorization was chosen as the topic due to the large amount of resources available online. Much of the codes were taken from an article here: https://towardsdatascience.com/colorizing-black-white-images-with-u-net-and-conditional-gan-a-tutorial-81b2df111cd8, with slight modifications made to the model itself. A different dataset was used and the way the data was extracted, transformed and loaded varies from the article too. Other resources referenced in the notebook include the papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511, and https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004.  \n",
