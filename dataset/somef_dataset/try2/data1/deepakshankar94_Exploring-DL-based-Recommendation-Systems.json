We try to optimize our recommendation system to minimize the difference in our prediction of users\u2019 rating and their real preference. Since the dataset we use is relatively large, we are also interested in knowing how well these algorithms scale with the data size. More detailed objective and evaluation of individual system are explained in the report.\n\n\n",
