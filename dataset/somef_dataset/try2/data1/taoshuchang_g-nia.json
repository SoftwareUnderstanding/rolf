      "excerpt": "In this paper, we focus on an extremely limited scenario of **single node injection evasion attack,** i.e., the attacker is only allowed to inject one single node during the test phase to hurt GNN\u2019s performance. Single node injection evasion attack has the advantages of being difficult to detect and low in cost. Taking social networks as an example, it is very difficult for both the detection system and the user to detect the addition of one single malicious follower, especially compared with existing node injection methods which lead to a sudden emergence of multiple followers.\n\n<img src=\"./imgs/Example.png\" />\n\n\n\n\n",
