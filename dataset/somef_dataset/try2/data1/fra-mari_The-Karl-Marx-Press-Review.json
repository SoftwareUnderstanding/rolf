      "excerpt": "A website to visualise a NLP project on text generation with GPT-2 \nThis website has been developed with Python and Flask to provide a visualisation of a project on text generation with GPT-2. Trained on 8 million webpages, GPT-2 was released in 2019 for generating high-quality short texts based on a few words provided as an initial input.  \nFor this project, I decided to fine-tune the GPT-2, that is to make it especially sensitive to a certain vocabulary or style, so as to reproduce those features while generating text. To achieve this goal and to better be able to assess its results, I first looked for a corpus of texts featuring a very colourful, if homogenous, rhetoric to retrain the GPT-2 on. My choice eventually fell on the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which I scraped from the website of the Marx Engels Archive. Moreover, to observe the outcome of \u201cMarxist\u201d textual generation on a variety of topics, I thought it could be interesting to provide inputs for the GPT-2 from a newspaper. Hence the idea of this peculiar press review, which is updated with the latest news of The Guardian. \n",

      "excerpt": "The model is fine-tuned by means of aitextgen, a Python library developed by Max Woolf. Aitextgen leverages PyTorch to retrain the 124 M version of GPT-2 using the dataset provided by the user.  \nThe webapp cyclically collects articles from The Guardian\u2019s API and uses the language model to generate \u201cMarxist comments\u201d based on them. I also implemented some basic sentiment analysis on the generated comments using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). All these data are eventually stored in the SQL database. \nThe website also features a function for directly interacting with the model. The Marxist GPT-2 is not always very intelligent, however it is pretty opinionated one, and it is always fun to talk to it! \ud83d\ude09    \n",
