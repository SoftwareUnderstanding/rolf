      "excerpt": "This work presents a simple method for self-constructing neural networks via random mutation. It operates in a similar manner to NEAT combined with network pruning; however, changes do not occur on the scale of generations with population search, rather the neural topology is actively modified during the agent's lifetime from experience by deciding whether to accept random mutations.  \nThe algorithm is as follows: \n(1) Initialize and evaluate a network of input and output neurons with no connections and set as current best, \\ \n",
