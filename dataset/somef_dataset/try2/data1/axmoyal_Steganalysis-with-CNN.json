      "excerpt": "I completed this project from scratch with Guillermo Bescos and Lucas Soffer for the course CS231N (\"Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition\") at Stanford University. \nSteganography is the science of hiding a message into an ordinary file. In recent years criminals and terrorists have used steganography to hide encrypted messages within ordinary images. What seems like a simple image of a cat on the internet could actually contain a secret message or even a huge file that only a specific individual could ever retrieve. This is why law enforcement are now researching steganalysis: the study of detecting steganography. \nIn this project we would like to use the Kaggle\\cite{kaggle} dataset called \"ALASKA2 image Steganalysis\" where the task is to classify images which hide an encoded message. The training set consists of 75k images and for each image, an altered version with each of 3 different  undisclosed encoding algorithms (a total of 300k images). Our goal is to use deep learning architectures such as ResNet and SRnet to classify these images. We will also consider the impact of using discrete fourier transforms instead of RGB inputs. \n-Arguments for the neural networks are defined in args.json. They are transformed in dictionnaries and saved with te file args.py.  \n-Dataloaders are created in dataload.py. There are different options depending on if we want to put the images without alteration and with alteration in the same batch.  \n",
