      "excerpt": "CNN is a technique introduced by Gatys et al. (2015) in their paper 'Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Network'. The algotithm allows us to separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. In another words, it is capable of extracting content information from a image and then extract style information from a famous artwork, then combine them together to produce a new image that possesses the content of the photo and the appearance of a given artwork. The key idea backed up this algorithm is to optimise an image with the objective of matching desired CNN feature distributions, which involves both the photo's content information and the artwork's style information. The team realizes the function that image style transfer mainly by cnn_paint_style function from the website about \"Painting Like Van Gogh with Convolutional Neural Networks\"(2016).<br> \n",

One important thing to be notified here is that only the 'jpg','jpeg','png','bmp' type of file can be uploaded, if the user try to upload one file other than these specified four or no file is selected, there will be a error message box popping up with the massage shown as \"Please try to upload a 'jpg','jpeg','png','bmp' file.\". <br> \n",

Following this, use the code `python3.6 gui_main_page.py` to run the project, then the main gui will appear.
