      "excerpt": "Siamese networks have drawn great attention in visual tracking because of their balanced accuracy and speed.  However, the backbone network utilized in these trackers is still the classical AlexNet, which does not fully take advantage of the capability of modern deep neural networks. \r\n  \r\nOur proposals improve the performances of fully convolutional siamese trackers by,\r\n1) introducing CIR and CIR-D units to unveil the power of deeper and wider networks like [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [Inceptipon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842); \r\n2) designing backbone networks according to the analysis on internal network factors (e.g. receptive field, stride, output feature size), which affect tracking performances.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"demo/vis.gif\" width=\"800px\" />\r\n  <!-- <p>Example SiamFC, SiamRPN and SiamMask outputs.</p> -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- :tada::tada: **Highlight !!**\r\nSiamese tracker is severely sensitive to hyper-parameter, which is a common sense in tracking field. Although significant progresses have been made in some works, the result is hard to reproduce. In this case, we provide a [parameter tuning toolkit]() to make our model being reproduced easily. We hope our efforts and supplies will be helpful to your work. -->\r\n\r\n",
