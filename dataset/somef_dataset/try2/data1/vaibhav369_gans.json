      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661\nWe use a very simple gan network to mimic a random mathematical distribution created using numpy.\n\n### fashion-mnist\nThis project generates images which mimic the distribution of images in the popular fashion-mnist dataset\n\n### conditional-gan\nWhereas the previous project generated images from the sample space of fashion-mnist dataset, we had no control over what image we wanted to generate. This GAN accepts a parameter, which can be used to generate a specific type of image, say (image of a sandal"
