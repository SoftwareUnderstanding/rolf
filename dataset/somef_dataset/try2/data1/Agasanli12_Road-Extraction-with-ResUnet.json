It was adopted by researchers for multiple applications such as polyp segmentation, brain tumour segmentation, human image segmentation, and many more.  \nRESUNET is a fully convolutional neural network that is designed to get high performance with fewer parameters. It is an improvement over the existing UNET architecture. RESUNET takes the advantage of both the UNET architecture and the Deep Residual Learning. \n",

Each image has 1200 X 600 pixels where left half part of those images represent satellite images. C++ files in \"splitter\" folder was used to split images two equal parts which must have 600 X 600 pixels for each image. After splitting process, C++ files in \"thresholder\" folder was used to create masks for training process. Mask is just binarized version of input images where value of pixels greater than 250 must be mapped to 255 and other pixels must be mapped to 0. Jupyter file Format_Dataset.ipynb was used to change the size of input images and masks which must have 256 X 256 pixels for U-net model. ... \n",
