Contributed by authors of a (currently unpublished) paper.\r\n* A property `has_loss` is added to each gate, in order to identify whether balance loss should be collected.\r\n\r\n### Megatron-LM support\r\n\r\n* Experts are partitioned by tensor model parallelism in `mp_group`, instead of expert parallelism.\r\n* Support arbitrary customized gate in `MegatronMLP`.\r\n* Move the patches to a stand-alone file.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n* Move util functions into `test_ddp.py`.\r\n",
