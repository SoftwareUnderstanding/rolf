      "excerpt": "A landmark-driven method on Facial Expression Recognition (FER). The module of FER is based on the SCN backbone proposed by the paper \"Suppressing Uncertainties for Large-Scale Facial Expression Recognition\". \nNote that the module of FER is not the official implementation. All of the code can be only used for research purposes. \nThe source code, pretrained model and some data are released. \nWe find that some deep-learning methods in the area of FER need to use the pretrained network module which is pretrained on other tasks, such as facial recognition. So we plan to implement a method to avoid employing such a pretrained model. \nNowadays, the facial landmark detection algorithms are very robust and efficient. Then we combine two different tasks into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the facial landmark improves the accuracy of FER. \n",
