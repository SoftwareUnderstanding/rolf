We have re-organized all the codes and frameworks. \r\n\r\n**Highlights**\r\n- We use [*Dynamic Instantiation*](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/docs/DesignConvention.md#Dynamic-Instantiation) for creating datasets, architectures, and models. So it is easier and more friendly to develop your own algorithms. \r\n- We provide [richer documents](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/tree/master/docs). At the same time, we also provide a Chinese version (\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6587\u6863\u8bf4\u660e).\r\n- We provide more [pre-trained models, training examples](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR/blob/master/docs/ModelZoo.md). We also upload the training process and curves to [wandb](https://app.wandb.ai/xintao/basicsr).\r\n- Currently, it supports: \r\n    - Training: EDSR, EDVR, ESRGAN, SRResNet, SRGAN\r\n    - Testing: DUF, EDSR, EDVR, ESRGAN, RCAN, SRResNt, SRGAN, and TOF.\r\n- We also mirror this codebase to *[Gitee\u7801\u4e91](https://gitee.com/xinntao/BasicSR)* for easy access of Chinese users. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSorry that this version of BasicSR is not compatible with the previous versions. \r\n\r\nWe will add more features to this codebase. And welcome contribute, and report bugs! \ud83d\ude06 ",
