You are fed up with Korean beers that you\u2019ve been drinking for years. Just then, you notice that there are lots of imported beers that you\u2019ve never drank before. There are too many choices and it\u2019s even hard to read the label because it\u2019s written in foreign language. At the time you run the BARS app and take some photos of those beers and upload it. Now, You have all the info about those beers which will make you a smart consumer. \n",
