Then, we downsample the high-resolution representations by a 2-strided 3x3 convolution outputting 256 channels and add them to the representations of the second-high-resolution representations. This process is repeated two times to get 1024 channels over the small resolution. Last, we transform 1024 channels to 2048 channels through a 1x1 convolution, followed by a global average pooling operation. The output 2048-dimensional representation is fed into the classifier. \n",
