      "excerpt": "Python/PyTorch implementation of the discovery of collective variables (CV) in atomistic systems. \nExtending spatio-temporal scale limitations of models for complex atomistic systems considered in biochemistry and materials science necessitates the development of enhanced sampling methods. The potential acceleration in exploring the configurational space by enhanced sampling methods depends on the choice of collective variables (CVs). This software implements the discovery of CVs as a Bayesian inference problem and considers CVs as hidden generators of the full-atomistic trajectory. The ability to generate samples of the fine-scale atomistic configurations using limited training data allows to compute estimates of observables as well as our probabilistic confidence on them. The formulation is based on emerging methodological advances in machine learning and variational inference. The discovered CVs are related to physicochemical properties which are essential for understanding mechanisms especially in unexplored complex systems. We provide a quantitative assessment of the CVs in terms of their predictive ability for alanine dipeptide (ALA-2) and ALA-15 peptide. \nResults of the following publication are based on this implementation: Predictive Collective Variable Discovery with Deep Bayesian Models. \nThe datasets for ALA-2 and ALA-15 are located in the subfolders ./data_peptide/ala-2/. and ./data_peptide/ala-15/., \n",

With the --dataset option one is able to choose N, the amount of samples considered for training the model and the peptide (i.e. ALA-2 or ALA-15).
