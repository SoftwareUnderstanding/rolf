      "excerpt": "CycleGAN is a method used to create neural networks that can translate from one domain to another. It consists of four neural networks: two generators than transform from one domain into the other and two discriminators that try to decide between real images and fake ones. \nDiscriminator Architecture: This is composed of several convolutional layers with stride two, with a final fully connected layer - which is supposed to be a convolution that outputs a single number but they work out to the same thing. This is sometimes known as a patch net. \n",
