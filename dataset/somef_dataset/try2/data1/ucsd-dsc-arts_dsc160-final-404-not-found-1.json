      "excerpt": "Pop culture is filled with symbolic representations. One of the most significant and powerful representations is the imagery of superheroes. If you dissect the notion of prevalent superheroes, it is not difficult to notice that most of them are white males with extreme gender characteristics, such as masculinity. This single-handed over-representation brings us to the topic of this art project. To reconstruct the gender characteristics of superheroes and diversify them, in this art project, we aim to recreate faces of superheroes in Frida Kahlo's perspective, who was an artist famous for exploring sexuality, gender and Politics in her paintings.  \nTo collect data, we firstly found this dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/vibster2397/superheroes. Since the model we use will requires thousands of pictures, we decided to use web scraping to collect superheros of both Marvel and D.C. universes from https://www.superherodb.com/characters/ and Frida Kalho's portraits from https://www.frida-kahlo-foundation.org/. Firstly, we will use our heroes datasets as our training data to recreate new superhero faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network with PyTorch. After finishing recreating new faces, we will use CNN and Gram Matrix to style transfer superheroes faces in a Frida Kahlo style, by which we aim to emphasize femininity and lessen the masculinity.If things go as we plan, we will recreate gender-neutral style superheros and present them sequentially in a video in which we showed how they are created.  \nPossible challenges might arise in creating visually pleasant, high resolution portraits since we are new to this area and have no actual experience in applying what we learned in real world problems. Other challenges might include the detailed criteria of femininity. To expand on the scope of classroom topics, we recreate faces of humans instead of animals and combine the techniques of DCGAN with CNN.  \nWe are interested in this topic primarily because we noticed that superheros movies were subconsciously promoting toxic masculinity and the under-representation of feminine qualities. Judith Butler once said gender was socially constructed. To rephrase her saying, sex is a biological characteristic, while gender is socially constructed. In this art project, we aim to reconstruct the gender notions of superheroes. We want to redefine the faces of superheros through combining the masculinity within old superheros with the fluidity of gender in Kahlo' paintings to create gender-neutral superheros.  \n",

In the video, we can see that the generated result improves over the time. However, about one minute into the video, we can see that there are lots of duplicated resulting images. In order to have satisfying results from DCGAN, we acquire a database much larger than 3000 images. However, our database is limited as the number of heroes in comics are limited. To achieve better results, we duplicated the data base three times. It could be the reason that we have similar resulting images. Among the resulting faces we got, there are many faces that are recognizable and gender neutral. This result on the top right is like an alien version of Valkyrie. However, it also contains masculinity. This is clearly a strong gender-neutral superheroes. \nWe also have the results after using style transfer. The resulting images of gender neutral heroes are more recognizable comparing to results from DCGAN. However, the resulting image shares great similarity with the original images. It is more like apply frida image as a filter on top of the hero images. We do not really see the application of gender neutral process in the resulting images.  \nWe compiled the generated 500 pictures of epochs into a video and the foloowing video is the result: \nThese are the generated superheros from the 500 epochs we generated using DCGAN:                                                        \n",

      "excerpt": "This is one of the result from the 451th epoch in DCGAN process, which contains some human faces: \nThese are the style-transferred results: \nWe attempted to recreate new superheroes with our own datasets of superheroes in which male and female superheroes maintain an approximate equal ratio of male and female. In the new images, the images are not very clear; but the generated superheroes\u2019 gender characteristics are weakened, yet they still showed some kind of physical sex characteristics such as really strong jaw lines, one of the representations of masculinity. After style transferring them, we saw that their masculinity was slightly weakened, but overall there were no big changes in regards to strong physical characteristics. \nOur attempt to recreate new superheroes are based on our observation of the over-represented toxic masculinity and an unbalanced gender representation and our aspiration to change this current situation. Our datasets include almost all kinds of superheroes ever created in these two major comic companies and an overall more balanced gender ratio, which makes our dataset comparatively diverse. Then we style-transferred them with Frida Kahlo\u2019 paintings. We chose her because her paintings are famous for their gender fluidity and discovery of sexualities; also, they reflect Kahlo\u2019s inner world that constantly encompasses her own battle with her accidents, heartbreak with her loved one, and her mental illness; the gender fluidity and fragility, we believed can weaken the strong masculinity in the current super heroes representations. Our computational approach is based on the understanding of machine learning models, which are different from traditional artistic production methods since they are usually created by humans. Our attempts of recreating new superheroes from a diverse superheroes pool are inspired by the Feminism movement and Black Lives Matter movement since both of them call for social justice that is based on aspiration for more equality and less bias, which was represented as a form of over representation of one single social group, white males especially, and under representation of other social groups.  \nSince our generated images do not have high resolution and clear faces, our future directions can be adopting a new model, such as styleGAN, just as Professor Twomey himself suggested, and conduct latent search using Frida Kahlo\u2019s paintings instead of simple style-transferring them, since latent search can better apply the characteristics of images to others. \nProvide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished. \n",
