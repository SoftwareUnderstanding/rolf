If individuals can be easily distinguished visually (i.e., they have differently colored bodies or are marked in some way), then multiple individuals can simply be labeled with separate keypoints (head1, tail1, head2, tail2, etc.). Otherwise DeepPoseKit can be extended to multiple individuals by first localizing, tracking, and cropping individuals with additional software such as idtracker.ai, pinpoint, or Tracktor. \nLocalization (without tracking) can also be achieved with deep learning software like keras-retinanet, the Tensorflow Object Detection API, or MatterPort's Mask R-CNN. \nCheck out our paper to find out more. \n",

For example, training and saving a model requires only a few lines of code:\n```python\nfrom deepposekit.io import DataGenerator, TrainingGenerator\nfrom deepposekit.models import StackedDenseNet\n\ndata_generator = DataGenerator('/path/to/annotation_data.h5')\ntrain_generator = TrainingGenerator(data_generator)\nmodel = StackedDenseNet(train_generator)\nmodel.fit(batch_size=16, n_workers=8)\nmodel.save('/path/to/saved_model.h5')\n```\nLoading a trained model and running predictions on new data is also straightforward. For example, running predictions on a new video:\n```python\nfrom deepposekit.models import load_model\nfrom deepposekit.io import VideoReader\n\nmodel = load_model('/path/to/saved_model.h5')\nreader = VideoReader('/path/to/video.mp4')\npredictions = model.predict(reader)\n```\n\n",
