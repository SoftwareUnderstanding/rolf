I bit modify the VocGAN's generator and used Full-Band MelGAN's discriminator instead of VocGAN's discriminator, as in my research I found MelGAN's discriminator is very fast while training and enough powerful to train Generator to produce high fidelity voice whereas VocGAN Hierarchically-nested JCU discriminator is quite huge and extremely slows the training process. \n",
