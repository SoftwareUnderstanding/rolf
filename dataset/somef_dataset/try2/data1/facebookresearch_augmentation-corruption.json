This paper studies how perceptual similarity between a set of training augmentations and a set of test corruptions affects test error on those corruptions and shows that common augmentation schemes often generalize poorly to perceptually dissimilar corruptions.  \nThe repository is divided into three parts.  First, the Jupyter notebook minimal_sample_distance.ipynb illustrates how to calculate the measure of distance between augmentations and corruptions proposed in the paper.  Second, imagenet_c_bar/ provides code to generate or test on the datasets CIFAR-10-C-bar and ImageNet-C-bar, which are algorithmically chosen to be dissimilar from CIFAR-10/ImageNet-C and are used to study generalization.  Finally, experiments/ provides code to reproduce the experiments in the paper.  Usage of these latter two is described in their respective READMEs. \n",
