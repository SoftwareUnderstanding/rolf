      "excerpt": "It differs from the standard DDPG architecture in that it has an additional critic in its structure, i.e. its twin. It has been added to make the Q-value prediction more stable and better. Adding a second critic is prevented by an overly optimistic estimate of stock values, which was a problem in the original DDPG method. This solution provides better stability during the testing phase. An additional characteristic is the delay that results from updating weight parameters during backpropagation of our neural networks, for target actor, critic targets, and critic models, respectively. \n",
