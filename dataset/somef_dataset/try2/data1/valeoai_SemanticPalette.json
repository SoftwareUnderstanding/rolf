      "excerpt": "Abstract: Despite the recent progress of generative adversarial networks (GANs) at synthesizing photo-realistic images, producing complex urban scenes remains a challenging problem. Previous works break down scene generation into two consecutive phases: unconditional semantic layout synthesis and image synthesis conditioned on layouts. In this work, we propose to condition layout generation as well for higher semantic control: given a vector of class proportions, we generate layouts with matching composition. To this end, we introduce a conditional framework with novel architecture designs and learning objectives, which effectively accommodates class proportions to guide the scene generation process. The proposed architecture also allows partial layout editing with interesting applications. Thanks to the semantic control, we can produce layouts close to the real distribution, helping enhance the whole scene generation process. On different metrics and urban scene benchmarks, our models outperform existing baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate the merit of our approach for data augmentation: semantic segmenters trained on real layout-image pairs along with additional ones generated by our approach outperform models only trained on real pairs. \nAll scripts are given for Cityscapes dataset. Note that similar scripts can be obtained for Cityscapes-25k (adding --load_extra flag), as well as for IDD and CelebA (setting --dataset flag to idd and celeba respectively). \n",

For new semantic content (which do not appear in the source image) we use a random style vector taken from the training dataset. Hence, we precompute style vectors by running:\n```\nbash scripts/extract_style.sh\n```\n\nThen, after updating the logs folder corresponding to style extraction, the following command performs face editing in different scenarios:\n```\nbash scripts/demo_face_editing_256.sh\n```\n\n",
