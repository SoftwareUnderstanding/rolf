Their implementation is slightly different than mine, so that may be something to keep in mind.\nYou should cite the paper if you use any of this code for your research:\n```\n@article{\n  velickovic2018graph,\n  title=\"{Graph Attention Networks}\",\n  author={Veli{\\v{c}}kovi{\\'{c}}, Petar and Cucurull, Guillem and Casanova, Arantxa and Romero, Adriana and Li{\\`{o}}, Pietro and Bengio, Yoshua},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJXMpikCZ},\n  note={Accepted as poster},\n}\n```\nIf you would like to give me credit, feel free to link to my [Github profile](https://github.com/danielegrattarola), [blog](https://danielegrattarola.github.io), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/riceasphait).\n\nI also copied the code in `utils.py` almost verbatim from [this repo by Thomas Kipf](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn), who I thank sincerely for sharing his work on GCNs and GAEs, and for giving me a few pointers on how to split the data into train/test/val sets.\n\nThanks to [mawright](https://github.com/mawright), [matthias-samwald](https://github.com/matthias-samwald), and [vermaMachineLearning](https://github.com/vermaMachineLearning) for helping me out with bugs, performance improvements, and running experiments.\n\n",
