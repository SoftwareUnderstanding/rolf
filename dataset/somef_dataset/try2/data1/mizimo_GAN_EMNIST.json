Too large a learning rate caused the GAN to diverge from the minimum, whereas too small almost always led to Mode Collapse.\n\nThe use of xavier initializer and relu layer (non leaky) gave best results.\n\n### Generated Samples\n<img src=\"https://github.com/mizimo/GAN_EMNIST/blob/master/train.gif\" width=\"50%\">\n\n*Fig. Samples generated during training*\n\n### Usage\nThe network was trained on 23x19 sized EMNIST images. For usage on a slightly different dataset, the dimension of the input in main.py and the dimension of the hidden layers in lib/generator.py and lib/discriminator.py need to be changed. "
