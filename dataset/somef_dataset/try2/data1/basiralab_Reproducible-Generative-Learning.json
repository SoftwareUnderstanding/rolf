Despite the large stream of GNNs developed recently, prior efforts invariably focus on boosting the classification accuracy while ignoring the model reproducibility and interpretability, which are vital in pinning down disorder-specific biomarkers. Although less investigated, the discriminativeness of the original input features -biomarkers, which is reflected by their learnt weights using a GNN gives informative insights about their reliability. Intuitively, the reliability of a given biomarker is emphasized if it belongs to the sets of top discriminative regions of interest (ROIs) using different models. Therefore, we define the first axis in our work as \\emph{reproducibility across models}, which evaluates the commonalities between sets of top discriminative biomarkers for a pool of GNNs. This task mainly answers this question: \\emph{How likely can two models be congruent in terms of their respective sets of top discriminative biomarkers?} The second axis of research in our work is to investigate \\emph{reproducibility in generated connectomic datasets}. This is addressed by answering this question: \\emph{how likely would the set of top discriminative biomarkers by a trained model for a ground-truth dataset be consistent with a predicted dataset by generative learning?} In this paper, we propose a reproducibility assessment framework, a method for quantifying the commonalities in the GNN-specific learnt feature maps across models, which can complement explanatory approaches of GNNs and provide new ways to assess predictive medicine via biomarkers reliability. We evaluated our framework using four multiview connectomic datasets of healthy neurologically disordered subjects with five GNN architectures and two different learning mindsets: (a) conventional training on all samples (resourceful) and (b) a few-shot training on random samples (frugal).*\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We provided within this code, the python file handle_data/simulate_data.py to simulate data. You should specify the number of subjects, the number of views and the number of regions. After simulating the dataset, you can predict the data via generative learning using this file topogan/main_topogan.py. The input data should be vectorized before using the generative learning. To vectorize the data, you can use handle_data/vectorize.py. The output of the generative learning is in a vectorized format. To restore the matrix format of the generated data, you can use this file handle_data/collect_generated.py. After predicting the dataset using generative learning, put both repositories (real and generated) in this path reproducibility/data. \n",
