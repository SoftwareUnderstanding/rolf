      "excerpt": "An attempt to map age progression in faces in images from the UTKFace dataset using CycleGANs. CycleGANs were introduced in this paper titled Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) where the authors presented an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. \nFor the images of faces with various ages we will be using the UTKFace dataset wich has a cropped image set of only faces marked with age , gender , race , etc. \n",
