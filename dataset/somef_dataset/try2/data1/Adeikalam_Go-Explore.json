It contains the class Phase1 to run the \"phase 1\" of the Go-Explore algorithm and an Environment class to train an agent on our game using RL.\n\nIn the folder Figures and Animations, you will find .gif files that illustrate our game and the results.\n\nThe file best_run.csv contains the \"ground truth\" that was obtained from phase 1. This is used for imitation learning."
