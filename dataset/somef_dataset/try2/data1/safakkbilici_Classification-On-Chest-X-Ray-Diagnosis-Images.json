Model is implemented in deep learning library PyTorch and the model is selected as pretrained model VGGNet16. VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper \u201cVery Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition\u201d. It was one of the famous model submitted to ILSVRC-2014. It makes the improvement over AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layer, respectively) with multiple 3\u00d73 kernel-sized filters one after another. Model evaluates that networks of increasing depth using an architecture with \nvery small (3 x 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16\u201319 weight layers.  \n",

Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe , whereas viral pneumonia manifests with a more diffuse \u2018\u2018interstitial\u2019\u2019 pattern in both lungs. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). \nChest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children\u2019s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients\u2019 routine clinical care. \nFor the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert. \n",

Dataset consists of variable-resolution images, while VGGNet requires a constant input dimensionality. Therefore, dataset is down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 224 \u00d7 224. Given a rectangular image, first is rescaling the image such that the shorter side was of length 224, and the second is cropped out the central 256\u00d7256 patch from the resulting image.I did not pre-process the images in any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. So model is trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels. (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). \n",
