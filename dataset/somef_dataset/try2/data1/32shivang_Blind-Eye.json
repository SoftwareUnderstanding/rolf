      "excerpt": "Given the constrain of the facenet model's accuracy, there are many ways you can improve accuracy in real world application. One of my suggestion would be to create a tracker for each detected face on screen, then run recognition on each of them in real time. Then, decide who is in each tracker after some number of frames (3 - 10 frames, depending on how fast your machine is). Keep doing the same thing until the tracker disappears or loses track. Your result can look somewhat like this: \n{\"Unknown\" :3, \"PersonA\": 1, \"PersonB\": 20} ---> This tracker is tracking PersonB \nThis will definitely improve your program liability, because the result will most likely be leaning toward the right subject in the picture after some number of frames, instead of just deciding right away after 1 frame like you normally would. One benefit of this approach is that the longer the person stays in front of the camera, the more accurate and confident the result is, as confidence points get incremented over time. \n",
