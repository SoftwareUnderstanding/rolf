Docker configurations are\nprovided for each case.\n\nIf you would just like to use the framework as-is, it is easiest to just install\nit through pip. This makes it possible to develop and train custom models using\na frozen version of the Lingvo framework. However, it is difficult to modify the\nframework code or implement new custom ops.\n\nIf you would like to develop the framework further and potentially contribute\npull requests, you should avoid using pip and clone the repository instead.\n\n**pip:**\n\nThe [Lingvo pip package](https://pypi.org/project/lingvo) can be installed with\n`pip3 install lingvo`.\n\nSee the\n[codelab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lingvo/blob/master/codelabs/introduction.ipynb)\nfor how to get started with the pip package.\n\n**From sources:**\n\nThe prerequisites are:\n\n*   a TensorFlow 2.7 [installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/),\n*   a `C++` compiler (only g++ 7.3 is officially supported), and\n*   the bazel build system.\n\nRefer to [docker/dev.dockerfile](docker/dev.dockerfile) for a set of working\nrequirements.\n\n`git clone` the repository, then use bazel to build and run targets directly.\nThe `python -m module` commands in the codelab need to be mapped onto `bazel\nrun` commands.\n\n**docker:**\n\nDocker configurations are available for both situations. Instructions can be\nfound in the comments on the top of each file.\n\n*   [lib.dockerfile](docker/lib.dockerfile) has the Lingvo pip package\n    preinstalled.\n*   [dev.dockerfile](docker/dev.dockerfile) can be used to build Lingvo from\n    sources.\n\n[How to install docker.](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)\n\n",

Time Zone Database\\n\\n  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\\nDatabase for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\\nis explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\\nDatabase section 7.\\n\\n # 7.  Database Ownership\\n #\\n #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\\n #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\\n #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\\n #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\\n #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\\n #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\\n #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\\n #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\\n #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\\n #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\\n #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\\n #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\\n #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\\n\\n6.
