Graph neural networks have an advantage that each node can be trained robustly. With this property, we hypothesized that each agent in an environment can be controlled individually. Since there have been many research papers related to graph neural networks, we would like to apply it to reinforcement learning. \n",

Taking the concatenation of previous states and actions, the graph is constructed. This stage is solving a regression problem in supervised learning. \nAfterward, the trained graph goes through NerveNet to perform an action. Also, the graph goes to MLP with concatenated state and action value to produce action value. Those two values are compared and trained using DDPG algorithm.  \nThe design of the network is shown below.  \n",
