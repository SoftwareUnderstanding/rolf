      "excerpt": "The amazing results that the model has produced has a secret sauce to it. The initial model couldn't create the sort of output I was expecting, it mostly struggled with recognizing facial features. Even though (https://github.com/yiranran/APDrawingGAN) produced great results it had limitations like (frontal face photo similar to ID photo, preferably with clear face features, no glasses and no long fringe.) I wanted to break-in and produce results that could recognize any pose. Achieving proper lines around the face, eyes, lips and nose depends on the data you give the model. APDrawing dataset alone was not enough so I had to combine selected photos from Anime sketch colorization pair dataset. The combined dataset helped the model to learn the lines better. \nThe movie poster was created using ArtLine in no time , it's not as good as it should be but I'm not an artist. \nSelf-Attention (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318). Generator is pretrained UNET with spectral normalization and self-attention. Something that I got from Jason Antic's DeOldify(https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify), this made a huge difference, all of a sudden I started getting proper details around the facial features. \nProgressive Resizing (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196),(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf). Progressive resizing takes this idea of gradually increasing the image size, In this project the image size were gradually increased and learning rates were adjusted. Thanks to fast.ai for intrdoucing me to Progressive resizing, this helps the model to generalise better as it sees many more different images. \n",
