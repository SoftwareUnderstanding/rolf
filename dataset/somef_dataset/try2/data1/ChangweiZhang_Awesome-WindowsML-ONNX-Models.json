With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. Windows ML only support ONNX format models. So we must need convert existed models in other format to ONNX models and this ONNX Generator is useful for you.\n\n[ONNX Project](https://github.com/onnx/onnx)\n\n[The offical documents for model converting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning/conversion-samples)\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Python 3.6.x\n* winmltools\n* [coremltools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools)\n* ONNX 1.2.2\n\n#### Install ONNX\n```\npip install onnx\n```\nmake sure the verison is 1.2.2\n\n#### Install Apple coremltools\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/apple/coremltools\n```\n#### Install winmltools\n```\npip install winmltools\n```\n\n\n### How to Use\n\nONNX Generator tool is located in the __tools__ folder\uff0cand just run the onnxgenerator.py script\uff1a\n\n\n```\npython onnxgenerator.py\n```\n\nNext step is input the path of CoreML model file\uff1a\n\n![model path](https://github.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/blob/master/images/step1.png?raw=true)\n\n\nInput the name of model, which will be used to generator c# class name by MLGen tool\n\n\n![model name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/master/images/step2.png)\n\nConvert to floating point 16\n\n![Optimize to float16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/master/images/step3.jpg)\n\nAfter ONNX file generated, you can confirm if you want a json model file\n\n\n![generate json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/master/images/step4.jpg)\n\nHere are the model files\uff1a\n\n![output model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/master/images/result.png)\n\n## Demos\n\nDemo projects in the src folder have __no ONNX model files__ by default and it can't be built.\n\n**You just should download the ONNX file from above links and place them into correct folders.**\n\n![LocationNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models/master/images/demo.png)\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf there is any question or issue, please create a new issue or just contact me. By the way, everyone can contribute to this project.\nHave a enjoy time!\n\nContact\uff1a\n\n\n* E-mail: [mantgh@outlook.com](mailto://mantgh@outlook.com)\n* Weibo: @msp\u7684\u660c\u4f1f\u54e5\u54e5"
