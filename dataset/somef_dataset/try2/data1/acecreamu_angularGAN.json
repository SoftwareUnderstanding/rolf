Therefore, you may follow original instruction for installation and dependincies. The new modules are implemented in Torch and do not require additional packages. \nThe MATLAB code generate_tinted_images.m allows to apply multi-illuimnant color cast to the input images. The tint maps are randomized and are not coherent between frames. </br> \n",
