      "excerpt": "Otitis Media (OM) is an infection of the middle ear. It is one of the most common childhood illnesses and the second most important reason leading to the loss of hearing. It is most common in developing countries and was ranked fifth on the global burden of disease and affected 1.23 billion people in 2013.\n\nOM is often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all, especially when it is in the early stages. It is often either under-diagnosed or over-diagnosed depending on the factors like clinicians, symptoms, otoscopes etc. Detection of OM requires a good medical practitioner (ENT), whose availability is difficult in remote village areas especially in developing countries. That is why OM is ignored amongst these kinds of groups and is a second major cause of hearing loss.\n\nThe aim of the study is to develop a diagnostic system using Ear Drum (Tympanic Membrane) images and applying machine learning to automatically extract certain features and perform image classification which can help diagnose otitis media(OM) with greater accuracy.\nThis diagnostic system will provide a reliable data to a survey volunteer to advise the patient or his family to visit an ENT or take professional help if OM is present.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WBPelBryAoE/WrJhXwz5XtI/AAAAAAAAEPA/iMSU4TXcNWIe7jK2G3P6xo4Ls4DWisbTgCLcBGAs/s1600/wix%2B11.jpg\" width=\"400\" title=\"Anatomy of the Ear\">\n\n\n",

      "excerpt": "Now we are ready to build a CNN. After dabbling a bit with tensorflow, I decided it was way too much work for something incredibly simple. I decided to use keras. Keras is a high-level API wrapper around tensorflow. It made coding lot more palatable. The approach I used was similar to this. I used a 3 convolutional layers in my architecture initially. \nTransfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify tanukis. \nTransfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch. \nThe most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following worfklow: \n",
