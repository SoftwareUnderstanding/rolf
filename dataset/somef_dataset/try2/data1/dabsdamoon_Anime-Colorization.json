Basically, what fusion layer does (in my case of coloring anime faces) is that if an input comes into the algorithm, it adds information about which anime character the input is to the encoded vector. Then, the algorithm begins to color it. Simply saying, it is based on the assumption that classifying the input first would help the algorithm giving a better colorization result. If you are interested in the concept of the fusion layer, below is a diagram briefly showing the concept of fusion layer (For more details, visit the link above).  \n",

Thus, many new versions of GAN trying to remove those disadvantages have been invented. WGAN(Wasserstein GAN) is one of those new versions by Arjovsky and Bottou (2017)(1), which applies a concept of Wasserstein Distance (Earth Mover's Distance). Instead of KL and JS divergence used for distance as a loss function in original GAN, WGAN use Wasserstein distance as a new loss function. The very brief reason of changing the loss function is due to the inability of KL and JS divergence to correctly capture the loss value, whereas Wasserstein distance metric is able to capture the value.  \n",
