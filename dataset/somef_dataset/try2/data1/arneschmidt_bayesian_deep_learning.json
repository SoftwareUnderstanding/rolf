For two example test points the mean and variance prediction is shown. \nThe variance gives information about the model uncertainty which can be very valuable in safety critical environments. \nNow we want to see how Bayesian neural networks can approximate Gaussian processes. The kernel of the Gaussian process depends on the activation function of the neural network. \nFirst, a normal GP with that kernel function is defined. As in the previous example, the GP posterior is calculated and plotted: \n",
