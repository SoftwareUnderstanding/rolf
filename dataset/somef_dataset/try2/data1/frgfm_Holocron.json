For this purpose, we advise you to use Github issues. \nFirst, check whether the topic wasn't already covered in an open / closed issue. If not, feel free to open a new one! When doing so, use issue templates whenever possible and provide enough information for other contributors to jump in.\nQuestions\nIf you are wondering how to do something with Holocron, or a more general question, you should consider checking out Github discussions. See it as a Q&A forum, or the Holocron-specific StackOverflow!\nSubmitting a Pull Request\nPreparing your local branch\n1 - Fork this repository by clicking on the \"Fork\" button at the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the project under your GitHub account (cf. Fork a repo).\n2 - Clone your fork to your local disk and set the upstream to this repo\nshell\ngit clone git@github.com:&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT&gt;/Holocron.git\ncd Holocron\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/frgfm/Holocron.git\n3 - You should not work on the master branch, so let's create a new one\nshell\ngit checkout -b a-short-description\n4 - You only have to set your development environment now. First uninstall any existing installation of the library with pip uninstall pylocron, then:\nshell\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\nDeveloping your feature\nCommits\n\nCode: ensure to provide docstrings to your Python code. In doing so, please follow Google-style so it can ease the process of documentation later.\nCommit message: please follow Udacity guide\n\nUnit tests\nIn order to run the same unit tests as the CI workflows, you can run unittests locally:\nshell\nmake test\nCode quality\nTo run all quality checks together\nshell\nmake quality\nLint verification\nTo ensure that your incoming PR complies with the lint settings, you need to install flake8 and run the following command from the repository's root folder:\nshell\nflake8 ./\nThis will read the .flake8 setting file and let you know whether your commits need some adjustments.\nImport order\nIn order to ensure there is a common import order convention, run isort as follows:\nshell\nisort **/*.py\nThis will reorder the imports of your local files.\nAnnotation typing\nAdditionally, to catch type-related issues and have a cleaner codebase, annotation typing are expected. After installing mypy, you can run the verifications as follows:\nshell\nmypy --config-file mypy.ini\nThe mypy.ini file will be read to check your typing.\nSubmit your modifications\nPush your last modifications to your remote branch\nshell\ngit push -u origin a-short-description\nThen open a Pull Request from your fork's branch. Follow the instructions of the Pull Request template and then click on \"Create a pull request\".",
