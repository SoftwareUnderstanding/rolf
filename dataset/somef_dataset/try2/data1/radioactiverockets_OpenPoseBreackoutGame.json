This will automatically download required models for OpenPose. \n4. Read the [detailed documentation](OpenPosePlugin/Assets/OpenPose/Documents/README.pdf) and make sure the portable OpenPose binaries work in your machine.\n5. Open Unity editor and run the \"Demo.unity\" in \"OpenPosePlugin/Assets/OpenPose/Examples/Scenes/\".\n6.
