Click here to watch our short presentation from WACV. \nThe given dummy dataset shows how the implementation expects the construction of a dataset. Coincidentally, the MVTec AD dataset is constructed in this way. \nSet the variables dataset_path and class_name in config.py to run experiments on a dataset of your choice.
