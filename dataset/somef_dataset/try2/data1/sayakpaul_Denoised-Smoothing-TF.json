This implementation is now a part of Neural Structured Learning. \nDenoised Smoothing is a simple and elegant way to (provably) robustify pre-trained image classification models (including the cloud APIs with only query access) and l2 adversarial attacks. This blog post provides a nice introduction to the method. The figure below summarizes what Denoised Smoothing is and how it works: \n",

But it assumes that a classifier performs well under Gaussian noisy perturbations which may not always be the case.   \nNote: I utilized many scripts from the official repository of Denoised Smoothing to develop this repository. My aim with this repository is to provide a template for researchers to conduct certification tests with Keras/TensorFlow models. I encourage the readers to check out the original repository, it's really well-developed. \n",
