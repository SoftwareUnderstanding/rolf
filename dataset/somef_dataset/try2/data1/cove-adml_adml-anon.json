    "excerpt": "Contributing\nThanks for considering contributing!  We want AllenNLP to be the way to do cutting-edge NLP research, but we cannot\nget there without community support.\nHow Can I Contribute?\nDid you find a bug?\nFirst, do a quick search to see whether your issue has already been reported.\nIf your issue has already been reported, please comment on the existing issue.\nOtherwise, open a new GitHub issue.  Be sure to include a clear title\nand description.  The description should include as much relevant information as possible.  The description should\nexplain how to reproduce the erroneous behavior as well as the behavior you expect to see.  Ideally you would include a\ncode sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior.\nDid you write a fix for a bug?\nOpen a new GitHub pull request with the fix.  Make sure you have a clear\ndescription of the problem and the solution, and include a link to relevant issues.\nOnce your pull request is created, our continuous build system will check your pull request.  Continuous\nbuild will test that:\n\npytest All tests pass\npylint accepts the code style (our guidelines are based on PEP8)\nmypy typechecks the Python code\nThe docs can be generated successfully\nTest coverage remains high.  Please add unit tests so we maintain our code coverage.\n\nIf your code fails one of these checks, you will be expected to fix your pull request before it is considered.\nYou can run most of these tests locally with ./scripts/verify.py, which will be faster than waiting for\ncloud systems to run tests.\nDo you have a suggestion for an enhancement?\nWe use GitHub issues to track enhancement requests.  Before you create an enhancement request:\n\n\nMake sure you have a clear idea of the enhancement you would like.  If you have a vague idea, consider discussing\nit first on the users list.\n\n\nCheck the documentation to make sure your feature does not already exist.\n\n\nDo a quick search to see whether your enhancement has already been suggested.\n\n\nWhen creating your enhancement request, please:\n\n\nProvide a clear title and description.\n\n\nExplain why the enhancement would be useful.  It may be helpful to highlight the feature in other libraries.\n\n\nInclude code examples to demonstrate how the enhancement would be used.\n\n\nDo you have a new state-of-the-art model?\nWe are always looking for new models to add to our collection.  If you have trained a model and would like to include it in \nAllenNLP, please create a pull request that includes:\n\nAny code changes needed to support your new model.\nA link to the model itself.  Please do not check your model into the GitHub repository, but instead upload it in the \nPR conversation or provide a link to it at an external location.\n\nIn the description of your PR, please clearly explain the task your model performs along with precision and recall statistics \non an established dataset.",
