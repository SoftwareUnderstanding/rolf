From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.\n\nUse the `model/predict` endpoint to load a test image (you can use one of the test images from the `samples/test_examples/low_resolution` folder) in order to get a high resolution output image returned.\n\nThe ideal input image is a PNG file with a resolution between 100x100 and 500x500, preferably without any post-capture processing and flashy colors. The model is able to generate details from a pixelated image (low DPI), but is not able to correct a 'blurred' image.\n\n![input](docs/example.png)\n_Left: input image (128\u00d780). Right: output image (512\u00d7320)_\n\n![Swagger UI screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)\n\nYou can also test it on the command line, for example:\n\n```\n$ curl -F \"image=@samples/test_examples/low_resolution/food.png\" -XPOST http://localhost:5000/model/predict > food_high_res.png\n```\n\nThe above command will send the low resolution `food.png` file to the model, and save the high resolution output image to the `food_high_res.png` file in the root directory.\n\n",
