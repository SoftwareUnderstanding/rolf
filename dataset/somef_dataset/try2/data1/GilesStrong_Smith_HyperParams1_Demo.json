Either install/update dependencies, or if using conda:\n\t- `conda env update -f binder/environment.yml`\n\t- `conda activate smith-HP-1`\n\n### Binder\nClick badge at top, or go to (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GilesStrong/Smith_HyperParams1_Demo/master). Note, this is pretty slow and shouldn't be used to run the code, only to view it.\n\n### Docker\n1. `docker pull gilesstrong/smith_hyperparams1_demo`\n1. `docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name=smith gilesstrong/smith_hyperparams1_demo`\n1. `docker exec smith jupyter notebook list`\n1.
