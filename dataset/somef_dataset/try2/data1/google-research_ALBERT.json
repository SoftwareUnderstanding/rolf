On average, ALBERT-xxlarge is slightly worse than the v1, because of the following two reasons: 1) Training additional 1.5 M steps (the only difference between these two models is training for 1.5M steps and 3M steps) did not lead to significant performance improvement. 2) For v1, we did a little bit hyperparameter search among the parameters sets given by BERT, Roberta, and XLnet. For v2, we simply adopt the parameters from v1 except for RACE, where we use a learning rate of 1e-5 and 0 ALBERT DR (dropout rate for ALBERT in finetuning). The original (v1) RACE hyperparameter will cause model divergence for v2 models. Given that the downstream tasks are sensitive to the fine-tuning hyperparameters, we should be careful about so called slight improvements. \nALBERT is \"A Lite\" version of BERT, a popular unsupervised language \n",

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\\n\\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\\n\\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\\n\\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
