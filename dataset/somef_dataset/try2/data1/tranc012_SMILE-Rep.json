The primary code is sourced from Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722 ) with minor changes for compatiability and hyperparameter adapations. Due to the large size, I cannot provide the saved model weights nor the data directly here. Note: the reported problem is related to the computational speed, not the accuracy/performance.  \n",

We split this data by percentages, and end up with the corresponding number of images: unsupervised data (564601), training data (150560), and testing data (37640). To show the effectiveness of the method on reduced labeled images, 20% of the training data was used giving 30112 images for the benchmark experiment on the A100. This is a multi-label classification problem from 6 classes.  \n",

In this supervised stage, we fine-tune the entire model along with a linear classifier, initialized by the saved weights from the previous unsupervised step. As mentioned before, in the HiPerGator implementation, 20% of the training data was used along with the test set, evaluated at every epoch. For the benchmark task, the speed was examined on 100 epochs.  \nFor some note in the code MoCo_downstream, there are some true-false flags that can be passed in order to specify certain model designs: other considerations are Resnet-50 training (in which the unsupervised weights are not passed, giving a basic Resnet-50 supervised training), and MoCo-Freeze (in which the supervised weights are passed but the model is frozen, training only the linear classifier).  \n",
