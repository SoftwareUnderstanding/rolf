    "excerpt": "# Dog Breed Classification using InceptionV3 CNN Model on Stanford Dogs Dataset\n## Description\nThe <a href= \"http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/\">Stanford Dogs Dataset</a> contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in colour and age.\n\nI have used the InceptionV3 CNN Model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset for classification. Data augementation has been used for making the model generalize better and also to avoid overfitting. The model achieved an accuracy of 80% on validation set, which is decent for this dataset.\n\n## Getting Started\nThe `inceptionV3-for-stanford-dogs-dataset.ipynb` notebook can be directly run on Kaggle after loading the dataset in the Kaggle Kernel. Use Kaggle's Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU for faster training and evaluation.\n\n### Pre-Requisites\nFor running the notebook on your local machine, following pre-requisites must be satisfied:\n- NumPy\n- Pandas\n- Scikit-image\n- IPython\n- Matplotlib\n- Tensorflow 2.X\n- Keras\n\n### Installation\n**Dependencies:**\n```\n# With Tensorflow CPU\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# With Tensorflow GPU\npip install -r requirements-gpu.txt\n```\n**Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you haven't set it up already):**\n```\n# Ubuntu 20.04\nsudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt install nvidia-driver-430\n\n# Windows/Other\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx\n```\n## Dataset\nContents of the dataset:\n- Number of categories: 120\n- Number of images: 20,580\n- Annotations: Class labels, Bounding boxes\n\nThe dataset can be downloaded from <a href= \"http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/\">here.</a>\n\nSample images of 50 different categories from the dataset:\n\n![Images of Dogs](/images/dogs_images.jpeg)\n\n## Approach\n### Data Augmentation\nData augmentation is done through the following techniques:\n- Rescaling (1./255)\n- Shear Transformation (0.2)\n- Zoom (0.2)\n- Horizontal Flipping\n- Rotation (20)\n- Width Shifting (0.2)\n- Height Shifting (0.2)\n\n![Augmented Image](/images/augmented_image.png)\n\n### Model Details\n```\n_________________________________________________________________\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #",
