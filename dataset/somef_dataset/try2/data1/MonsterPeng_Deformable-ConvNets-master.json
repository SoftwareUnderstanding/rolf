      "excerpt": "Q: It says `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'DeformableConvolution'`.\n\nA: This is because either\n - you forget to copy the operators to your MXNet folder\n - or you copy to the wrong path\n - or you forget to re-compile\n - or you install the wrong MXNet\n\n    Please print `mxnet.__path__` to make sure you use correct MXNet\n\n<br/><br/>\nQ: I encounter `segment fault` at the beginning.\n\nA: A compatibility issue has been identified between MXNet and opencv-python 3.0+. We suggest that you always `import cv2` first before `import mxnet` in the entry script. \n\n<br/><br/>\nQ: I find the training speed becomes slower when training for a long time.\n\nA: It has been identified that MXNet on Windows has this problem. So we recommend to run this program on Linux. You could also stop it and resume the training process to regain the training speed if you encounter this problem.\n\n<br/><br/>\nQ: Can you share your caffe implementation?\n\nA: Due to several reasons (code is based on a old, internal Caffe, port to public Caffe needs extra work, time limit, etc.). We do not plan to release our Caffe code. Since current MXNet convolution implementation is very similar to Caffe (almost the same), it is easy to port to Caffe by yourself, the core CUDA code could be kept unchanged. Anyone who wish to do it is welcome to make a pull request.\n",

Due to the rapid development of MXNet, it is recommended to checkout this version if you encounter any issues. We may maintain this repository periodically if MXNet adds important feature in future release.\n\n2. Python 2.7. We recommend using Anaconda2 as it already includes many common packages. We do not support Python 3 yet, if you want to use Python 3 you need to modify the code to make it work.\n\n\n3. Python packages might missing: cython, opencv-python >= 3.2.0, easydict. If `pip` is set up on your system, those packages should be able to be fetched and installed by running\n\t```\n\tpip install -r requirements.txt\n\t```\n4. For Windows users, Visual Studio 2015 is needed to compile cython module.\n\n\n",

To use the demo with our pre-trained deformable models, please download manually from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am-5JzdW2XHzhqMSjehIcCgAhvEAHw) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dFlPFED), and put it under folder `model/`.\n\n\tMake sure it looks like this:\n\t```\n\t./model/rfcn_dcn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/rfcn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/fpn_dcn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/fpn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/rcnn_dcn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/rcnn_coco-0000.params\n\t./model/deeplab_dcn_cityscapes-0000.params\n\t./model/deeplab_cityscapes-0000.params\n\t./model/deform_conv-0000.params\n\t./model/deform_psroi-0000.params\n\t```\n2. To run the R-FCN demo, run\n\t```\n\tpython ./rfcn/demo.py\n\t```\n\tBy default it will run Deformable R-FCN and gives several prediction results, to run R-FCN, use\n\t```\n\tpython ./rfcn/demo.py --rfcn_only\n\t```\n3. To run the DeepLab demo, run\n\t```\n\tpython ./deeplab/demo.py\n\t```\n\tBy default it will run Deformable Deeplab and gives several prediction results, to run DeepLab, use\n\t```\n\tpython ./deeplab/demo.py --deeplab_only\n\t```\n4. To visualize the offset of deformable convolution and deformable psroipooling, run\n\t```\n\tpython ./rfcn/deform_conv_demo.py\n\tpython ./rfcn/defrom_psroi_demo.py\n\t```\n\n\n",

      "excerpt": "1. All of our experiment settings (GPU #, dataset, etc.) are kept in yaml config files at folder `./experiments/rfcn/cfgs`, `./experiments/faster_rcnn/cfgs` and `./experiments/deeplab/cfgs/`.\n2. Eight config files have been provided so far, namely, R-FCN for COCO/VOC, Deformable R-FCN for COCO/VOC, Faster R-CNN(2fc) for COCO/VOC, Deformable Faster R-CNN(2fc) for COCO/VOC, Deeplab for Cityscapes/VOC and Deformable Deeplab for Cityscapes/VOC, respectively. We use 8 and 4 GPUs to train models on COCO and on VOC for R-FCN, respectively. For deeplab, we use 4 GPUs for all experiments.\n\n3. To perform experiments, run the python scripts with the corresponding config file as input. For example, to train and test deformable convnets on COCO with ResNet-v1-101, use the following command\n    ```\n    python experiments\\rfcn\\rfcn_end2end_train_test.py --cfg experiments\\rfcn\\cfgs\\resnet_v1_101_coco_trainval_rfcn_dcn_end2end_ohem.yaml\n    ```\n    A cache folder would be created automatically to save the model and the log under `output/rfcn_dcn_coco/`.\n4. Please find more details in config files and in our code.\n\n",
