In addition to the EM-net, a variety of other deep learning methods have also been implemented including U-net, SegNet, ResNet and VGG. All these networks represent a similar encoding-decoding scheme for image segmentation. We have implemented a variety of evaluation metrics which allows you to obtain the maximum desirable performance. Moreover, this notebook offers K-fold cross valiadtion that can be used for training these networks when the training data is limited. Finally, this notebook will enable the users to use ensemble of desirable models for final stage inference on the test data. \n<font size = 4>Papers related to this Notebook:  \n",
