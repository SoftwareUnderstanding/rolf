      "excerpt": "At this level, if you have pre-processed binary data in pth format (for example from XLM experimentation or improvised by yourself), group them in a specific folder that you will mention as a parameter by calling the script [train.py](XLM/train.py).  \nIf this is not the case, we assume that you have txt files available for preprocessing. Look at the following example for which we have three translation tasks: `English-French, German-English and German-French`.\n\nWe have the following files available for preprocessing: \n```\n- en-fr.en.txt and en-fr.fr.txt \n- de-en.de.txt and de-en.en.txt \n- de-fr.de.txt and de-fr.fr.txt \n```\nAll these files must be in the same folder (`PARA_PATH`).  \nYou can also (only or optionally) have monolingual data available (`en.txt, de.txt and fr.txt`; in `MONO_PATH` folder).  \nParallel and monolingual data can all be in the same folder.\n\n**Note** : Languages must be submitted in alphabetical order (`de-en and not en-de, fr-ru and not ru-fr...`). If you submit them in any order you will have problems loading data during training, because when you run the [train.py](XLM/train.py) script the parameters like the language pair are put back in alphabetical order before being processed. Don't worry about this alphabetical order restriction, XLM for MT is naturally trained to translate sentences in both directions. See [translate.py](scripts/translate.py).\n\n[OPUS collections](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) is a good source of dataset. We illustrate in the [opus.sh](scripts/opus.sh) script how to download the data from opus and convert it to a text file.  \nChanging parameters ($PARA_PATH and $SRC) in [opus.sh](scripts/opus.sh).\n```\ncd meta_XLM\nchmod +x ./scripts/opus.sh\n./scripts/opus.sh de-fr\n```\n\nAnother source for `other_languages-english` data is [anki Tab-delimited Bilingual Sentence Pairs](http://www.manythings.org/anki/). Simply download the .zip file, unzip to extract the `other_language.txt` file. This file usually contains data in the form of `sentence_en sentence_other_language other_information` on each line. See [anki.py](scripts/anki.py) and [anky.sh](scripts/anki.sh) in relation to a how to extract data from [anki](http://www.manythings.org/anki/). Example of how to download and extract `de-en` and `en-fr` pair data.\n```\ncd meta_XLM\noutput_path=/content/data/para\nmkdir $output_path\nchmod +x ./scripts/anki.sh\n./scripts/anki.sh de,en deu-eng $output_path scripts/anki.py\n./scripts/anki.sh en,fr fra-eng $output_path scripts/anki.py\n```\nAfter that you will have in `data/para` following files : `de-en.de.txt, de-en.en.txt, deu.txt, deu-eng.zip and _about.txt`  \n\nMove to the `XLM` folder in advance.  \n```\ncd XLM\n```\nInstall the following dependencies ([fastBPE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/tree/master/tools#fastbpe) and [Moses](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/tree/master/tools#tokenizers)) if you have not already done so. \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder tools/mosesdecoder\ngit clone https://github.com/glample/fastBPE tools/fastBPE && cd tools/fastBPE && g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -O3 fastBPE/main.cc -IfastBPE -o fast\n```\n  \nChanging parameters in [data.sh](data.sh). Between lines 94 and 100 of [data.sh](data.sh), you have two options corresponding to two scripts to execute according to the distribution of the folders containing your data. Option 2 is chosen by default, kindly uncomment the lines corresponding to your option.  \nWith too many BPE codes (depending on the size of the dataset) you may get this [error](https://github.com/glample/fastBPE/issues/7). Decrease the number of codes (e.g. you can dichotomously search for the appropriate/maximum number of codes that make the error disappear)\n\n```\nlanguages=de,en,fr\nchmod +x ../data.sh \n../data.sh $languages\n```\n\nIf you stop the execution when processing is being done on a file please delete this erroneous file before continuing or restarting the processing, otherwise the processing will continue with this erroneous file and potential errors will certainly occur.  \n\nAfter this you will have the following (necessary) files in `$OUTPATH` (and `$OUTPATH/fine_tune` depending on the parameter `$sub_task`):  \n\n```\n- monolingual data :\n    - training data   : train.fr.pth, train.en.pth and train.de.pth\n    - test data       : test.fr.pth, test.en.pth and test.de.pth\n    - validation data : valid.fr.pth, valid.en.pth and valid.de.pth\n- parallel data :\n    - training data : \n        - train.en-fr.en.pth and train.en-fr.fr.pth \n        - train.de-en.en.pth and train.de-en.de.pth\n        - train.de-fr.de.pth and train.de-fr.fr.pth \n    - test data :\n        - test.en-fr.en.pth and test.en-fr.fr.pth \n        - test.de-en.en.pth and test.de-en.de.pth\n        - test.de-fr.de.pth and test.de-fr.fr.pth \n    - validation data\n        - valid.en-fr.en.pth and valid.en-fr.fr.pth \n        - valid.de-en.en.pth and valid.de-en.de.pth\n        - valid.de-fr.de.pth and valid.de-fr.fr.pth \n - code and vocab\n```\nTo use the biblical corpus, run [bible.sh](bible.sh) instead of [data.sh](data.sh). Here is the list of languages available (and to be specified as `$languages` value) in this case : \n- **Languages with data in the New and Old Testament** : `Francais, Anglais, Fulfulde_Adamaoua or Fulfulde_DC (formal name : Fulfulde), Bulu, KALATA_KO_SC_Gbaya or KALATA_KO_DC_Gbaya (formal name :  Gbaya), BIBALDA_TA_PELDETTA (formal name : MASSANA), Guiziga, Kapsiki_DC (formal name : Kapsiki), Tupurri`.\n- **Languages with data in the New Testament only** : `Bafia, Ejagham, Ghomala, MKPAMAN_AMVOE_Ewondo (formal name : Ewondo), Ngiemboon, Dii, Vute, Limbum, Mofa, Mofu_Gudur, Doyayo, Guidar, Peere_Nt&Psalms, Samba_Leko, Du_na_sdik_na_wiini_Alaw`.  \nIt is specified in [bible.sh](bible.sh) that you must have in `csv_path` a folder named csvs. Here is the [drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NuSJ-NT_BsU1qopLu6avq6SzUEf6nVkk/view?usp=sharing) of its zipped version.  \nConcerning training, specify the first four letters of each language (`Bafi` instead of `Bafia` for example), except `KALATA_KO_SC_Gbaya/KALATA_KO_DC_Gbaya which becomes Gbay (first letters of Gbaya), BIBALDA_TA_PELDETTA which becomes MASS (first letters of MASSANA), MKPAMAN_AMVOE_Ewondo which becomes Ewon (first letters of Ewondo), Francais and Anglais which becomes repectively fr and en`. Indeed, [bible.sh](bible.sh) uses these abbreviations to create the files and not the language names themselves.  \nOne last thing in the case of the biblical corpus is that when only one language is to be specified, it must be specified twice. For example: `languages=Bafia,Bafia` instead of `languages=Bafia`.\n\n",

Attribution.\\n\\n       1.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\\'s\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\\n     only;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b.
