      "excerpt": "This demo is a Swift program that uses a pre-trained Inception model (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567).\n\nIt can load the prebuilt model into a Perfect TensorFlow Session object, like this:\n\n``` swift\nlet g = try TF.Graph()\nlet def = try TF.GraphDef(serializedData: model)\ntry g.import(definition: def)\n```\n\nAccompanied by this model, a known object name list also would be loaded into memory if success.\n\n``` swift\ntry fTag.open(.read)\nlet lines = try fTag.readString()\ntags = lines.utf8.split(separator: 10).map { String(describing: $0) }\n// the tags should be looks like this if success:\n// tags = [\"dummy\", \"kit fox\", \"English setter\", \"Siberian husky\" ...]\n```\n\nOnce received a picture from client, it will decode the picture (in jpeg format) and normalize it into a specific form:\n\n``` swift\n  public func constructAndExecuteGraphToNormalizeImage(imageBytes: Data) throws -> TF.Tensor {\n    let H:Int32 = 224\n    let W:Int32 = 224\n    let mean:Float = 117\n    let scale:Float = 1\n    let input = try g.constant(name: \"input2\", value: imageBytes)\n    let batch = try g.constant( name: \"make_batch\", value: Int32(0))\n    let scale_v = try g.constant(name: \"scale\", value: scale)\n    let mean_v = try g.constant(name: \"mean\", value: mean)\n    let size = try g.constantArray(name: \"size\", value: [H,W])\n    let jpeg = try g.decodeJpeg(content: input, channels: 3)\n    let cast = try g.cast(value: jpeg, dtype: TF.DataType.dtFloat)\n    let images = try g.expandDims(input: cast, dim: batch)\n    let resizes = try g.resizeBilinear(images: images, size: size)\n    let subbed = try g.sub(x: resizes, y: mean_v)\n    let output = try g.div(x: subbed, y: scale_v)\n    let s = try g.runner().fetch(TF.Operation(output)).run()\n    guard s.count > 0 else { throw TF.Panic.INVALID }\n    return s[0]\n  }//end normalize\n```\n\nThen you can run a TensorFlow session from this picture input:\n\n``` swift\nlet result = try g.runner().feed(\"input\", tensor: image).fetch(\"output\").run()\n```\n\nThe result is actually a possibility array which matches the known object name list, i.e., each object in this name list will have a possibility prediction in the corresponding array slot. So checking the max possibility throughout the array may get the most possible object that the input image could be:\n\n``` swift\npublic func match(image: Data) throws -> (Int, Int) {\n    let normalized = try constructAndExecuteGraphToNormalizeImage(imageBytes: image)\n    let possibilities = try executeInceptionGraph(image: normalized)\n    guard let m = possibilities.max(), let i = possibilities.index(of: m) else {\n      throw TF.Panic.INVALID\n    }//end guard\n    return (i, Int(m * 100))\n  }\n```\n\nThe final step is translating the result object index into the tag name of the object and sending it back to the client:\n\n``` swift\nlet tag = tags[result.0]\n      let p = result.1\n      response.setHeader(.contentType, value: \"text/json\")\n        .appendBody(string: \"{\\\"value\\\": \\\"Is it a \\(tag)? (Possibility: \\(p)%)\\\"}\")\n        .completed()\n```\n\n",
