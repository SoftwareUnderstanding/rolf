The upper layers are used to process the image files through multiple convolutions by using pretrained weights of the model. Here are the links to learn more about the pretrained model:\n- https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567\n\nWe achieved 88% accuracy on validation set, and 92% accuracy on training set.\n",

It contains step-by-step on how to create the image classifier. \n- The apple.jpg is just an image for our home page\n- 'model_inception_weights.h5' is the trained weights of our deep learning model's layers. This is used to load the model in our web app.\n- 'streamlit-apple.py' is the python file to deploy our web app in Streamlit.\n\nTo run the project locally, you can download this repo and type ```streamlit run streamlit-apple.py``` inside this folder's directory. \nTo view the project as a deployed online web app hosted by Streamlit, we can check out this link: https://share.streamlit.io/radvian/apple-img/main/streamlit-apple.py\n\n",
