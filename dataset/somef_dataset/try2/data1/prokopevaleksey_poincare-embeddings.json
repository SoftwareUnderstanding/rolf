      "excerpt": "The main idea of the paper is to use Hyperbolic space for embedding hierarchical data.  \nNaturally, we want to represent data which have some sort of hierarchy in the way that related objects would be located in the neighbourhood of one another.  \nAs we go down the hierarchical tree the number of objects in that neighbourhoods increases exponentially. \nIf we want to fit these objects in Euclidean space we have to dramatically increase the dimensionality.  \nUsage of Hyperbolic space solves this specific problem and authors claim to archive impressive results. \n",
