Most scripts are designed to spin up a TPU, SSH into it to set up the dependencies\nand copy code over from the local directory, and then start a [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git) worker\nwhich can accept RPC calls.\n\nThe TPUVMs handles running model training steps and evaluation, checkpoint save and loading, while the driver python\nprogram handles data loading and general orchestration (such as when to save checkpoints etc).\n\nThis means that most scripts (`train.py`, `eval_harness.py` etc) expect to be running on a GCE virtual machine in the\nsame region as the TPUs, to minimize RPC latency and data transfer cost. Other scripts\n(usually ones which don't take a `--tpu` argument, such as `device_sample.py`, `device_serve.py` or `device_train.py`)\nexpect to be run directly on a TPUVM. The device_* scripts **only work on a v3-8** and not on larger pods.\n\nFurthermore, there is an example (`resharding_example.py`) of how to convert the provided checkpoints (which have 8\nshards in the case of GPT-J-6B) down to a smaller number, such as for when running on GPU(s).\n\n",
