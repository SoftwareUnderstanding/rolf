The model \nachieved a 56% top 1 accuracy on validation set and a 80% top 5 accuracy on the validation set. This is about 3% under the reported results. Causes for this \ncould be that the network was trained with a batch size of 256 instead of 1024, and because of the the number of steps required for 120 epochs increased 4 fold. \nThe learning rate schedule was modified to account for the lower batch size and the increased number of steps.   \n",

After downloading these files please perform the following steps to prepare the dataset.\n\n- Create a directory used for processing and storing the dataset.\n    Please note you should have at least around 500 GB of free space available on the drive you are processing the dataset. \n    Once this directory is created copy the 3 files downloaded earlier to the root of this directory from that directory execute\n    the following command:\n  ```Shell\n     export DATA_DIR=$(pwd)\n     \n     ```\n    \n\n- Execute the following command from this projects root folder:\n  ```Shell\n  bash datasets/process_downloaded_imagenet.sh $DATA_DIR\n  \n  ```\n  Where $DATA_DIR is the root of the directory created to hold the 3 downloaded files.\n  \n- Wait for processing to finish.\n    The script process_downloaded_imagenet.sh will automatically extract the tarballs and process al the data into tf-records.\n    The whole process can take between 2 and 5 hours depending on how fast the hard drive and cpu are.\n\n",
