This project adopts scaled multiplicative attention presented in Attention Is All You Need. \nThis project adopts variational dropout presented in A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks. \nTo solve the degradation problem in stacked RNN, outputs of each layer are concatenated to produce the final output. \nWhen the loss on dev set increases in a certain period, the learning rate is halved. \nDuring prediction, the project adopts search method presented in Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer. \nTo address efficiency issue, this implementation uses bucketing method (contributed by xiongyifan) and CudnnGRU. The bucketing method can speedup training, but will lower the F1 score by 0.3%. \n",
