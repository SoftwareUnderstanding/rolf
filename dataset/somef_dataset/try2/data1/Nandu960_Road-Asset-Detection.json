      "excerpt": "The project aims to develop a Road Asset Detection system using convolution neural network. We had modified existing tiny YOLO model for the detections. \nOur project is an extended work on the blooming Computer Vision on  localization of relevant objects. We implement a real-time system capable of accounting for different road assets like traffic signs,potholes,lanes,zebra lines and vehicles . We have used the YOLO model for this purpose.We used this model as they have superior localization and classification in addition to easier modification of layers,via transfer learning.We further seek to implement a fully functional real time system on Indian Roads. \n",
