More details about SyncBN and SyncSN can refer to this. \n2018/7/27: The pretrained models of ResNet50+SN(8,1) and SN(8,4) have been released. These models may help in the finetuning stage when the batch size of a target task is constrained to be small. We also release the pretrained models of ResNet101v2+SN that achieves 78.81%/94.16% top-1/top-5 accuracies on ImageNet. More pretrained models will be released soon! \n2018/7/26: The code for object detection have been released in the repository of SwitchNorm_Detection. \n2018/7/9: We would like to explain the merit behind SN.
