Comparatively, unsupervised\nlearning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help\nbridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and\nunsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional\ngenerative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural\nconstraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised\nlearning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that\nour deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations\nfrom object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator.\nAdditionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their\napplicability as general image representations.},\n  added-at = {2018-05-21T17:55:23.000+0200},\n  author = {Radford, Alec and Metz, Luke and Chintala, Soumith},\n  biburl = {https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a114a1bd36bb9b5542f620b0c1d1c050/lw4},\n  description = {Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative\n  Adversarial Networks},\n  interhash = {ae6fc4b7593a1d0e31aeeff9fef81a36},\n  intrahash = {a114a1bd36bb9b5542f620b0c1d1c050},\n  keywords = {gan},\n  note = {cite arxiv:1511.06434Comment: Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016},\n  timestamp = {2018-05-21T17:55:23.000+0200},\n  title = {Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative\n  Adversarial Networks},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434},\n  year = 2015\n}",
