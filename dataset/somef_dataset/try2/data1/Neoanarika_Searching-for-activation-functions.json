      "excerpt": "This project attempts to implement NIPS 2017 paper \"Searching for activation function\" (Zoph & Le 2017). Although neural networks are powerful and flexible models, they are still hard to design and limited by human creativity. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, the paper claims to be able to discover multiple novel activation functions. We tried to verify the claims of this paper by replicating the original study. However we were unable to get good results as probably due to the lack of massive computing resources used in the original experiment (800 Titan X GPUs). \n",

      "excerpt": "Clearly we are doing something wrong, the problem with implementing these papers is that even if it doesn't work, it could be due to us not running it long enough, or perhaps there's a bug in the program that we are unaware of that is causing the negative result. \nWe also implemented swish, which was the activaiton function found and discussed in the original paper \n",
