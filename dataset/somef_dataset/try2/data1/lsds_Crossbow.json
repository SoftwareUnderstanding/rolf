      "excerpt": "Crossbow utilises modern GPUs better than other systems by training multiple  model replicas on the same GPU. When the batch size is sufficiently small to leave GPU resources unused, Crossbow trains a second model replica, a third, etc., as long as training throughput increases. \nTo synchronise many model replicas, Crossbow uses synchronous model averaging to adjust the trajectory of each individual replica based on the average of all. With model averaging, the batch size does not increase linearly with the number of model replicas, as it would with synchronous SGD. This yields better statistical efficiency without cumbersome hyper-parameter tuning when trying to scale training to a larger number of GPUs. \nSee our VLDB 2019 paper for more details. \nThe system supports a variety of training algorithms, including synchronous SGD. We are working to seemlesly port existing TensorFlow models to Crossbow. \nCrossbow uses page-locked memory regions to speed up data transfers from CPU to GPU and vice versa. The amount of memory locked by the system usually exceeds the default OS limit. Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and append the following lines to the end of the file: \n",

      "excerpt": "**Crossbow** has been primarily tested on Ubuntu Linux 16.04. It requires the following Linux packages:\n\n```shell\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential git openjdk-8-jdk maven libboost-all-dev graphviz wget\n```\n \n**Crossbow** requires NVIDIA's [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) toolkit, the [cuDDN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) library and the [NCCL](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-install-guide/index.html) library (currently using versions 8.0, 6.0, and 2.1.15, respectively). After successful installation, make sure that:\n\n* `CUDA_HOME` is set (the default location is `/usr/local/cuda`)\n* `NCCL_HOME` is set\n\nand that:\n\n* `PATH` includes `$CUDA_HOME/bin` and\n* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes `$CUDA_HOME/lib64` and `$NCCL_HOME/lib`\n\n**Crossbow** also requires the [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git) and [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) libraries. After successful installation, make sure that:\n\n* `BLAS_HOME` is set (the default location is `/opt/OpenBLAS`)\n* `JPEG_HOME` is set\n\nand that:\n\n* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes `$BLAS_HOME/lib` and `$JPEG_HOME/lib`\n\n",
