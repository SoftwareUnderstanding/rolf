PyBullet is a free and open-source alternative to MuJoCo, with no license fees and no hardware lock (MuJoCo personal licenses are limited to 3 physical machines, which means you cannot run simulations in the cloud, e.g. AWS/GCP/etc). \nThis repo itself is a fork of the official TD3 code from the original authors of TD3, Fujimoto et al. All results presented here are derived using the original authors' algorithm implementations. Thus, references to \"TD3\", \"OurDDPG\", and \"DDPG\" below refer to Fujimoto et al's implementations. \nPer the original repo, results were generated with Python 2.7 and PyTorch 0.4. Specific to this repo, PyBullet 2.4.8 was used. To obtain these results, run: \n",
