There is no easy way to go from the paper title to Semantic Scholar's paper ID (i.e., it's not possible from the API). So we just search for it with Selenium and apply a few checks to see if it's the same paper.\n\nThis may take an hour or so to get through all the papers. There are also occasional hit limits where you may have to pick up from a point. Thus, one may need to monitor the window that opens. (It's possible to automate this by checking for the existence of certain elements on the screen, though I haven't been bothered enough by it to implement this.)\n\nWith the paper ID, we can then use [Semantic Scholar's API](https://api.semanticscholar.org/) to easily fetch the number of citations for the paper.\n\n",
