(In our case the harry potter books were used and the cleaned text can be found in this  **[github](https://github.com/khushmeeet/potter-nlp/tree/master/final_data)**)\nFinally if there is no word_sets.txt file you need to generate word sets first. This can be done by printing the top 5 words predicted by our classification model into a text file named word_sets.txt. \n\n",
