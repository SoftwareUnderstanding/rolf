      "excerpt": "First of all, it is important to specify that it seems to emerge 2 main methods allowing to increase the quality of an image via Deep Learning methods (DL) :  \n1st Method (CNN & GAN): tTis method is based on the use on DL methods including CNN and GAN. This can also be found in literature, one publication [1] \u201cSurvey_SR.pdf\u201d summarizes the different steps allowing the use of DL for Super-Resolution (SR). Another publication [2] \u201cGAN_for_SR.pdf\u201d is dedicated to the use of GANs in SR applications. The codes tested and provided during this project are based the methods detailed in these two publications and particularly the architecture of GANs. \n2nd Method (without GAN): another method, that seems to be possible without the use of GAN, is given in details in the following article [3] (https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-based-super-resolution-without-using-a-gan-11c9bb5b6cd5). The author actually justifies the use of this method by stating that \u00ab  One of the limitations of GANs is that they are effectively a lazy approach as their loss function, the critic, is trained as part of the process and not specifically engineered for this purpose. This could be one of the reasons many models are only good at super resolution and not image repair \u00bb. In this article, the author goes into details about the different implemented steps: \nUne autre m\u00e9thode semble \u00eatre possible sans l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un GAN et est d\u00e9taill\u00e9e dans cet article [3] (https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-based-super-resolution-without-using-a-gan-11c9bb5b6cd5).

Also considering the given time frame it does not seem like the appropriate solution for the short term. \n3 different codes were tested. All three of them based on the GAN method. They allow the use of pre-trained models. These models are generated using databases (via image banks) containing high quality images (HQ) that are voluntarily degraded then used as entries for the generator model. The advantage of testing several codes is to be able to test and generate models from different frameworks. \n",
