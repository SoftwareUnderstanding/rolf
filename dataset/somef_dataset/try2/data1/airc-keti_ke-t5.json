But Frank Smith drives a 6-year-old car with 140,000 miles on it, and paying his senior paralegal minimum wage the last few months has put him in the red. Hoped-for federal grants haven\"t come through, so he\"s had to raise his rates. As of last week he charges $50 an hour minimum instead of $25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation. That\"s in a lawyer\"s market where fees range in the $150 to $250 an hour range in the Ogden area, and up to $400 an hour in the Salt Lake area. Smith\"s one-lawyer foundation basically helps the folks who have too much money to qualify for the federally funded Utah Legal Services, but not enough money to afford a lawyer. \n",

A number of government ministers and backbenchers will have their fortunes changed by the vote, which Prime Minister-elect Turnbull won 54 to 44 on Monday night.
