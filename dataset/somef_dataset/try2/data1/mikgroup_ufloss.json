      "excerpt": "Official github repository for the paper High Fidelity Deep Learning-based MRI Reconstruction with Instance-wise Discriminative Feature Matching Loss. In this work, a novel patch-based Unsupervised Feature loss (UFLoss) is proposed and incorporated into the training of DL-based reconstruction frameworks in order to preserve perceptual similarity and high-order statistics. In-vivo experiments indicate that adding the UFLoss encourages sharper edges with higher overall image quality under DL-based reconstruction framework. Our implementations are in PyTorch \nWe used a subset of FastMRI knee dataset for the training and evaluation. We used E-SPIRiT to pre-compute sensitivity maps using BART. Post-processed data (including Sens Maps, Coil combined images) and pre-trained model can be requested by emailing &#107;&#101;&#119;&#97;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#107;&#101;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;. \nUpdate We provide our data-preprocessing code at UFloss_training/data_preprocessing.py. This script computes the sensitivity maps and performs data normalization and coil combination. BART toolbox is required for computing the sensitivity maps. Follow the installation instructions on the website and add the following lines to your .bashrc file. \n",
