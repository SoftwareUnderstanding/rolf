Comparing to original residual block, shortcut connection was introduced just after the relu activation and an additional batch normalization was added after the shortcut connetction. See in the following image. \nThe shortcut connection between bn of former block and relu activation of current block functioned as filtering mechanism, it can determine which part of features should be emphasized and which part of features should not to be. Detail illustration of modified residual block below.  \n",
