      "excerpt": "Training a model for image-to-image translation typically requires a large dataset of paired examples.These datasets can be difficult and expensive to prepare, and in some cases impossible, such as photographs of paintings by long dead artists. The CycleGAN is a technique that involves the automatic training of image-to-image translation models without paired examples. The models are trained in an unsupervised manner using a collection of images from the source and target domain that do not need to be related in any way.\n\nPix2Pix GAN, a popular image to image translation uses paired images. Paired images dataset is small and hence it is hard to implement object transformation. Cycle GANs use unpaired images for training for image to image transformation.\n\n",
