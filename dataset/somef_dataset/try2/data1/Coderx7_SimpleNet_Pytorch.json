      "excerpt": "This is the pytorch implementation of our architecture SimpleNetV1(2016) .  \nPytorch is different from caffe in several sections, and this made it a bit harder to have the architecture properly ported especially since I'm a complete newbie in Pytorch. However, thanks to this great work, I could easily focus on the model and port the architecture and hopefully achieve my reported results in Caffe and also exceed them as well!  \nThe pytorch implementation is also very effieicent and the whole model takes only 1239MB with the batch size of 64! (compare this to other architectures such as ResNet,WRN, DenseNet which a 800K model takes more than 6G of vram!)  \n",
