      "https://arxiv.org/abs/ [`ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147).\n\n## Packages:\n\n* [train](train) contains tools for training network using various architectures. It can be further used for visulaization of network's performance. This section is mainly for pixelwise segmentation and scene-parsing.\n* [visualize](visualize) can be used to view the performance of trained network on any video/image as an overlay. (Will be added soon)\n\n## Trained model\n\nFind a train model here:\n  + [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dywzk3gyb12hpe5/AAD5YkUa8XgMpHs2gCRgmCVCa)\n  + [Repository release](https://github.com/e-lab/ENet-training/releases/latest)\n\n## Implementation in other frameworks:\n\n* [In Caffe](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/ENet) by [TimoSaemann](https://github.com/TimoSaemann)\n* [In Keras](https://github.com/PavlosMelissinos/enet-keras) by [PavlosMelissinos](https://github.com/PavlosMelissinos)\n\nThank you for your contribution.\nWe have not verified results of the above two implementations but still we feel that researchers working on these different frameworks might find it useful.\n\n### License\n\nThis software is released under a creative commons license which allows for personal and research use only.
