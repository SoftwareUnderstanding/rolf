      "excerpt": "Download the full [MPII Human Pose dataset](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de), and place the `images` directory in `data/mpii`. From there, it is as simple as running `th main.lua -expID test-run` (the experiment ID is arbitrary). To run on [FLIC](http://bensapp.github.io/flic-dataset.html), again place the images in a directory `data/flic/images` then call `th main.lua -dataset flic -expID test-run`.\n\nMost of the command line options are pretty self-explanatory, and can be found in `src/opts.lua`. The `-expID` option will be used to save important information in a directory like `pose-hg-train/exp/mpii/test-run`. This directory will include snapshots of the trained model, training/validations logs with loss and accuracy information, and details of the options set for that particular experiment.\n\n\n",
