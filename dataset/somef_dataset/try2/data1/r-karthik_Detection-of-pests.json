Hence proper care of \n    plants is necessary for same. Image processing provides more efficient ways to detect diseases caused by fungus,  \n    bacteria or virus on plants. Mere observations by eyes to detect diseases are not accurate. Excess use also damages \n    plants nutrient quality. It results in huge loss of production to farmer. Hence use of image processing techniques  \n    to detect and classify diseases in agricultural applications is helpful. \n",
