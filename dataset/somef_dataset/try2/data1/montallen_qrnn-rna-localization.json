QRNNs beat other networks such as LSTM in both accuracy and speed.  \r\nThe followind figure depicts the difference between an LSTM layer and a QRNN layer. The first is totally sequential; the second can be parallelized with convolutions and the sequential part in much lighter.\r\n![layer](https://github.com/AllenMont/qrnn-rna-localization/blob/master/img/layer.PNG)\r\n\r\nA description of QRNNs can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576.
