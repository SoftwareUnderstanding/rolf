      "excerpt": "Deep4Cast is a scalable machine learning package implemented in Python and Torch. It has a front-end API similar to scikit-learn. It is designed for medium to large time series data sets and allows for modeling of forecast uncertainties. \nThe network architecture is based on WaveNet. Regularization and approximate sampling from posterior predictive distributions of forecasts are achieved via Concrete Dropout. \n",
