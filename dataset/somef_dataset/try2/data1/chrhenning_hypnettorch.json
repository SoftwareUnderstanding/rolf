    "excerpt": "Contributing to this repository\nAll contributions and improvements are very welcome and appreciated.\nFirst of all (and most importantly), we only want to have code contributions that follow basic coding guidelines. Our coding is inspired by these guidelines. Here are some basic remarks:\n\nLines should be no longer than 80 characters\nAll names (even local variables) must reflect the meaning of its entity\nAll methods/functions need a docstring describing its purpose, arguments and return values\nIf possible, program object-oriented\nAll changes should be well documented\nWhenever possible, do not copy code\nCommit messages have to be precise, comprehensive and complete\nNever push buggy code to the master repo; be careful to not break other parts of the repo (a good sanity check if always to double-check your changes by running the test suite, but be aware that our tests only cover a small fraction of our code base)\nNever commit any temporary or result files to the repository (output directories of simulations; compiled code or IDE-specific configs). Also, never commit any large files or datasets.\nWhenever you pull from the repo, carefully check all changes made by others, especially in all files that affect your code.\nIf you push third-party code to the repository, make sure that all attributions of copyright-holders are done correctly and the license information is properly incorporated (note, this also holds for code snippets from stackoverflow) \nNever assume that the user knows how to use your program or function. Capture all possible failure modes and provide meaningful warning/error messages.\n\nUse common sense when coding!\n\nThe best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.\n- Donald Ervin Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science\n\nNote, since the repository is changing all the time, code gets deprecated freqeuently. Therefore, please run your python scripts with the option --Wall every once in a while to fix all warnings (especially deprecation warnings).\nDocumentation\nWe follow the Google styleguide when writing docstrings. We use sphinx to build documentation for this project. The documentation source files are located in docs.\nWhen you add your implementation files (containing docstrings) to the documentation source files, make sure the documentation compiles without warnings.\nSee this example on how to write Google-style docstrings in sphinx.\nPlease fix any mistakes and inconsistencies you spot in the documentation.\nCommand-line arguments\nCommand-line argument definitions should be reused whenever possible (see module cli_args). Their help-text should be comprehensive (and ideally contain the default value). Flags should always have the action store_true, such that their usage is intuitive. This rule may only be violated temporarily if a very prominent warning is placed in the code.\nDefault values should never change, especially if other parts of the repo are reusing the argument definition (though, you may capture cases in the definition of a command-line argument to realize different default values for different cases).\nGeneral setup and checkpointing\nFor the general setup of scripts the method setup_environment should be used (see the corresponding docstring). Note, that this method requires some general command-line arguments to be set (see method miscellaneous_args).\nIdeally, networks are regularly checkpointed by using the methods provided in torch_ckpts. Scripts (especially for extensive simulations) should provide the possibility to load and continue from existing checkpoints (such that no computational ressources are wasted).\nData loaders\nA set of framework-agnostic dataloaders is implemented in the folder data. All dataloaders inherit their functionality from the class Dataset.\nThese data loaders are easy to use (and tested with PyTorch and Tensorflow). Most dataloaders simply load the whole dataset in working memory. Some specialized data loaders (e.g., those derived from LargeImgDataset also allow the retrieval of customized data loaders, more suitable for the Deep Learning framework at use.\nThe data loaders in the folder data are only for common datasets. There are several other data loaders (for special datasets, such as synthetic ones) that also inherit from class Dataset which are located in subpackaged of data.\nIf you want to implement you own data handler, just inherit from the abstract class Dataset and specify the fields of the dict attribute _data (there is a short description of all its keys in the constructor of Dataset). Additionally, you have to overwrite the abstract methods get_identifier and _plot_sample.\nMain- and Hypernetworks\nA main network is a network that solves an actual task (specified through a dataset). Hypernetworks are used to generate the parameters of a corresponding main network. Both network types have a dedicated interface. Main networks are located in the folder mnets and have to implement the interface mnet_interface. Hypernetworks are located in the folder hnets and have to implement the special main-net interface hnet_interface. \nPlotting\nIf possible, plots should be produced publication-ready, meaning you should make an effort to make them look nice from the beginning. To ensure consistency, we defined some general guidelines for our plots in the methods configure_matplotlib_params and get_colorbrewer2_colors of the modules misc (e.g., colors, fontsizes, font, ...).",
