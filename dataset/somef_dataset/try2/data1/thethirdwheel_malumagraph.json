      "excerpt": "to determine the strength and type of bouba-kiki effect caused by a particular phoneme.  Right now, we categorize the voicing, openness, \nand position of a phoneme and assign it the given roundness/spikiness (WIP here).  Future work might make this more continuous (and better aligned  \nwith our intuitions) by leveraging Mesgarani's work in phoneme confusion. \nIf we progress from text to waveforms of recorded speech, the work here could help  \nus estimate the bouba-kiki effect size from three waveform characteristics: amplitude, frequency, and spikiness. \nWe use cmudict to transform our input into phonemes in order to calculate the curve shape.  \nTo allow us to handle neologisms and words not in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, we may train a model to predict phonemes. \nWSJ built something to visualize rhyme schemes that I'm interested in leveraging/integrating. \nCMUdict also provides emphasis information, which may be useful for visualizing the rhythms of language and for drawing attention to more apparent sounds. \nThankfully the WSJ project references this work, which provides a handy-dandy syllabification of CMUdict. \nInitially, we just wanted to graph the \"roundness\" of the phonemes, in the order of the provided corpus.  However, it's also interesting to try to use the syllables as the unit of calculation.  We're also interested in applying multipliers based on stress, to emphasize sounds in stressed syllables over unstressed ones.  Breaking things into syllables also seems like it would help with future efforts to incorporate rhyme, assonance, alliteration, and other content of interest. \nI'm developing on a Windows box, which leads to all sorts of nonsense.  One thing is that you can't redirect the stdout output of the cmudict.db from the docker run output to your filesystem and get something that the Dockerfile can pull into the image next time you run docker build.  You'll get the error \"sqlite3.DatabaseError: file is not a database\" if you mess this up.  The way out is to build your docker container and run /bin/bash in it in interactive mode \n",
