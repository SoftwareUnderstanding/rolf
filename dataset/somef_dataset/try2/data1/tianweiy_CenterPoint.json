Check out CenterPoint's model zoo for Waymo and nuScenes.  \n[2020-12-11] 3 out of the top 4 entries in the recent NeurIPS 2020 nuScenes 3D Detection challenge used CenterPoint. Congratualations to other participants and please stay tuned for more updates on nuScenes and Waymo soon. \nThree-dimensional objects are commonly represented as 3D boxes in a point-cloud. This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. CenterPoint achieved state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for both 3D detection and tracking, with 65.5 NDS and 63.8 AMOTA for a single model. On the Waymo Open Dataset, CenterPoint outperforms all previous single model method by a large margin and ranks first among all Lidar-only submissions. \nSimple: Two sentences method summary: We use standard 3D point cloud encoder with a few convolutional layers in the head to produce a bird-eye-view heatmap and other dense regression outputs including the offset to centers in the previous frame. Detection is a simple local peak extraction with refinement, and tracking is a closest-distance matching. \nFast and Accurate: Our best single model achieves 71.9 mAPH on Waymo and 65.5 NDS on nuScenes while running at 11FPS+.  \nExtensible: Simple replacement for anchor-based detector in your novel algorithms. \nONCE_Benchmark: Implementation of CenterPoint on the ONCE dataset  \nCenterPoint-KITTI: Reimplementation of CenterPoint on the KITTI dataset  \n",
