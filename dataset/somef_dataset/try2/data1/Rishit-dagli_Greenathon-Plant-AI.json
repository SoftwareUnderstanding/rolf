We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:\n\nReporting a bug\nDiscussing the current state of the code\nSubmitting a fix\nProposing new features\nBecoming a maintainer\n\nWe Develop with Github\nWe use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.\nWe Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests\nPull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from main.\nIf you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\nIf you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code lints.\nIssue that pull request!\n\nAny contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache 2.0 License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\nReport bugs using Github's issues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!\nWrite bug reports with detail, background, and sample code\nGreat Bug Reports tend to have:\n\nA quick summary and/or background\nSteps to reproduce\nBe specific!\nGive sample code if you can.\nWhat you expected would happen\nWhat actually happens\nNotes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n\nPeople love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.\nLicense\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its Apache 2.0 License.\nReferences\nThis document was adapted from the open-source contribution guidelines for Facebook's Draft",
