Start training the model\n```\n#: To train the model of the Oxford Flowers Dataset\npython3 init.py --mode train -dt flowers\n\n\n#: To train the model of the Stanford Cars Dataset\npython3 init.py --mode train -dt cars\n\n\n#: To train the model of the Dogs Dataset\npython3 init.py --mode train -dt dogs\n```\n\n2. Test the model using pretrained model\n```\npython3 init.py --mode predict -gpath /path/to/pretrained/generator/model.pth\n```\nNote: You can download the pretrained model, the links are available in the readme of the flowers, cars directories under \nresults directories.\n\n",
