      "excerpt": "Many people assume all plastics are recyclable, but this is not necessarily true. Different recycling centers in different areas only process certain types of plastics, while other plastics are directed towards landfill. Misguided waste disposal is problematic because recycling centers process waste in large batches, and if the batch has a certain percentage of non-recyclables, the entire batch is moved over to landfill. Therefore, an improperly recycled item could cause correctly recycled waste to end up in landfill.\n",
