      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948\n\nI scraped Fauvism art from WikiArt as the basis of this model, as it's a distinct, fun style with bold colors and thick lines of paint--perfect for experimentation.  I also used Google Colab notebook for this project; it's a first--I wanted to learn how Google Colab functions, and what can be done with it.\n\n#### This project is currently being trained; I am finalizing the quality of the artwork.  In the meantime, the Sample Images folder contains snapshots of the training in progess.
