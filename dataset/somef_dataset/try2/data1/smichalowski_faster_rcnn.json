Both networks are trained for sharing convolutional layers for fast testing.\n\n**This repo contains a Python implementation of Faster-RCNN originally developed in Matlab.\nThis code works with models trained using Matlab version of Faster-RCNN which is main difference between this and py-faster-rcnn.**\n\nThis code was developed for internal use in one of my projects at the end of 2015. I decided to publish it as is.\n\n",
