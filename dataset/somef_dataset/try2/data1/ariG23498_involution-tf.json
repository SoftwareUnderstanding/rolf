In this reporsitory you will find a jupyter notebook that houses the involution layer. \nI have also tried training a classifier on CIFAR10 from scratch wtih convolutions and involutions. The loss plots, accuracy plots and the size of the models are quite astonishing. While convs outperform invs, we need to keep in mind the amount of parameters for invs. \n",
