Current datasets are collected from three open-source environments, i.e., CityLearn, FinRL, IB, and three Gym-MuJoCo tasks. We use SAC to train on each domain, and then use policies around 25%, 50% and 75% of the highest episode return to generate three-level quality of datasets respectively for each task. Since the action spaces of these domains are continuous, the policy output is the mean and stdev of a Gaussian distribution. During data collection, with 80% chance we take the mean of the Gaussian policy and with 20% probaility to sample from the trained policies to reflect the mistakes of human operators in real-world systems. The entire datasets can be reproduced with this repo.   \n",
