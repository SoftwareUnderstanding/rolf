      "excerpt": "In both TensorFlow implementations, net[0] means prev and net[1] means prev_prev. However, in the PyTorch implementation, states[0] means prev_prev and states[1] means prev. I followed the PyTorch implemetation in this repository. This is why the 0 and 1 in PNASCell specification are reversed. \nThe default value of eps in BatchNorm layers is 1e-3 in TensorFlow and 1e-5 in PyTorch. I changed all BatchNorm eps values to 1e-3 (see operations.py) to exactly match the TensorFlow pretrained model. \nThe TensorFlow pretrained model uses tf.image.resize_bilinear to resize the image (see utils.py). I cannot find a python function that exactly matches this function's behavior (also see this thread and this post on this topic), so currently in main.py I call TensorFlow to do the image preprocessing, in order to guarantee both models have the identical input. \nWhen converting the model from TensorFlow to PyTorch (i.e. convert.py), I use input image size of 323 instead of 331. This is because the 'SAME' padding in TensorFlow may differ from padding in PyTorch in some layers (see this link; basically TF may only pad 1 right and bottom, whereas PyTorch always pads 1 for all four margins). However, they behave exactly the same when image size is 323: conv0 does not have padding, so feature size becomes 161, then 81, 41, etc. \nThe exact conversion when image size is 323 is also corroborated by the following table: \nImage Size | Official TensorFlow Model | Converted PyTorch Model \n",
