      "excerpt": "based on paper, Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition He et al.2015 \nThe Resnet is similar to a convolutional neural network with a 'shortcut'. A shortcut is a path that goes through a group of convolutional layers, directly allowing the input to pass to the output. This creates a stablizing effect similar to an anchor, by supporting the parameters across deep networks, preventing degradation. Resnets allows for generalization to increase with layer depth. \nRan on Cifar10 and Caltech256 datasets \nThe files in this repository include: \n",
