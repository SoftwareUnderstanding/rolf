For example, often it's helpful to experiment inside a Jupyter Notebook, like in the example workflow below.\n\n  First, configure your GAN to your choosing on the command-line (like explained above under the \"Basic Usage on Command-line\" section):\n  ~~~\n  $ python config.py stylegan\n  $ python data_config.py FFHQ path/to/datasets/ffhq\n  ~~~\n\n  Then, write a custom script or Jupyter Notebook cells:\n  ```python\n  from gan_lab import get_current_configuration\n  from gan_lab.utils.data_utils import prepare_dataset, prepare_dataloader\n  from gan_lab.stylegan.learner import StyleGANLearner\n\n  #: get most recent configurations:\n  config = get_current_configuration( 'config' )\n  data_config = get_current_configuration( 'data_config' )\n\n  #: get DataLoader(s)\n  train_ds, valid_ds = prepare_dataset( data_config )\n  train_dl, valid_dl, z_valid_dl = prepare_dataloader( config, data_config, train_ds, valid_ds )\n\n  #: instantiate StyleGANLearner and train:\n  learner = StyleGANLearner( config )\n  learner.train( train_dl, valid_dl, z_valid_dl )   #: train for config.num_main_iters iterations\n  learner.config.num_main_iters = 300000            #: this is one example of changing your instantiated learner's configurations\n  learner.train( train_dl, valid_dl, z_valid_dl )   #: train for another 300000 iterations\n\n  #: save your trained model:\n  learner.save_model( 'path/to/models/stylegan_model.tar' )\n\n  #: later on, you can load this saved model by instantiating the same learner and then running load_model:\n  #: learner = StyleGANLearner( config )\n  #: learner.load_model( 'path/to/models/stylegan_model.tar' )\n  ```\n\n__Some Advantages of Jupyter Notebook (there are many more than this)__:\n+ You have the flexibility to think about what to do with your trained model after its trained rather than all at once, such as:\n  + whether you want to save/load your trained model\n  + what learner.config parameters you want to change before training again\n+ You can always stop the kernel during training, do something else, and then resume again and it will work\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n__NOTE__ that by default, the _--num_workers_ argument in [config.py](./gan_lab/config.py) is set to data-loading from just 1 subprocess; setting this to a larger number (that still falls within the constraints of your CPU(s)) will speed up training significantly. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n",
