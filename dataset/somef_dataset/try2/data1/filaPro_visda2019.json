No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License\\n            constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or\\n            imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed\\n            Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\\n            granted official status by, the Licensor or others\\n            designated to receive attribution as provided in Section\\n            3(a)(1)(A)(i).\\n    -   b. Other rights.\\n        -   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\\n            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\\n            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\\n            to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees\\n            not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\\n            limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the\\n            Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\\n        -   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\\n            Public License.\\n        -   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\\n            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\\n            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\\n            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\\n            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\\n            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\\n            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\\n            purposes.\\n\\n-   Section 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 License Conditions.\\n\\n    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to\\n    the following conditions.\\n\\n    -   a.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may\\n            be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI\\n            or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n            information.\\n        -   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n            reasonably practicable.\\n\\n-   Section 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\n    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\n    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n    -   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the\\n        right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a\\n        substantial portion of the contents of the database for\\n        NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share\\n        Adapted Material;\\n    -   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;\\n        and\\n    -   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You\\n        Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the\\n        database.\\n\\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\n    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the\\n    Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n-   Section 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n    -   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to\\n        the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material\\n        as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or\\n        warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether\\n        express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without\\n        limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a\\n        particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\\n        defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether\\n        or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties\\n        are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not\\n        apply to You.\\n    -   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be\\n        liable to You on any legal theory (including, without\\n        limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,\\n        indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or\\n        other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\\n        Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the\\n        Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,\\n        costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is\\n        not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to\\n        You.\\n    -   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability\\n        provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the\\n        extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute\\n        disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\\n\\n-   Section 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Term and Termination.\\n\\n    -   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply\\n        with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public\\n        License terminate automatically.\\n    -   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated\\n        under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n        -   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured,\\n            provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n            violation; or\\n        -   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect\\n        any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your\\n        violations of this Public License.\\n\\n    -   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing\\n        so will not terminate this Public License.\\n    -   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n        License.\\n\\n-   Section 7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n    -   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or\\n        different terms or conditions communicated by You unless\\n        expressly agreed.\\n    -   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n-   Section 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Interpretation.\\n\\n    -   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could\\n        lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\\n    -   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public\\n        License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically\\n        reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\\n        If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from\\n        this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the\\n        remaining terms and conditions.\\n    -   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived\\n        and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to\\n        by the Licensor.\\n    -   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be\\n        interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges\\n        and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from\\n        the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
