      "excerpt": "* neither of the used image downsampling methods is \"buggy\", not applying antialiasing by default is an understandable design decision for both image and tensor operations. \n* the main figure of the paper is misleading, and it only illustrates the issues of aliasing for image resizing. \n* the aliasing issue with downsampling can be solved in all frameworks by simply setting a few parameters correctly. My criticism is that this is not mentioned in the paper. \n* torchvision.transforms.Resize() is claimed to only be a \"a wrapper around the PIL library\" in a note in Section 3.2 of the paper. This is true for PIL image inputs, but is incorrect for torch.Tensors, which are resized using torchvision interpolation operations. \n* the remaining parts of the paper provide valuable insights into the effects of interpolation methods, quantization and compression on the FID score of generative models. \nUpdate: Just found out that there is another, very thorough investigation of the same issue. Highly recommend checking the blogpost out. They also implement an OpenCV-compatible Pillow-equivalent resizing that provides proper antialiasing for all interpolations. \nBilinear downsampling results with and without aliasing: \n",
