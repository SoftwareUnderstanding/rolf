      "excerpt": "The generalization of representations learned via contrastive learning depends crucially on  what features of the data are extracted. However, we observe that the contrastive loss does not always sufficiently guide which features are extracted, a behavior that can negatively impact the performance on downstream tasks via \"shortcuts\", i.e., by inadvertently suppressing important predictive features. We find that feature extraction is influenced by the difficulty of the so-called instance discrimination task (i.e., the task of discriminating pairs of similar points from pairs of dissimilar ones). Although harder pairs improve the representation of some features, the improvement comes at the cost of suppressing previously well represented features. In response, we propose implicit feature modification (IFM), a method for altering positive and negative samples in order to guide contrastive models towards capturing a wider variety of predictive features. Empirically, we observe that IFM reduces feature suppression, and as a result improves performance on vision and medical imaging tasks. \n",

      "excerpt": "An ideal encoder would  discriminate between instances using multiple distinguishing features instead of finding simple shortcuts that suppress features. We show that InfoNCE-trained encoders can suppress features (Sec. 2.2). However, making instance discrimination harder during training can trade off representation of different features (Sec. 2.3). To avoid the need for trade-offs we propose implicit feature modification (Sec. 3), which reduces suppression in general, and improves generalization (Sec. 4).  \n",
