      "excerpt": "The end goal of this project is to try and get the area of leaves from a picture. To do this, the part of the image that is the plant needs to be segmented from the background. There are many ways to do image segmentation such as thresholding the RGB values or using clustering to find patches of similar color, both of which are often paired with edge detection methods to try and find the edges of objects and only keep the pixels that are of interest. However, these methods are sensitive to different lighting conditions and often require color space transformations from RGB to HSV in order to be robust. These methods also don't determine which class the foreground of the image is a part of. However, with a segmentation neural network, there would not have to be any color space transformation of the image and it would output predictions for each class in the foreground that it was told to try and predict.\n\nOnce the image is segmented, an estimation of the leaf area could be produced by properly scaling the proportion of the image that contains the desired class to some reference object that has known dimensions. Since there are no reference objects in this data set, the goal for this project would be to get the proportion of each class in the image.\n\n",

      "excerpt": "The data set consists of images of corn, wheat, and mung beans and their segmented labels. The segmented labels are of the same 2-D shape as the images, but the pixel values are either 0 if they are part of the class in the foreground and are 100 if they belong to the background. These labels were generated through some software package that likely uses the segmentation methods discussed earlier. This means that the labels are not perfectly accurate and do misclassify some of the pixels in the images. Because of this, the models produced with this data will not be as accurate as they could be.\n\nThe images in this data set consisted of a variety of sizes and were quite large. To standardize the data, the images were cut into 256 x 256 pixel pieces. When the images were loaded into memory and trained, they were normalized so that all of the pixel values were between 0 and 1.  \n\n",
