      "excerpt": "This project trains different Convolutional Neural Network model architectures using street house digit images in the Stanford SVHN dataset to detect the correct house address number in real life images and the location of the house address in an image (both the correct digits and also the correct sequencing of digits: For example: it can successfully differentiate between 1234 Main Street vs 1243 Main Street). \n\nThe model is trained on 150K+ unique images total with data augmented through random rotations and shifts to help results be more robust to location, lighting, orientation and scale. After training a sliding window (but originally a gaussian pyramid approach) is used to detect the exact location of a number in an image in addition to the number itself\n\nCNN Model architectures were based on the folloiwng academic papers:\n\n1) `Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nIan J. Goodfellow, Yaroslav Bulatov, Julian Ibarz, Sacha Arnoud, Vinay Shet`\n(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6082.pdf)\n\n2) `VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION \nKaren Simonyan & Andrew Zisserman + Visual Geometry Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford` (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)\n\nTh Goodfellow paper performs slightly better coming at around 92% all digit accuracy (with the worst digit number no less than 95% accuracy). To showcase performance of classifier under different viewing conditions a short video has been uploaded on youtube for reference:<br/>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ln-Tg_ou5iU\n\nResults are also summarized in report.pdf for reference.\n\n",
