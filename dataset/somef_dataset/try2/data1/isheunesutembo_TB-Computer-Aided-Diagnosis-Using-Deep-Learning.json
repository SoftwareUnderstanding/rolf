      "excerpt": "<p>According to Who about a quarter of the world's population is infected by TB bacteria  and a small proportion of those infected will become sick with TB.WHO aims at reducing TB deaths by 90% and to cut new cases to 80% between 2015 and 2030 ,therefore they is need for automated systems to help doctors detect TB from chest X-ray images. The computer aided system uses is a resnet50 model which was trained from TB x-ray and deployed to a flask api. The model has an accuracy of 81% which is not bad considering the data used was little. Convolutional Neural Networks are good at identifying patterns thus can learn how to distiguish between TB infected X-ray images and not infected. </p> \n",
