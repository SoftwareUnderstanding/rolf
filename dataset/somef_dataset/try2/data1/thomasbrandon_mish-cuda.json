In terms of speed of the function it is fairly comparable with other PyTorch activation functions and significantly faster than the pure PyTorch implementation: \n",

      "excerpt": "It is currently distributed as a source only PyTorch extension. So you need a propely set up toolchain and CUDA compilers to install.\n1) _Toolchain_ - In conda the `cxx_linux-64` package provides an appropriate toolchain. However there can still be compatbility issues with this depending on system. You can also try with the system toolchian.\n2) _CUDA Toolkit_ - The [nVidia CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) is required in addition to drivers to provide needed headers and tools. Get the appropriate version for your Linux distro from nVidia or check for distro specific instructions otherwise.\n\n_It is important your CUDA Toolkit matches the version PyTorch is built for or errors can occur. Currently PyTorch builds for v10.0 and v9.2._\n\n",
