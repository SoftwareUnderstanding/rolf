By default, the notebook uses the [hosted demo instance](http://max-question-answering.max.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud), but you can use a locally running instance as well. _Note_ the demo requires `jupyter`, `pprint`, `json` and `requests`.\r\n\r\nRun the following command from the model repo base folder, in a new terminal window:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jupyter notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start the notebook server. You can launch the demo notebook by clicking on `samples/demo.ipynb`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
