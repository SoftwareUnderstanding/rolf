It is\na part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.\n\nThe master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Major features</summary>\n\n- **Modular Design**\n\n  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.\n\n- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**\n\n  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.\n\n- **High efficiency**\n\n  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).\n\n- **State of the art**\n\n  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.\n</details>\n\n\nApart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.\n\n",

        "body": "#### Highlights\r\n\r\n- Support new methods: [AutoAssign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03496), [YOLOF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09460), and [Deformable DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159)\r\n- Stable support of exporting models to ONNX with batched images and dynamic shape (#5039)\r\n\r\n#### Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\nMMDetection is going through big refactoring for more general and convenient usages during the releases from v2.12.0 to v2.15.0 (maybe longer).\r\nIn v2.12.0 MMDetection inevitably brings some BC-breakings including the MMCV dependency, model initialization, model registry, and mask AP evaluation.\r\n\r\n- MMCV version. MMDetection v2.12.0 relies on the newest features in MMCV 1.3.3, including `BaseModule` for unified parameter initialization, model registry, and the CUDA operator `MultiScaleDeformableAttn` for [Deformable DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159). Note that MMCV 1.3.2 already contains all the features used by MMDet but has known issues. Therefore, we recommend users to skip MMCV v1.3.2 and use v1.3.2, though v1.3.2 might work for most of the cases.\r\n- Unified model initialization (#4750). To unify the parameter initialization in OpenMMLab projects, MMCV supports `BaseModule` that accepts `init_cfg` to allow the modules' parameters to be initialized in a flexible and unified manner. Now the users need to explicitly call `model.init_weights()` in the training script to initialize the model (as in [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/tools/train.py#L162), previously this was handled by the detector. The models in MMDetection have been re-benchmarked to ensure accuracy in PR #4750. **The downstream projects should update their code accordingly to use MMDetection v2.12.0**.\r\n- Unified model registry (#5059). To easily use backbones implemented in other OpenMMLab projects, MMDetection migrates to inherit the model registry created in MMCV (#760). In this way, as long as the backbone is supported in an OpenMMLab project and that project also uses the registry in MMCV, users can use that backbone in MMDetection by simply modifying the config without copying the code of that backbone into MMDetection.\r\n- Mask AP evaluation (#4898). In the previous version, the areas of masks are calculated through the bounding boxes when calculating the mask AP of small, medium, and large instances. To really use the area of masks, we pop the key `bbox` during mask AP calculation. This change does not affect the overall mask AP evaluation and aligns the mask AP of similar models in other repos like Detectron2.\r\n\r\n#### New Features\r\n\r\n- Support paper [AutoAssign: Differentiable Label Assignment for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03496) (#4295)\r\n- Support paper [You Only Look One-level Feature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09460) (#4295)\r\n- Support paper [Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) (#4778)\r\n- Support calculating IoU with FP16 tensor in `bbox_overlaps` to save memory and keep speed (#4889)\r\n- Add `__repr__` in custom dataset to count the number of instances (#4756)\r\n- Add windows support by updating requirements.txt (#5052)\r\n- Stable support of exporting models to ONNX with batched images and dynamic shape, including SSD, FSAF, FCOS, YOLOv3, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN (#5039)\r\n\r\n#### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Use MMCV `MODEL_REGISTRY` (#5059)\r\n- Unified parameter initialization for more flexible usage (#4750)\r\n- Rename variable names and fix docstring in anchor head (#4883)\r\n- Support training with empty GT in Cascade RPN (#4928)\r\n- Add more details of usage of `test_robustness` in documentation (#4917)\r\n- Changing to use `pycocotools` instead of `mmpycocotools` to fully support Detectron2 and MMDetection in one environment (#4939)\r\n- Update torch serve dockerfile to support dockers of more versions (#4954)\r\n- Add check for training with the single class dataset (#4973)\r\n- Refactor transformer and DETR Head (#4763)\r\n- Update FPG model zoo (#5079)\r\n- More accurate mask AP of small/medium/large instances (#4898)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix bug in mean_ap.py when calculating mAP by 11 points (#4875)\r\n- Fix error when key `meta` is not in old checkpoints (#4936)\r\n- Fix hanging bug when training with empty GT in VFNet, GFL, and FCOS by changing the place of `reduce_mean` (#4923, #4978, #5058)\r\n- Fix asyncronized inference error and provide related demo (#4941)\r\n- Fix IoU losses dimensionality unmatch error (#4982)\r\n- Fix torch.randperm whtn using PyTorch 1.8 (#5014)\r\n- Fix empty bbox error in `mask_head` when using CARAFE (#5062)\r\n- Fix `supplement_mask` bug when there are zero-size RoIs (#5065)\r\n- Fix testing with empty rois in RoI Heads (#5081)\r\n\r\n### New Contributors\r\n* @ZephyrusKylin made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4875\r\n* @agim-a made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4936\r\n* @li-phone made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4889\r\n* @Adamdad made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4756\r\n* @hjin2902 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4943\r\n* @adursun made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/5013\r\n* @quincylin1 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/5031\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/compare/v2.11.0...v2.12.0",

(#3766, #3822)**\r\nMixed precision training utils in `mmdet.core.fp16` are moved to `mmcv.runner`, including `force_fp32`, `auto_fp16`, `wrap_fp16_model`, and `Fp16OptimizerHook`. A deprecation warning will be raised if users attempt to import those methods from `mmdet.core.fp16`, and will be finally removed in V2.8.0.\r\n\r\n**[0, N-1] represents foreground classes and N indicates background classes for all models. (#3221)**\r\nBefore v2.5.0, the background label for RPN is 0, and N for other heads. Now the behavior is consistent for all models. Thus `self.background_labels` in `dense_heads` is removed and all heads use `self.num_classes` to indicate the class index of background labels.\r\nThis change has no effect on the pre-trained models in the v2.x model zoo, but will affect the training of all models with RPN heads. Two-stage detectors whose RPN head uses softmax will be affected because the order of categories is changed.\r\n\r\n**Only call `get_subset_by_classes` when `test_mode=True` and `self.filter_empty_gt=True` (#3695)**\r\nFunction `get_subset_by_classes` in dataset is refactored and only filters out images when `test_mode=True` and `self.filter_empty_gt=True`.\r\n    In the original implementation, `get_subset_by_classes` is not related to the flag `self.filter_empty_gt` and will only be called when the classes is set during initialization no matter `test_mode` is `True` or `False`. This brings ambiguous behavior and potential bugs in many cases. After v2.5.0, if `filter_empty_gt=False`, no matter whether the classes are specified in a dataset, the dataset will use all the images in the annotations. If `filter_empty_gt=True` and `test_mode=True`, no matter whether the classes are specified, the dataset will call ``get_subset_by_classes` to check the images and filter out images containing no GT boxes. Therefore, the users should be responsible for the data filtering/cleaning process for the test dataset.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- Test time augmentation for single stage detectors (#3844, #3638)\r\n- Support to show the name of experiments during training (#3764)\r\n- Add `Shear`, `Rotate`, `Translate` Augmentation (#3656, #3619, #3687)\r\n- Add image-only transformations including `Constrast`, `Equalize`, `Color`, and `Brightness`.

        "body": "## Highlights\r\n- Fix lots of issues/bugs and reorganize the trouble shooting page\r\n- Support new methods [SABL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04260), [YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767), and [PAA Assign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08103)\r\n- Support Batch Inference\r\n- Start to publish `mmdet` package to PyPI since v2.3.0\r\n- Switch model zoo to download.openmmlab.com\r\n\r\n## Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n- Support Batch Inference (#3564, #3686, #3705): Since v2.4.0, MMDetection could inference model with multiple images in a single GPU.\r\nThis change influences all the test APIs in MMDetection and downstream codebases. To help the users migrate their code, we use `replace_ImageToTensor` (#3686) to convert legacy test data pipelines during dataset initialization.\r\n- Support RandomFlip with horizontal/vertical/diagonal direction (#3608): Since v2.4.0, MMDetection supports horizontal/vertical/diagonal flip in the data augmentation. This influences bounding box, mask, and image transformations in data augmentation process and the process that will map those data back to the original format.\r\n- Migrate to use `mmlvis` and `mmpycocotools` for COCO and LVIS dataset (#3727). The APIs are fully compatible with the original `lvis` and `pycocotools`. Users need to uninstall the existing pycocotools and lvis packages in their environment first and install `mmlvis` & `mmpycocotools`.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix default mean/std for onnx (#3491)\r\n- Fix coco evaluation and add metric items (#3497)\r\n- Fix typo for install.md (#3516)\r\n- Fix atss when sampler per gpu is 1 (#3528)\r\n- Fix import of fuse_conv_bn (#3529)\r\n- Fix bug of gaussian_target, update unittest of heatmap (#3543)\r\n- Fixed VOC2012 evaluate (#3553)\r\n- Fix scale factor bug of rescale (#3566)\r\n- Fix with_xxx_attributes in base detector (#3567)\r\n- Fix boxes scaling when number is 0 (#3575)\r\n- Fix rfp check when neck config is a list (#3591)\r\n- Fix import of fuse conv bn in benchmark.py (#3606)\r\n- Fix webcam demo (#3634)\r\n- Fix typo and itemize issues in tutorial (#3658)\r\n- Fix error in distributed training when some levels of FPN are not assigned with bounding boxes (#3670)\r\n- Fix the width and height orders of stride in valid flag generation (#3685)\r\n- Fix weight initialization bug in Res2Net DCN (#3714)\r\n- Fix bug in OHEMSampler (#3677)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Support Cutout augmentation (#3521)\r\n- Support evaluation on multiple datasets through ConcatDataset (#3522)\r\n- Support [PAA assign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08103) #(3547)\r\n- Support eval metric with pickle results (#3607)\r\n- Support [YOLOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767) (#3083)\r\n- Support [SABL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04260) (#3603)\r\n- Support to publish to Pypi in github-action (#3510)\r\n- Support custom imports (#3641)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Refactor common issues in documentation (#3530)\r\n- Add pytorch 1.6 to CI config (#3532)\r\n- Add config to runner meta (#3534)\r\n- Add eval-option flag for testing (#3537)\r\n- Add init_eval to evaluation hook (#3550)\r\n- Add include_bkg in ClassBalancedDataset (#3577)\r\n- Using config's loading in inference_detector (#3611)\r\n- Add ATSS ResNet-101 models in model zoo (#3639)\r\n- Update urls to download.openmmlab.com (#3665)\r\n- Support non-mask training for CocoDataset (#3711)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @asuith made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/3516\r\n* @mprzewie made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/3575\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0",
