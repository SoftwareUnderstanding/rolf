For an archived list of updates,\ncheck out [NEWS.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/NEWS.md).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"90%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/main/docs/source/_static/img/parlai_example.png\" /></p>\n\n## Interactive Tutorial\n\nFor those who want to start with ParlAI now, you can try our [Colab Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bRMvN0lGXaTF5fuTidgvlAl-Lb41F7AD#scrollTo=KtVz5dCUmFkN).\n\n## Installing ParlAI\n\nParlAI currently requires Python3.7+ and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) 1.6 or higher.\nDependencies of the core modules are listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/requirements.txt). Some\nmodels included (in [`parlai/agents`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/agents)) have additional requirements.\nWe *strongly* recommend you install ParlAI in a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment.\n\nWe do not support Windows at this time, but many users [report success on Windows using Python 3.8](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/issues/3989) and issues with Python 3.9. We are happy to accept patches that improve Windows support.\n\n**Standard Installation**\n\nIf you want to use ParlAI without modifications, you can install it with:\n\n```bash\npip install parlai\n```\n\n**Development Installation**\n\nMany users will want to modify some parts of ParlAI. To set up a development\nenvironment, run the following commands to clone the repository and install\nParlAI:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI.git ~/ParlAI\ncd ~/ParlAI; python setup.py develop\n```\n\nAll needed data will be downloaded to `~/ParlAI/data`. If you need to clear out\nthe space used by these files, you can safely delete these directories and any\nfiles needed will be downloaded again.\n\n## Documentation\n\n - [Quick Start](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_quick.html)\n - [Basics: world, agents, teachers, action and observations](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_basic.html)\n - [Creating a new dataset/task](http://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_task.html)\n - [List of available tasks/datasets](https://parl.ai/docs/tasks.html)\n - [Creating a seq2seq agent](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_torch_generator_agent.html)\n - [List of available agents](https://parl.ai/docs/agents_list.html)\n - [Model zoo (list pretrained models)](https://parl.ai/docs/zoo.html)\n - [Running crowdsourcing tasks](http://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_crowdsourcing.html)\n - [Plug into Facebook Messenger](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_chat_service.html)\n\n\n## Examples\n\nA large set of scripts can be found in [`parlai/scripts`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/scripts). Here are a few of them.\nNote: If any of these examples fail, check the [installation section](#installing-parlai) to see if you have missed something.\n\nDisplay 10 random examples from the SQuAD task\n```bash\nparlai display_data -t squad\n```\n\nEvaluate an IR baseline model on the validation set of the Personachat task:\n```bash\nparlai eval_model -m ir_baseline -t personachat -dt valid\n```\n\nTrain a single layer transformer on PersonaChat (requires pytorch and torchtext).\nDetail: embedding size 300, 4 attention heads,  2 epochs using batchsize 64, word vectors are initialized with fasttext and the other elements of the batch are used as negative during training.\n```bash\nparlai train_model -t personachat -m transformer/ranker -mf /tmp/model_tr6 --n-layers 1 --embedding-size 300 --ffn-size 600 --n-heads 4 --num-epochs 2 -veps 0.25 -bs 64 -lr 0.001 --dropout 0.1 --embedding-type fasttext_cc --candidates batch\n```\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe code is set up into several main directories:\n\n- [**core**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/core): contains the primary code for the framework\n- [**agents**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/agents): contains agents which can interact with the different tasks (e.g. machine learning models)\n- [**scripts**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/scripts): contains a number of useful scripts, like training, evaluating, interactive chatting, ...\n- [**tasks**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/tasks): contains code for the different tasks available from within ParlAI\n- [**mturk**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/mturk): contains code for setting up Mechanical Turk, as well as sample MTurk tasks\n- [**messenger**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/chat_service/services/messenger): contains code for interfacing with Facebook Messenger\n- [**utils**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/utils): contains a wide number of frequently used utility methods\n- [**crowdsourcing**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/crowdsourcing): contains code for running crowdsourcing tasks, such as on Amazon Mechanical Turk\n- [**chat_service**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/chat_service/services/messenger): contains code for interfacing with services such as Facebook Messenger\n- [**zoo**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/zoo): contains code to directly download and use pretrained models from our model zoo\n\n## Support\nIf you have any questions, bug reports or feature requests, please don't hesitate to post on our [Github Issues page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/issues).\nYou may also be interested in checking out our [FAQ](https://parl.ai/docs/faq.html) and\nour [Tips n Tricks](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_tipsntricks.html).\n\nPlease remember to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome PRs from the community!\n\nYou can find information about contributing to ParlAI in our\n[Contributing](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\ndocument.\n\n\n## The Team\nParlAI is currently maintained by Moya Chen, Emily Dinan, Dexter Ju, Mojtaba\nKomeili, Spencer Poff, Pratik Ringshia, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster,\nEric Michael Smith, Megan Ung, Jack Urbanek, Jason Weston, Mary Williamson,\nand Jing Xu.

For purposes of this Public License,\\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\\n\\n       5. Downstream recipients.\\n\\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\\n               Public License.\\n\\n            b. No downstream restrictions.

No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\\n\\n  b. Other rights.\\n\\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\\n\\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\\n          Public License.\\n\\n       3.

Attribution.\\n\\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\\n          form), You must:\\n\\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\\n               with the Licensed Material:\\n\\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\\n                    designated);\\n\\n                ii. a copyright notice;\\n\\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\\n\\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\\n                    warranties;\\n\\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\\n\\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\\n\\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\\n\\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\\'s\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\\n     only;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

(#3792, #3800, #3814)\r\n\r\n### Multi-Session Chat\r\n\r\nBuild and release a dataset of [multi-session chats](https://parl.ai/projects/msc/) for the purpose of studying long-term open-domain conversation. Models trained on the dataset prove to perform better at recalling information from the distant past in the chats. (#3791, #3799, #3814)\r\n\r\n### Safety Benchmark Tests\r\n\r\nWith the release of [Anticipating Safety Issues in E2E Conversational AI: Framework and Tooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03451), ParlAI now supports running safety unit tests for conversational models. Check out [the project page](https://parl.ai/projects/safety_bench/) to see how to run the safety benchmarks. (#3767, #3768, #3769, #3784)\r\n\r\n### Convenience Functions for Agents\r\n\r\nWith a recent update to ParlAI's agent API, you can now bypass the act/observe loop for interacting with agents. (#3775)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: from parlai.core.agents import create_agent\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from parlai.core.params import ParlaiParser\r\n\r\nIn [3]: opt = ParlaiParser(True, True).parse_args(['--model_file', 'zoo:blender/blender_90M/model'])\r\n\r\nIn [4]: agent = create_agent(opt)\r\n\r\nIn [5]: agent.respond(\"Hi!

Improves training speed and reduces memory usage over vanilla DistributedDataParallel. Switch to the new mode with `--ddp-backend zero2` to see free improvements in your training! (#3740)\r\n\r\n### Swappable Transformer Components\r\n\r\nWe've added support for overriding [internal components within Transformers](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_swap_components.html). It is now easy to swap only an attention module, or customize your layers, without having to fully override all classes. (#3567, #3703, #3708, #3715, #3638)\r\n\r\n### ChunkTeacher no longer requires num_examples/num_episodes to be correct\r\n\r\nFor as long as we've had ChunkTeacher, the value of `num_examples/num_episodes` must be exactly correct, or your training would hang. Furthermore, that calculation would need to be done outside of ParlAI. We've relaxed this restriction: these methods can now return arbitrary values, and you will correctly iterate through all of your data. However, using the wrong value of `num_examples` can cause the \"epoch\" counter (used in `parlai train`) to be wrong relative to your dataset. (#3681, #3745)\r\n\r\n### Eliminate dummy batches and init_cuda_buffer\r\n\r\nYou are no longer required to implement dummy batches in your Generator agents, when using custom batch formats. Additionally, you will no longer see a dummy batch as the first batch when debugging. Instead, the first batch your agent sees will be reserved as the future dummy batch. (#3732, #3744)\r\n\r\n## Paper Releases\r\n\r\n### Reducing Hallucination\r\n\r\nExploratory architectures that add [retrieval mechanisms to dialogue models](https://parl.ai/projects/hallucination/), reducing hallucination while maintaining conversational ability. (#3611, #3657, #3693, #3688, #3668)\r\n\r\n### Hash Layers & Ladder Transformers\r\n\r\n[More Parameters or More Compute?](https://parl.ai/projects/params_vs_compute) Answer: Both! Two new methods that explore this question: Hash Layers for more parameters, and Staircase Attention for more power per parameter.

If you have any questions about upgrading, please make sure to [check the new tutorial](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_crowdsourcing.html) and feel free to ask questions in our new [Discussions forum](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/discussions)\r\n\r\n### New discussions forum\r\n\r\nWe've enabled [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/discussions) as a new place for individuals to ask more long-lived questions. We still encourage using issues for bug reports, but many \"How do I...?\" questions are better for Discussions now.\r\n\r\n### Distilled models\r\n\r\nWe have released several distilled BlenderBot models (#3313, #3314), as well as code for distilling your own models. See [project page](https://parl.ai/projects/anti_scaling/).\r\n\r\n### DECODE model releases\r\n\r\nNew project on addressing contradictions in dialogue models (#3324, #3325, #3327, #3334, #3309). See [project page](https://parl.ai/projects/contradiction/) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Backwards incompatible changes\r\n\r\n* `parlai.mturk` has been removed in favor of `parlai.crowdsourcing` (#3362, #3371)\r\n* The API for `add_cmdline_args` has changed. Please see the PR for information on upgrading. This enables things like defaults that depend on other values, or arguments that depend on other arguments. (#3328)\r\n* Improvements to world logger arguments (#3380)\r\n\r\n## New features in core\r\n\r\n* New distinct metrics (including intra-distinct and inter-distinct). (#3347)\r\n* 40% Speedups in `--model-parallel true` generations and training (#3326)\r\n* Updated README, autodoc descriptions, PR templates (#3359, #3342, #3345, #3322))\r\n* [developer] Many more task regression tests (#3240)\r\n\r\n## New features in crowdsourcing\r\n\r\n* General improvements to ACUTE-Eval implementation, docs, and introduction of analysis framework (#3374, #3333, #3344, #3305, #3323)\r\n* Conversion of turn annotations to Mephisto (#3262, #3356)\r\n* Mephisto QA data collection (#3318, #3330)\r\n* Mephisto image-chat task (#3320)\r\n* Documentation improvements (#3319, #3373)\r\n* Fixing flaky tests (#3363, #3372, #3321, #3355)\r\n\r\n## Smaller bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Allow differing arguments for  dynamic batching in eval/train (#3382)\r\n* fix: deprecated argument when calling transformers>4.0.0 (#3393)\r\n* Small bugs with crowdsourcing (#3346, #3386, #3387)\r\n* Fix a misparse of `-o` (#3347)\r\n* Fix bert models in distributed.
