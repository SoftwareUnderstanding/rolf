      "excerpt": "Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.  \nFollowing the original NST paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we will use the VGG network. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). \nThe model is stored in a python dictionary where each variable name is the key and the corresponding value is a tensor containing that variable's value. To run an image through this network, we just have to feed the image to the model. In TensorFlow, we can do so using the tf.assign function. In particular, we will use the assign function like this: \n",
