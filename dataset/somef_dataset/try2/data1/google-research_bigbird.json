Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle. \nAs a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, \nBigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. \nMore details and comparisons can be found in our presentation. \n",

Following original BERT and RoBERTa implementation they are transformers with post-normalization, i.e. layer norm is happening after the attention layer. However, following Rothe et al, we can use them partially in encoder-decoder fashion by coupling the encoder and decoder parameters, as illustrated in bigbird/summarization/roberta_base.sh launch script. \n- pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(bigbp_large). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (model.ckpt-0) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (model.ckpt-300000) which works on longer documents. \n- fine-tuned tf.SavedModel for long document summarization which can be directly be used for prediction and evaluation as illustrated in the colab nootebook. \n",
