      "excerpt": "PAWS introduces a simple way to combine a very small fraction of labeled data with a comparatively larger corpus of unlabeled data during pre-training. With its approach, it sets the state-of-the-art in semi-supervised learning (as of May 2021) beating methods like SimCLRV2, Meta Pseudo Labels that too with fewer parameters and a smaller pre-training schedule. For details, I recommend checking out the original paper as well as this blog post by the authors.  \nThis repository implements and includes all the major bits proposed in PAWS in TensorFlow. The only major difference is that the pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning weren't run for the original number of epochs (600 and 30 respectively) to save compute. I have reused the utility components for PAWS loss from the original implementation. \nThe current code works with CIFAR10 and uses 4000 labeled samples (8%) during pre-training (along with the unlabeled samples). \n",

Again, note that I only pre-trained for 50 epochs (as opposed to 600) and fine-tuned for 10 epochs (as opposed to 30). With the original schedule this score should be around 96.0%.  \nIn the following PCA projection plot, we see that the embeddings of images (computed after fine-tuning) of PAWS are starting to be well separated: \n",
