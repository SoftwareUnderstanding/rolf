      "excerpt": "This is a classification model for classifying defects in mechanical parts. \nHere a pretrained model of  MobileNetV2 is used which is an open-source architechture in AI library of TensorFlow. \nBy taking the weights from that model and on top of it building one custom fully connected layer and finally the classification sigmoid layer to get the output according to the classes of our data. \nMobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks which obtains very good results on a wide array of Computer Vison tasks. Academic paper which describes MobileNets in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861. \n",
