It means that the number of final model parameters should be larger than 3.3 Million, because of the fc layer.\n\nWhen using RMSprop training strategy, the checkpoint file size should be almost 3 times as large as the model size, because of some auxiliary parameters used in RMSprop. You can use the inspect_checkpoint.py to figure it out.\n\n2.
