Read more about VGG Models in this original paper [1]. \nThe models in this repository have been built following the original paper's implementation as much as possible, though more efficient implementation could be possible due to the advancements in this field since then. On the contrary, the models contain BatchNormalization (BN) blocks after Convolutional blocks and before activation, which is deviant from the original implementation.
