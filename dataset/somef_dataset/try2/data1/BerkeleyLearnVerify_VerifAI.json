      "excerpt": "VerifAI particularly seeks to address challenges with applying formal methods to perception and ML components, including those based on neural networks, and to model and analyze system behavior in the presence of environment uncertainty. \nThe current version of the toolkit performs intelligent simulation guided by formal models and specifications, enabling a variety of use cases including temporal-logic falsification (bug-finding), model-based systematic fuzz testing, parameter synthesis, counterexample analysis, and data set augmentation. Further details may be found in our CAV 2019 paper. \nPlease see the documentation for installation instructions, tutorials, publications using VerifAI, and more. \nVerifAI was designed and implemented by Tommaso Dreossi, Daniel J. Fremont, Shromona Ghosh, Edward Kim, Hadi Ravanbakhsh, Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte, and Sanjit A. Seshia.  \n",
