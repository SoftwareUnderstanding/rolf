Thus, adversarial losses alone cannot guarantee that the learned function can map an individual input x<sub>i</sub> to a desired output y<sub>i</sub>. To further reduce the space of possible mapping functions, learned functions should be cycle-consistent. <code> L<sub>cyc</sub> (G, F) = E<sub>[x\u223cp<sub>data</sub>(x)]</sub> || F(G(x)) \u2212 x|| + E<sub>[y\u223cp<sub>data</sub>(y)]</sub> || G(F(y)) \u2212 y || </code> </p> \n<p align = \"justify\"> The full objective is: <code> L (G, F, D<sub>X</sub>, D<sub>Y</sub>) = L<sub>GAN</sub> (G, D<sub>Y</sub> , X, Y) + L<sub>GAN</sub> (F, D<sub>X</sub>, Y, X) + \u03bb L<sub>cyc</sub> (G, F) </code> , where lambda controls the relative importance of the two objectives. <i><b>\u03bb</b> is set to 10 in the final loss equation.</i> For <b>painting \u2192 photo</b>, authors found that it was helpful to introduce an additional loss to encourage the mapping to preserve color composition between the input and output. In particular, they regularized the generator to be near an identity mapping when real samples of the target domain are provided as the input to the generator i.e., <code> L<sub>identity</sub> (G, F) = E<sub>[y\u223cp<sub>data</sub>(y)]</sub> || G(y) \u2212 y || + E<sub>[x\u223cp<sub>data</sub>(x)]</sub> || F(x) \u2212 x ||. </code></p> \n<p align = \"justify\"> It is difficult to optimize adversarial objective in isolation - standard procedures often lead to the well-known problem of mode collapse. Both the mappings G and F are trained simultaneously to enforce the structural assumption.</p> \n",
