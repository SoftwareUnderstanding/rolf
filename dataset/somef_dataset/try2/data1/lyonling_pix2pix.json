      "excerpt": "In the image processing domain, the targets of many problems are always to convert one input image to its corresponding output image, like the transformation among greyscale image, gradient image and coloured image. Generally, specified algorithms will be applied for different question. For example, when using CNN to solve the problem of image translation, it's needed to define the loss function for the optimization of each problem. A common solution is to narrow down the Euclidian distance between input and output data by training CNN, while the fuzzy output would be get for the most situations.  \nThe essence of these issues is just constructing the mapping between pixels to pixels. Therefore, based on the theory of GAN(Generative Adversarial Network), pix2pix, as a common method was raised to solve these problems. \nGenerative Adversarial Network: Basically, we mentioned Generative Adversarial Network[1], GANs learn a loss that tries to classify if the output image is real or fake, while simultaneously training a generative model to minimize this loss. From which we can generate target images by feeding in some dummy input data. However, traditional GAN is not powerful enough to solve all of our image processing tasks, below we conclude two drawbacks of GAN. Lack of user control abilities. Which means user could not specify the details of outputs during training and testing, except for adjusting the training dataset. \n",
