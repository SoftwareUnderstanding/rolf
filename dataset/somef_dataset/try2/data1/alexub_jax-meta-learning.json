      "excerpt": "Simple, flexible implementations of some meta-learning algorithms in Jax. \nThe goal is that you should be able to just specify hyperparameters and \"drop in\" your choice of model, gradient-based optimizers, and distribution over tasks, and these implementations should work out-of-the-box with minimal code overhead, whether your tasks are classification, regression, reinforcement learning, or something weird and wonderful. \nThe caveats are that you need to use Flax models/optimizers (or write classes with similar API), and your \"tasks\" must be written as functions which map from a random seed and a model to a scalar loss. The MAML implementation also does not include improvements added by subsequent papers, such as trainable inner-loop learning rates. \n",
