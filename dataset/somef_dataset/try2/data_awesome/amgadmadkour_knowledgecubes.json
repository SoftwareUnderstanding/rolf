      "excerpt": "KC uses a workload-driven RDF query processing technique, or WORQ for short, for filtering non-matching entries during join evaluation as early as possible to reduce the communication and computation overhead. WORQ generates a reduced sets of triples (or reductions, for short) to represent join pattern(s) of query workloads. WORQ can materialize the reductions on disk or in memory and reuses the reductions that share the same join pattern(s) to answer queries. Furthermore, these reductions are not computed beforehand, but are rather computed in an online fashion. KC also answer complex analytical queries that involve unbound properties. Based on a realization of KC on top of Spark, extensive experimentation demonstrates an order of magnitude enhancement in terms of preprocessing, storage, and query performance compared to the state-of-the-art cloud-based solutions. \nA spark-based API for SPARQL querying \nEfficient execution of frequent workload join patterns \nMaterialze workload join patterns in memory or on disk \n",
