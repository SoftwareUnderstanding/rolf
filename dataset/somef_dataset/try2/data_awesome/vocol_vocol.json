      "excerpt": "The following steps are needed to setup the VoCol Environment either on a local machine or a web server. These steps are valid in the Linux-based operating systems and with slight modifications can be used in Windows-based as well.\n\n1. You should have the following libraries installed: Java JDK, NodeJS, NPM, and Git packages with their respective versions or higher. For more info see in **[Required libraries and tools](https://github.com/vocol/vocol/wiki/Required-libraries-and-tools)**. \n\n2. Create a new directory e.g. \"newFolder\", clone the VoCol repository, and give the execution permissions as follows:\n```\nmkdir newFolder\ncd newFolder\ngit clone https://github.com/vocol/vocol.git\nchmod u+x  .\n```\n4. Enter inside the \"VoCol\" folder and run the following script to clean up any not necessary file:\n```\ncd vocol\n./helper/scripts/resetApp.sh\n```\n5. Install the dependent packages (assuming that node package manager is installed already):\n```\nsudo npm install\n```\nSemantic-Ui framework is used in VoCol development, a couple of selections need to be given while installing it. \nSelect \"Skip install\" as follows: \n```\n? It looks like you have a semantic.json file already.\n  Yes, extend my current settings.\n> Skip install\n```\nThen \"Yes\" for that Vocol is using \"NPM Nice\".\n```\n? We detected you are using NPM Nice! Is this your project folder? D:\\vocolrepo\\vocol\n> Yes\n  No, let me specify\n```\nFinally, give \"public/semantic\" as the location of Sematic-Ui in VoCol Project.\n```\n? Where should we put Semantic UI inside your project? (semantic/) public/semantic/\n```\n6. The last step is to start VoCol with **npm start [VocolPortNumber] [SparqlEndPointPortNumber]**. In the following command, we are going to start Vocol on port 3000 where Fuseki Server is runing at port 3030\n\n```\nnpm start 3000 3030\n```\n8. You can access VoCol start page with http://localhost:3000 , if the port number was not changed. If you clear old data as step 4 describes, then the configuration page will be displayed. Otherwise, you can use http://localhost:3000/config URL for configuring of the VoCol. Sometimes, the port number is also changed during our project's development, for that, you have a possibility to look-up the vocol access's port number and as well change it, by opening **bin/www** file if you are on the root path of VoCol.\n\n9. To keep your repository synchronized with VoCol instance (for example when you push something), you should configure **a webhook path** on the repository hosting platform such as Github, GitLab and BitBucket to point with the VoCol API: **http(s)://hostname(:port or /vocolInstancePath)/listener**. The connection between both hosting server and VoCol instance should be available in such a way that hosting platform can send the notification to the VoCol instance. Please the fundamental explanations of WebHooks in the following link: [https://developer.github.com/webhooks/](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).\n\nFor more details about VoCol repository, please have a look on our [VoColWiki](https://github.com/vocol/vocol/wiki).\n    \nCheck out a list of projects that are currently using [VoCol](https://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/).\n\nMoreover, you can use the **docker image** of VoCol [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ahemid/newvocol/) or use the included Dockerfile to build the docker image.\n\n",
