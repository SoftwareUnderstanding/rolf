    "excerpt": "How to contribute\n\nGetting help\nSubmitting bug reports\nContributing code\n\nGetting help\nCommunity discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting is done on the\nCodeMirror Google group.\nSubmitting bug reports\nThe preferred way to report bugs is to use the\nGitHub issue tracker. Before\nreporting a bug, read these pointers.\nNote: The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions\nshould be asked on the\nCodeMirror Google group instead.\nReporting bugs effectively\n\n\nCodeMirror is maintained by volunteers. They don't owe you anything, so be\n  polite. Reports with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the\n  bottom of the pile.\n\n\nInclude information about the browser in which the problem occurred. Even\n  if you tested several browsers, and the problem occurred in all of them,\n  mention this fact in the bug report. Also include browser version numbers and\n  the operating system that you're on.\n\n\nMention which release of CodeMirror you're using. Preferably, try also with\n  the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been\n  fixed.\n\n\nMention very precisely what went wrong. \"X is broken\" is not a good bug\n  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the\n  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not\n  fix something that we can not observe.\n\n\nIf the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the\n  CodeMirror distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstrates\n  the problem. The best way to do this is to go to\n  jsbin.com, enter it there, press save, and\n  include the resulting link in your bug report.\n\n\nContributing code\n\nMake sure you have a GitHub Account\nFork CodeMirror\n  (how to fork a repo)\nMake your changes\nIf your changes are easy to test or likely to regress, add tests.\n  Tests for the core go into test/test.js, some modes have their own\n  test suite under mode/XXX/test.js. Feel free to add new test\n  suites to modes that don't have one yet (be sure to link the new\n  tests into test/index.html).\nFollow the general code style of the rest of the project (see\n  below). Run bin/lint to verify that the linter is happy.\nMake sure all tests pass. Visit test/index.html in your browser to\n  run them.\nSubmit a pull request\n(how to create a pull request)\n\nCoding standards\n\n2 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.\nInclude semicolons after statements.\nNote that the linter (bin/lint) which is run after each commit\n  complains about unused variables and functions. Prefix their names\n  with an underscore to muffle it.",
