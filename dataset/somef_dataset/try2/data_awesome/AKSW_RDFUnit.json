      "excerpt": "The first version  of RDFUnit (formely known as Databugger) was developed by AKSW as part of the PhD thesis of Dimitris Kontokostas. \nA lot of additional work for improvement, requirements & refactoring was performed through the [EU funded project ALIGNED](http://aligned-project.eu). Through the project, a lot of project partners provided feedback and contributed code like e.g.  Wolters Kluwers Germany and Semantic Web Company that are also users of RDFUnit.\n\nThere are also many [code contributors](https://github.com/AKSW/RDFUnit/graphs/contributors) as well as people submitted bug reports or provided constructive feedback.\n\nIn addition, RDFUnit used [Java profiler (JProfiler)](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) for optimizations\n",

Get statistics about all properties & classes in the dataset\n1. Get the namespaces out of them and try to dereference all that exist in [LOV](http://lov.okfn.org)\n1. Run our [Test Generators](https://github.com/AKSW/RDFUnit/wiki/Patterns-Generators) on the schemas and generate RDFUnit Test cases\n1. Run the RDFUnit test cases on the dataset\n1. You get a results report in html (by default) but you can request it in [RDF](http://rdfunit.aksw.org/ns/core#) or even multiple serializations with e.g.  `-o html,turtle,jsonld`\n  * The results are by default aggregated with counts, you can request different levels of result details using `-r {status|aggregate|shacl|shacllite}`. See [here](https://github.com/AKSW/RDFUnit/wiki/Results) for more details.\n\nYou can also run:\n```console\n$ bin/rdfunit -d <dataset-uri> -s <schema1,schema2,schema3,...>\n```\n\nWhere you define your own schemas and we pick up from step 3. You can also use prefixes directly (e.g. `-s foaf,skos`) we can get everything that is defined in [LOV](http://lov.okfn.org).\n\n",
