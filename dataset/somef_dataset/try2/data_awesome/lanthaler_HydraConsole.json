Thus, the\nsimplest way to install the HydraConsole is to use [Composer][4].\n\nIf you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on\nhttp://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:\n\n    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\n\nThen, use Composer's `create-project` command to download the HydraConsole\nand install all it's dependencies:\n\n    php composer.phar create-project -s dev ml/hydra-console path/to/install\n\nYou can now serve the HydraConsole with PHP's built-in web server:\n\n    php -S localhost:8000 -t path/to/install\n\nThat's it. Just fire up your browser and point it to\n\n    http://localhost:8000\n\n\n",
