      "excerpt": "You need a webserver (tested with Apache and nginx but I hope it also runs with lighttd or any other webserver) and a database backend which is supported by Erfurt (Virtuoso and MySQL).\nBecause this software is written in PHP you'll need php (>= 5.3.7) with the bindings for your webserver or fastcgi, PHP-support for your database (php-odbc or php-mysql) and php-curl.\n\n### Database Connection\nTake the prepared `config.ini-dist` file, copy it to `config.ini` and configure it according to your system setup.\nIf you have an OntoWiki runnnig you can copy the database connection section (`store.*`) into the `config.ini` of xodx.\nTo import the initial base ontology for Erfurt you have to allow virtuoso to read the xodx directory.\nYou can configure this by adding the directory to `DirsAllowed` in your `virtuoso.ini` (on debian systems you can find it at `/etc/virtuoso-opensource-6.1/virtuoso.ini`, if you are using the debian packages; or `/var/lib/virtuoso/db/virtuoso.ini`, if you are using the lod2 package or if you have build virtuoso from the source).\n\n### Erfurt, lib-dssn and Saft\nRun `make submodules` to clone Erfurt, lib-dssn-php and Saft.\n\nIf `make` failes you can try it manually with `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.\n\n### Zend\nZend is installed with `make zend` or alternatively you have to place a copy of the Zend framework library into `libraries/Zend/` you can do this by doing the following things (replace `${ZENDVERSION}` e.g. with `1.12.0`):\n\n    wget http://packages.zendframework.com/releases/ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}/ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}-minimal.tar.gz\n    tar xzf ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}-minimal.tar.gz\n    mv ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}-minimal/library/Zend libraries\n    rm -rf ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}-minimal.tar.gz ZendFramework-${ZENDVERSION}-minimal\n\n### JavaScript\nIn order to get the JavaScript dependencies [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [jquery](http://jquery.com/) run:\n\n    make resources\n\nin the xodx root directory (should be the same directory where you found this file).\n\n",
