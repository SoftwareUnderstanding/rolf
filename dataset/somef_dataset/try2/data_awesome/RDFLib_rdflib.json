      "excerpt": "RDFLib aims to be a pythonic RDF API. RDFLib's main data object is a `Graph` which is a Python collection\nof RDF *Subject, Predicate, Object* Triples:\n\nTo create graph and load it with RDF data from DBPedia then print the results:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib import Graph\ng = Graph()\ng.parse('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semantic_Web')\n\nfor s, p, o in g:\n    print(s, p, o)\n```\nThe components of the triples are URIs (resources) or Literals\n(values).\n\nURIs are grouped together by *namespace*, common namespaces are included in RDFLib:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib.namespace import DC, DCTERMS, DOAP, FOAF, SKOS, OWL, RDF, RDFS, VOID, XMLNS, XSD\n```\n\nYou can use them like this:\n\n```python\nfrom rdflib import Graph, URIRef, Literal\nfrom rdflib.namespace import RDFS\n\ng = Graph()\nsemweb = URIRef('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semantic_Web')\ntype = g.value(semweb, RDFS.label)\n```\nWhere `RDFS` is the RDFS Namespace, `g.value` returns an object of the triple-pattern given (or an arbitrary one if more exist).\n\nOr like this, adding a triple to a graph `g`:\n\n```python\ng.add((\n    URIRef(\"http://example.com/person/nick\"),\n    FOAF.givenName,\n    Literal(\"Nick\", datatype=XSD.string)\n))\n```\nThe triple (in n-triples notation) `<http://example.com/person/nick> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName> \"Nick\"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .`\nis created where the property `FOAF.giveName` is the URI `<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/givenName>` and `XSD.string` is the\nURI `<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>`.\n\nYou can bind namespaces to prefixes to shorten the URIs for RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, TriG, TriX & JSON-LD serializations:\n\n ```python\ng.bind(\"foaf\", FOAF)\ng.bind(\"xsd\", XSD)\n```\nThis will allow the n-triples triple above to be serialised like this:\n ```python\nprint(g.serialize(format=\"turtle\"))\n```\n\nWith these results:\n```turtle\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#:>\n\n<http://example.com/person/nick> foaf:givenName \"Nick\"^^xsd:string .\n```\n\nNew Namespaces can also be defined:\n\n```python\ndbpedia = Namespace('http://dbpedia.org/ontology/')\n\nabstracts = list(x for x in g.objects(semweb, dbpedia['abstract']) if x.language=='en')\n```\n\nSee also [./examples](./examples)\n\n\n",
