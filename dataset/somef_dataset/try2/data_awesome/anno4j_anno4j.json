An easy-to-use and extensible Java API allows creation and querying of Annotations even for non-experts. This API is augmented with various supporting functionalities to increase the usability of using the W3C Web Annotations. \nWith the last iteration, Anno4j has also been developed to be able to work with generic metadata models. It is now possible to parse a RDFS or OWL Lite schema and generate the respective Anno4j classes on the fly via code generation. \n",

These requirements will be tested when objects of the respective class are to be created. These Annotations are automatically generated, when a OWL Lite Schema File is parsed by the library.\r\n- **Proxy Generation Tool**: When class hierarchies get big, performance issue might arise when instance objects are to be created. The Proxy Generation Tool takes as input the set of Anno4j classes and creates a proxy set of those classes, which then can be added to the classpath of the project in order to accelerate this process.\r\n\r\nFor further information about the described new features, please refer to the [Anno4j Wiki](https://github.com/anno4j/anno4j/wiki).",
