Halyard Summary does not have yet any fancy peer UI application to present the summary, however even raw summary data might be helpful in certain situations.\r\nFrom the various improvements and bugfixes I would highlight RDF4J updated to version 2.4.1, improvements in ElasticSearch Indexer, fixes in bindings handling in [Halyard Federated Queries](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inside-halyard-5-sparql-federation-without-border-controls-sotona), better handling of namespaces during Bulk Load, fixed handling of Sesame.NIL constant according to the RDF4J standard, and several fixes in documentation.\r\n",
