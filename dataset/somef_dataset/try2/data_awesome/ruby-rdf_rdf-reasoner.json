    "excerpt": "How to contribute\nCommunity contributions are essential for keeping Ruby RDF great. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.\nDevelopment\nThis repository uses Git Flow to manage development and release activity. All submissions must be on a feature branch based on the develop branch to ease staging and integration.\n\ncreate or respond to an issue on the Github Repository\nFork and clone the repo:\n  git clone git@github.com:your-username/rdf-reasoner.git\nInstall bundle:\n  bundle install\nCreate tests in RSpec and make sure you achieve at least 90% code coverage for the feature your adding or behavior being modified.\nPush to your fork and submit a pull request.\n\nDo's and Dont's\n\nDo your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.\nDon't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.\n  Before committing, run git diff --check to make sure of this.\nDo document every method you add using YARD annotations. Read the\n  tutorial or just look at the existing code for examples.\nDon't touch the .gemspec or VERSION files. If you need to change them,\n  do so on your private branch only.\nDo feel free to add yourself to the CREDITS file and the\n  corresponding list in the the README. Alphabetical order applies.\nDon't touch the AUTHORS file. If your contributions are significant\n  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.\nDo note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule\n  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an\n  explicit public domain dedication on record from you,\n  which you will be asked to agree to on the first commit to a repo within the organization.\n  Note that the agreement applies to all repos in the Ruby RDF organization.",
