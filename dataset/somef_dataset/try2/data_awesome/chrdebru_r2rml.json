      "excerpt": "When named graphs are used in the R2RML mapping, one should use serialization that support graphs such as N-QUADS and TRIG. The use of other serializations formats (such as TURTLE) results in all triples of all graphs being written away to that file. When setting the flag filePerGraph to true for serialization formats that do not support graphs, however, the value for outputFile will be used to create a directory in which a file will be created for each graph in the RDF dataset. \n",
