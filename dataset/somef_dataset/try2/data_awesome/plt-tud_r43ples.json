All information about revisions, changes, commits, branches and tags are stored in additional named graphs beside the original graph in an attached external triple store. \nThis project provides an enhanced SPARQL endpoint for revision management of named graphs. \nR43ples uses an internal Jena TDB is attached to an existing SPARQL endpoint of a triplestore and acts as another endpoint both for normal SPARQL queries \nas well as for revision-enhanced SPARQL queries, named R43ples queries. \nThe R43ples endpoint allows to specify revisions which should be queried for each named graph used inside a SPARQL query. \nThe whole revision information is stored in additional graphs in the attached Jena TDB. \nThe website of R43ples contains further project information including Javadocs of the develop branch. \n",
