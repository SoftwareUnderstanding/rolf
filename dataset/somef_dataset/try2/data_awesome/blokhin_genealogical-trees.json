      "excerpt": "This is an example of logical reasoning applied to the graphs of genealogical trees. Defining the kinship types on top of genealogical trees seems to be the perfect use case for semantic technologies. \nThe source of data is the GEDCOM file format (.ged) common for exchange of genealogical information. With the aid of RDFLib and gedcom Python libraries GEDCOM files are converted into the OWL 2 ontologies (ABox) in Turtle syntax (.ttl file extension), adopting the TBox of the Family History Knowledge Base (FHKB, see data/header.ttl file). Note that the FHKB ontology is although very small but uses unusually complex role hierarchy and is rather hard for modern reasoners. After reasoning with the naive Python implementation of the OWL 2 RL Profile and inferring all possible triples the ontologies are finally converted to the JSON-formatted graphs for in-browser visualization. This is done inside the bundled index.html HTML5 web-app by means of D3.js JavaScript library. \nThe above is summarized in the gedcom2json.sh script, which is used like this: \n",
