However, this tool is not in any way specific to FIBO,  \nit can be used with any set of ontologies or for that matter even \"normal\" RDF files. \nIt currently uses OWLAPI and RDF4J to do the hard work, see this page for more info about those products. \n",

There are some issues with that and we're working on resolving that,  \nby either \"fixing\" the RDF/XML output generated by OWLAPI or RDF4J, or by eventually migrating to some other format.  \n",
