      "excerpt": "WIDOCO helps you to publish and create an enriched and customized documentation of your ontology, by following a series of steps in a wizard. We extend the LODE framework by Silvio Peroni to describe the classes, properties and data properties of the ontology, the OOPS! webservice by Mar\u00eda Poveda to print an evaluation and the Licensius service by Victor Rodriguez Doncel to determine the license URI and title being used. In addition, we use WebVowl to visualize the ontology and have extended Bubastis to show a complete changelog between different versions of your ontology.\n\nFeatures of WIDOCO:\n* Automatic documentation of the terms in your ontology (based on [LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/)). Now you can use Markdown on your class descriptions (see [example](doc/gallery/index.html))\n* Automatic annotation in JSON-LD snippets of the html produced.\n* Association of a provenance page which includes the history of your vocabulary (W3C PROV-O compliant).\n* Metadata extraction from the ontology plus the means to complete it on the fly when generating your ontology. Check the [best practice document](http://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/bestPractices/index-en.html) to know more about the terms recognized by WIDOCO.\n* Guidelines on the main sections that your document should have and how to complete them.\n* Integration with diagram creators ([WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/)).\n* Automatic changelog of differences between the actual and the previous version of the ontology (based on [Bubastis](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/bubastis/)).\n* Separation of the sections of your html page so you can write them independently and replace only those needed.\n* Content negotiation and serialization of your ontology according to W3C best practices\n\n",

      "excerpt": "WIDOCO separates the contents of different sections in HTML files, which are then loaded in the `index.html` file. WIDOCO was designed this way because it's easier to edit your introduction or description sections independently without being all aggregated together in a huge HTML document.  **When all the contents generated by WIDOCO are stored in a server, you will be able to see the documentation of your ontology using any browser**. However, if you open the `index.html` file **on your local browser**, you may see a document missing most of the sections in your documentation. This happens because browsers don't allow loading separate content when opening a file locally for security reasons. If you want to explore how your ontology would look locally, you have two options:\n\n* a) Execute WIDOCO with the `-uniteSections` flag; or select the option `add al sections in a single document` in the \"load sections\" step in the WIDOCO GUI. This will make all the sections of WIDOCO to be in the `index.html`; and you will be able to see it in your browser. Note that the **LODE visualization will not be available** when exploring your ontology locally.\n* b) Create a local server: Set up a local server (e.g., using XAMPP or Tomcat) and serve the files WIDOCO generates (in the `htdocs` folder for Apache servers). \n\nIf you place the files generated by WIDOCO in a server and access them via its URL (for example, a Github page), you should be able to see your documentation appropriately.\n\t\n",

A few of them are still unsopported (e.g., rdfs:seeAlso) and will be added in next releases.\r\n\r\nIn this version, I have added support for all the deprecation terms in LODE, as well as support for skos:prefLabel and  better recognition of some of the terms when the range can be a String or a resource.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Now the examples have a \"pre\" label, so if they include rdf text or json text they show properly.\r\n* A pointer to the guidelines has been added in the interface\r\n* When invoking the program using command line, the default behavior is to load the properties from the ontology. Only if a config file is provided, the properties won't be loaded. There is still a flag, which I have preferred to leave for possible legacy issues.\r\n* Markup is now recognized in all sections\r\n* The diagram is now optional (by default it was always produced in older versions)\r\n* This release also includes a doc folder with guidelines on the metadata properties to use, a benchmark of ontologies used for testing, a gallery with what WIDOCO can accomplish and a summary of projects that have adopted WIDOCO.\r\n\r\nBug fixes: \r\n* Changed the pom file with another plugin for creating the JAR, because some of the RIO parsers  were not creating the appropriate serializations of the ontology.\r\n* Added robustness when the changelog was created. If a wrong URI is provided, then the changelog will not be created.\r\n* Changed how the ontology is chosen so there won't be errors in MAC systems.\r\n* Fixed some of the language tags.\r\n* Polished some errors related to the interface.",

In order to benefit from this feature, you just have to annotate your ontology with the URI of the previous version. You can use owl:priorVersion, dc:replaces or prov:wasRevisionOf to annotate your ontology (Widoco will only consider one file to compare against).\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements:\r\n* RDF-a annotations are replaced with JSON-LD snippets. The page is just annotated with schema.org. The rdf-a annotations made it difficult to maintain, and the structured extraction tool provided by Google did not work. With the JSON-LD snippet everything is clearer. The provenance of the page itself is published separately.\r\n* Now it is possible to generate ONLY the cross reference section of an ontology.\r\n* Bug fix that led to errors when opening some ontologies like OBI\r\n\r\nOverview sample of the changelog:\r\n![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1520666/23640611/ac4407f6-02a3-11e7-8a88-b597ba740721.png)\r\n",
