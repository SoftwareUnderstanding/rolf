      "excerpt": "While the hype about the Semantic Web technologies is rising, making the developers working with Resource Description Framework (RDF) data representing a graph might be not a good solution. \nRomanticWeb is the world\u2019s first ORM class solution for graph-based data written fully in C \nRomanticWeb is also the first solution that in conjuction with it\u2019s mapping abilities allows to query for the data in a native .net way with LINQ. Developers can use their natural approach while working with data and objects and query for them with strongly typed queries, which are then translated into a SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language. \nNow it\u2019s possible to work with the full power of elastic RDF data sets with a simplicity of a classic object oriented programming! \n",
