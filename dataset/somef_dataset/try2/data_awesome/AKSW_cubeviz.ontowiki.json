Because of that, CubeViz now relies more on these technologies to handle database queries and store results.

The hierarchy is defined by one or more roots together with a property which relates concepts in the hierarchy to their child concept . The same concepts may be members of multiple hierarchies provided that different qb:parentChildProperty values are used for each hierarchy.\n  *\t**qb:hierarchyRoot**: Specifies a root of the hierarchy. A hierarchy may have multiple roots but must have at least one.\n  *\t**qb:parentChildProperty**: Specifies a property which relates a parent concept in the hierarchy to a child concept. Note that a child may have more than one parent.\n  *\t**qb:componentAttachment**: Indicates the level at which the component property should be attached, this might be an qb:DataSet, qb:Slice or qb:Observation, or a qb:MeasureProperty.\n  *\t**qb:componentRequired:** Indicates whether a component property is required (true) or optional (false) in the context of a DSD. Only applicable to components corresponding to an attribute. Defaults to false (optional).  \n  *\t**qb:order**: Indicates a priority order for the components of sets with this structure, used to guide presentations - lower order numbers come before higher numbers, un-numbered components come last.\n  *\t**qb:concept**: Gives the concept which is being measured or indicated by a ComponentProperty.\n  *\tSKOS or SDMX related entities.\n\n",
