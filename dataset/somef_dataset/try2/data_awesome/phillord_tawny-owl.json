      "excerpt": "<img src=\"docs/tawny-cartoon-only-owl.png\"\n alt=\"Tawny Logo\" title=\"Tawny OWL Logo\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\" />\n\nTawny-OWL allows construction of OWL ontologies, in a evaluative, functional\nand fully programmatic environment. Think of it as the ontology engineering\nequivalent of [R](http://www.r-project.org/). It has many advantages over\ntraditional ontology engineering tools, also described in a\n[video introduction](https://vimeo.com/89782389).\n\n- An interactive shell or REPL to explore and create ontologies.\n- Source code, with comments, editable using any of a range of IDEs.\n- Fully extensible -- new syntaxes, new data sources can be added by users\n- Patterns can be created for individual ontologies; related classes can be\n  built easily, accurately and maintainably.\n- A unit test framework with fully reasoning.\n- A clean syntax for versioning with any VCS, integrated with the IDE\n- Support for packaging, dependency resolution and publication\n- Enabled continuous integration with both ontology and software dependencies\n\nTawny-OWL is implemented as a domain-specific language but built over a full\nprogramming language called [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org). Many of the\nfeatures described (REPL, patterns, unit tests, extensibility) derive directly\nfrom the Clojure language, or from general-purpose programming tools (IDEs,\nversioning, continuous integration). The core ontology features are\nimplemented directly using the [OWL API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/).\nThese features are, therefore, industry strength, standards-compliant and\nwell-supported independently of the Tawny-OWL developers.\n\nOWL is a W3C standard ontology representation language; an ontology is a fully\ncomputable set of statements, describing the things and their relationships.\nThey are used, mostly notable in biomedicine, to describe complex areas of\nknowledge such as [genetics](http://www.geneontology.org/) or\n[clinical terminology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOMED_CT), but can\ndescribe anything, including [e-commerce](http://purl.org/goodrelations/). For\nmore tutorial information, please see http://ontogenesis.knowledgeblog.org.\n\nA [full-length manual](https://phillord.github.io/take-wing/) is also\n[available](http://github.com/phillord/take-wing). The original,\nslightly older [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) document is\navailable.\n\n",
