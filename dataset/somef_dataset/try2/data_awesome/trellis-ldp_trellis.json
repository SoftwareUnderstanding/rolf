    "excerpt": "Contributing/Development\nTrellis-LDP is always looking for people to contribute to the project. We welcome your feedback and want to listen and discuss your ideas and issues.\nThere are many different ways to help contribute to the Trellis-LDP project.\n\nHelping others by participating in the Trellis-LDP Google Group\nImproving or enhancing our documentation\nFixing open issues listed in the issue tracker\nAdding new features to the Trellis codebase\n\nGuidelines\nWhen submitting a pull request, please make sure to fork the repository and create a separate branch for your feature or fix for an issue.\nAll contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion, but before they will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple guidelines:\nCode style\nWhen submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. We realize that the style used in Trellis might be different that what is used in your projects, but in the end it makes it easier to merge changes and maintain in the future.\nTesting\nWe kindly ask that all new features and fixes for an issue should include unit tests. Even if it is small improvement, adding a unit test will help to ensure no regressions or the issue is not re-introduced. If you need help with writing a test for your feature, please don't be shy and ask!\nDocumentation\nUp-to-date documentation makes all our lives easier. If you are adding a new feature, enhancing an existing feature, or fixing an issue, please add or modify the documentation as needed and include it with your pull request.\nNew Features\nIf you would like to implement a new feature, please raise an issue before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. We appreciate the effort and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework on either side, it sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all.",
