      "excerpt": "This project presents the SDM-RDFizer, an interpreter of mapping rules that allows the transformation of (un)structured data into RDF knowledge graphs. The current version of the SDM-RDFizer assumes mapping rules are defined in the RDF Mapping Language (RML) by Dimou et al. The SDM-RDFizer implements optimized data structures and relational algebra operators that enable an efficient execution of RML triple maps even in the presence of Big data. SDM-RDFizer is able to process data from heterogeneous data sources (CSV, JSON, RDB, XML) processing each set of RML rules (TriplesMap) in a multi-thread safe procedure. \nThe SDM-RDFizer is used in the creation of the knowledge graphs of EU H2020 projects and national projects where the Scientific Data Management group participates. These projects include: \niASiS (http://project-iasis.eu/): big data for precision medicine, based on patient data insights. The iASiS RDF knowledge graph comprises more than 1.2B RDF triples collected from more than 40 heterogeneous sources using over 1300 RML triple maps.  \nBigMedilytics (https://www.bigmedilytics.eu/): lung cancer pilot. 800 RML triple maps are used to create the lung cancer knowledge graph from around 25 data sources with 500M RDF triples. \n",

By June 7th, 2020, this KG is comprised of 28M RDF triples describing at a fine-grained level 63527 COVID-19 scientific publications and COVID-19 related concepts (e.g., 5802 substances, 1.2M drug-drug interactions, and 103 molecular disfunctions).  \nThe SDM-RDFizer is also used in EU H2020, EIT-Digital and Spanish national projects where the Ontology Engineering Group (Technical University of Madrid) participates.

      "excerpt": "In version 4.0 of SDM-RDFizer, we have addressed the problem of efficiency in KG creation in terms of memory storage. SDM-RDFizer version4.0 includes a new module called \"TriplesMap Planning\" a.k.a. TMP which defines an optimized evaluation plan for the execution of triples maps. Additionally, version4.0 extends the previously included module (i.e. TriplesMap Execution a.k.a. TME) by introducing a new operator for compressing data stored in the data structures. These new features can be configured using two new parameters added to the configuration file, named \"large_file\" and \"ordered\". \n\nWe have performed extensive empirical evaluation on SDM-RDFizer version4.0 in terms of execution time and memory usage. The experiments are set up to empirically compare the impact of data duplicate rates, data size, and the complexity and the execution order of the triples maps on two versions of SDM-RDFizer (i.e. version4.0 and version3.6) and other exisiting engines icluding [RMLMapper v4.7](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java) and [RocketRML](https://github.com/semantifyit/RocketRML) ), in terms of execution time and memory usage. The experiments are performed on two different benchmarks: \n- From [SDM-Genomic-datasets](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/SDM-Genomic-Datasets/14838342/1), datasets including 10k, 100k, and 1M records with 25% and 75% duplicates rates, over six mapping rules with different complexities (1/4 simple object map, 2/5 object reference maps, 2/5 object join maps)\n- From [GTFS-Madrid](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench), datasets with scale values of 1-csv, 5-csv, 10-csv, and 50-csv, over two different mapping rules (72 simple object maps and 11 object join maps). \n\nThe results of explained experiments can be summarized as the following:\n![Overview of Results (Execution Time Comparison)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDM-TIB/SDM-RDFizer/beta/images/time.png \"Execution Time Comparison\")\nAs observed in the figures above, both versions of SDM-RDFizer completed all the testbeds successfully while the other two engines have cases of timeout. SDM-RDFizer version3.6 and RocketRML version 1.7.0 are competitve in simple testbeds, however, SDM-RDFizer version4.0 shows the best performance in all the testbeds. \n![Overview of Results (Memory Consumption Comparison)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDM-TIB/SDM-RDFizer/beta/images/memory.png \"Memory Consumption Comparison\")\nAs illustrated in the figures above, SDM-RDFizer version4.0 has the smallest peak in memory usage compared to the previous version of SDM-RDFizer.  \n\n\nThe results of the execution of SDM-RDFizer has been described in the following research reports:\n\n- Enrique Iglesias, Samaneh Jozashoori, David Chaves-Fraga, Diego Collarana, and Maria-Esther Vidal. 2020.
