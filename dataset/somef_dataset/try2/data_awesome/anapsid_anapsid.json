ANAPSID comes bundled with a helper script to generate your\nendpoints descriptions as to prevent errors.\n\n1. Create a file, e.g. endpointsURLs.txt, with the URLs of your\n   endpoints, one per line.\n\n2. Run the script. It will contact each endpoint and retrieve their\n   predicates, so it might take a while. This will save your endpoint\n   descriptions on endpointsDescriptions.txt\n\n   `$ get_predicates endpointsURLs.txt endpointsDescriptions.txt`\n\n3. You are ready to run ANAPSID.\n\n",

The recommended way to\nexecute ANAPSID is to use Python 2.7. \n\n\n1. Download ANAPSID.\n\n   You can do this by cloning this repository using Git.\n\n   `$ git clone https://github.com/anapsid/anapsid.git ~/anapsid`\n   \n   OR\n\n   You can download the latest release from Github [here](https://github.com/anapsid/anapsid/releases) \n\n2. Go to your local copy of ANAPSID and run:\n\n   `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\n   This will install ANAPSID's Python dependencies. Right now, the only library required to execute ANAPSID is ply 3.3 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ply/3.3)\n\n3. When step 2 is done you can now install ANAPSID. This will install\n   it only to your current user caged VirtualEnv as to prevent\n   polluting Python's global site-packages.\n\n   `$ python setup.py install`\n\n4.
