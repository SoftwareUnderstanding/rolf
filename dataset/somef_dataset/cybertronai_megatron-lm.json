As such, multinode training can be achieved by properly setting environment variables for the env:// init method. See the official pytorch documentation for further description of these environment variables. By default multinode training uses the nccl distributed backend. \n",

      "excerpt": "This script takes advantage of TensorFlow BERT's create_pretraining.py script to pre-cache the dataset in the TFRecord format. To convert the data to pytorch tensors we use a TFRecordDataset and tensorflow eager mode to turn the TFRecords into numpy matrices before loading them into pytorch gpu tensors. This greatly reduces the overhead of dataprocessing and speeds up training. Pass a whitespace-separated list of TFRecord paths to --train-data and enable the --use-tfrecords flag. Multinode training can be achieved as described in the previous section. \n",
