It includes code for running the few-shot supervised learning domain experiments, including sinusoid regression, Omniglot classification, MiniImagenet classification, and the newly added CIFAR-FS classification. \nFor the experiments in the RL domain, see this codebase. \nA report detailing the implementation details and reproducibility can be found here. \nFor the Omniglot, MiniImagenet and CIFAR-FS data, see the usage instructions in data/omniglot_resized/resize_images.py and data/miniImagenet/proc_images.py and data/CIFARFS/get_cifarfs.py respectively. \n",
