      "excerpt": "\r\nBefore training your own models, we recommend you to refer to the instructions described [here](https://github.com/hszhao/semseg). Then, you need to update the dataset paths in the configuration files.\r\n\r\nFour GPUs with at least 11G memory on each are required for synchronized training. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=1.0.1) and [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) are required for Sync-BN support. For apex, just follow the \"Quick Start\" part to install it.\r\n\r\nFor pretrained models, you can download them from here ([resnet50](https://hangzh.s3.amazonaws.com/encoding/models/resnet50-25c4b509.zip) and [resnet101](https://hangzh.s3.amazonaws.com/encoding/models/resnet101-2a57e44d.zip)) or my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jrm93o5ULjuOHaRQVakVF-e8MC8IAn1X). Then, create a new folder \"pretrained\" and put the pretrained models in it, like\r\n```\r\nmkdir pretrained\r\nmv downloaded_pretrained_model ./pretrained/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor training, just run\r\n```\r\nsh tool/train.py dataset_name model_name\r\n```\r\nFor instance, in our case, you can run\r\n```\r\nsh tool/train.py ade20k spnet50\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor test,\r\n```\r\nsh tool/test.py dataset_name model_name\r\n```\r\nAt present, multi-GPU test is not supported. Will implement it later.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
