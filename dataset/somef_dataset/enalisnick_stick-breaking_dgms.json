      "excerpt": "This reposiory contains Theano implementations of the models described in Deep Generative Models with Stick-Breaking Priors.  Documentation and development still in progress. \nThe Stick-Breaking Autoencoder is a nonparametric reformulation of the Variational Autoencoder.  The latent variables are drawn from a stick-breaking process, a combinatorial mechanism for sampling from an infinite distribution.  This implementation uses a truncated variational approximation; see the paper for discussion on un-truncated approaches.  The model's feedforward architecture can be seen below.  Note the cross-dependencies that are a by product of the stick-breaking process' recursive nature. \n",

This model is similar to the variational autoencoder, the change being that a class label is introduced as another latent variable that is marginalized when unobserved.  The model's feedforward architecture is diagrammed below. \n",
