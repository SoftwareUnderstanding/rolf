See issues/58. \nIn short, Precise RoI Pooling is an integration-based (bilinear interpolation) average pooling method for RoI Pooling. It avoids any quantization and has a continuous gradient on bounding box coordinates. It is: \ndifferent from the original RoI Pooling proposed in Fast R-CNN. PrRoI Pooling uses average pooling instead of max pooling for each bin and has a continuous gradient on bounding box coordinates. That is, one can take the derivatives of some loss function w.r.t the coordinates of each RoI and optimize the RoI coordinates. \ndifferent from the RoI Align proposed in Mask R-CNN. PrRoI Pooling uses a full integration-based average pooling instead of sampling a constant number of points. This makes the gradient w.r.t. the coordinates continuous. \nFor a better illustration, we illustrate RoI Pooling, RoI Align and PrRoI Pooing in the following figure. More details including the gradient computation can be found in our paper. \n",

For example, if your feature maps are down-sampled by a factor of 16 (w.r.t. the input image), you should use a spatial scale of `1/16`.\n- The coordinates for RoI follows the [L, R) convension. That is, `(0, 0, 4, 4)` denotes a box of size `4x4`.\n\n",
