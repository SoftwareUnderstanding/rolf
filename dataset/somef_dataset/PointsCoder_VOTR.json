Install the dependent libraries as follows:\n\n* Install the dependent python libraries: \n```\npip install -r requirements.txt \n```\n\n* Install the SparseConv library, we use the implementation from [`[spconv]`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). \n    * If you use PyTorch 1.1, then make sure you install the `spconv v1.0` with ([commit 8da6f96](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634)) instead of the latest one.\n    * If you use PyTorch 1.3+, then you need to install the `spconv v1.2`. As mentioned by the author of [`spconv`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv), you need to use their docker if you use PyTorch 1.4+. \n\nc. Compile CUDA operators by running the following command:\n```shell\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n",
