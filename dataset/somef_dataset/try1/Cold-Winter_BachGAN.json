The dataset can be downloaded [here](http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/ADEchallenge/ADEChallengeData2016.zip), which is from [MIT Scene Parsing BenchMark](http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/). After unzipping the datgaset, put the jpg image files `ADEChallengeData2016/images/` and png label files `ADEChallengeData2016/annotatoins/` in the same directory. \n\nThere are different modes to load images by specifying `--preprocess_mode` along with `--load_size`. `--crop_size`. There are options such as `resize_and_crop`, which resizes the images into square images of side length `load_size` and randomly crops to `crop_size`. `scale_shortside_and_crop` scales the image to have a short side of length `load_size` and crops to `crop_size` x `crop_size` square. To see all modes, please use `python train.py --help` and take a look at `data/base_dataset.py`. By default at the training phase, the images are randomly flipped horizontally. To prevent this use `--no_flip`.\n-->\n\n",
