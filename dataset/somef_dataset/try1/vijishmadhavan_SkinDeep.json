      "excerpt": "SkinDeep Video is getting ready, thanks to 3dsf (https://github.com/3dsf) for the tremendous effort he has put into this project to make this happen. \nI planned this project after watching Justin Bieber's \"Anyone\" Music Video, He had his tattoo covered up with the help of artists airbrushing on him for hours. The results were amazing in the music video. Producing that sought of video output can be difficult, so I opted for Images. Can deep learning do a decent job or can it even match photoshop? This was the starting point of this project!! \nPhotoshop can produce extremely good results but it needs expertise and hours of work retouching the whole image. \n",

Something that I got from Jason Antic's DeOldify(https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify), this made a huge difference, all of a sudden I started getting proper details around the facial features. \nProgressive Resizing (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196),(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf). Progressive resizing takes this idea of gradually increasing the image size, In this project the image size was gradually increased and learning rates were adjusted. Thanks to fast.ai for introducing me to Progressive resizing, this helps the model to generalise better as it sees many more different images. \n",
