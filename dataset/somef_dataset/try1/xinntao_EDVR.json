Clone repo\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git\n    ```\n\n1. Install dependent packages\n\n    ```bash\n    cd BasicSR\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n1. Install BasicSR\n\n    Please run the following commands in the **BasicSR root path** to install BasicSR:<br>\n    (Make sure that your GCC version: gcc >= 5) <br>\n    If you do not need the cuda extensions: <br>\n    &emsp;[*dcn* for EDVR](basicsr/models/ops)<br>\n    &emsp;[*upfirdn2d* and *fused_act* for StyleGAN2](basicsr/models/ops)<br>\n    please add `--no_cuda_ext` when installing\n\n    ```bash\n    python setup.py develop --no_cuda_ext\n    ```\n\n    If you use the EDVR and StyleGAN2 model, the above cuda extensions are necessary.\n\n    ```bash\n    python setup.py develop\n    ```\n\n    You may also want to specify the CUDA paths:\n\n      ```bash\n      CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda \\\n      CUDNN_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/cuda \\\n      CUDNN_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/cuda \\\n      python setup.py develop\n      ```\n\nNote that BasicSR is only tested in Ubuntu, and may be not suitable for Windows. You may try [Windows WSL with CUDA supports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/gpu-cuda-in-wsl) :-) (It is now only available for insider build with Fast ring).\n\n",
