      "excerpt": "A ROS wrapper for the python implementation of faster-RCNN. This wrapper is based on demo.py, that is included in the python implementation. It publishes messages containing the class, position, size and probability of the detected objects in the received images. \nFaster R-CNN is an object detection framework based on deep convolutional networks, which includes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and an Object Detection Network. Both networks are trained for sharing convolutional layers for fast testing.  \nFaster R-CNN was initially described in an arXiv tech report. \nThis ROS node is being developed as a part of this repository. The wrapper functions correctly, but some features are still missing: \n- A ROS service to send an image and receive the detections \n",
