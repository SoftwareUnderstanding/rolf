      "excerpt": "Contrary to many previous studies which proposed new interactions modules but did not deepen the importance of a robust sequence encoder, our work solely \nrely on proposing a new sequence encoder that could be easily applicable on all models that use the encoder-decoder pipeline for pedestrian trajectory forecasting while taking advantage of the research on interactions. \nWe propose an Asymmetrical Bi-RNNs architecture to replace regular LSTMs or Bi-LSTMs as a motion-encoding baseline for pedestrian trajectories forecasting: \n-- An aspect of Bi-RNNs that could be undesirable is the architecture's symmetry in both time directions. Bi-RNNs are often used in natural language processing, where the order of the words is almost exclusively determined by grammatical rules and not by temporal sequentiality. However, in trajectory prediction, the data has a preferred direction in time: the forward direction.  \n-- Another potential drawback of Bi-RNNs is that their output is simply the concatenation of two naive readings of the input in both directions. In consequence, Bi-RNNs never actually read an input by knowing what happens in the future. Conversely the idea behind our approach, is to first do a backward pass, and then use during the forward pass information about the future. By using an asymmetrical Bi-RNN to encode pedestrian trajectories, we accumulate information while knowing which part of the information will be useful in the future as it should be relevant to do so if the forward direction is the preferred direction of the data. \n",
