Dodge, Jiayu Zhou, and Fei Wang. \nMetaPred is a meta-learning framework for Clinical Risk Prediction using limited patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We given an example in the following figure: \n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/task-design.png\" alt=\" Illustration of the proposed learning procedure\" width=\"500\"></p> \nSuppose we have multiple domains, our goal is to predict Alzheimer\u2019s disease with few labeled patients, which give rise to a low-resource classification. The idea is to employ labeled patients from high-resource domains and design a learning to transfer framework with sources and a simulated target in meta-learning. There are four steps: (1) constructing episodes by sampling from the source domains and the simulated target domain; (2) learn the parameters of predictors in an episode-by-episode manner; (3) fine-tuning the model parameters on the genuine target domain; (4) predicting the target clinical risk. We respectively implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Shot Term Memory (LSTM) Network as base predictors. The model overview (meta-training procedure) is shown as follows: \n",
