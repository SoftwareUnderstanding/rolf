      "excerpt": "There are numerous other things that I have learned and failed through so far. I went into this semester with barely any knowledge of anything in this realm, and I really feel like I have learned a lot up to now, and am excited to continue to learn more and more.\n\nThe first few weeks of my semester were spent trying to learn and understand the mathematics and qualities that modern day style transfer is based off of. I read a few of the dominant papers in the field that discussed the methods.\n\nTo summarize, when creating a stylized image, there are three main players. The content photo (c), the style photo (s), and the new pistache (p).\n\nAt a high level, we want to make (p) as similar in content to (c), and as similar in style to (s). So how can we define, what \u2018content\u2019 and \u2018style\u2019 are? [4] found that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN\u2019s), when trained for object recognition, extract different types of information at different layers. If you then try to minimize the feature reconstruction for particular layers, you can extract different information. Importantly, minimizing early layers in the CNN seems to capture the texture and color images, whereas, minimizing higher layers in the CNN seem to capture image content and overall spatial structure [5].\n\nThere is a lot of math that is involved in reconstructing those layers, and minimizing the differences between images, that I won\u2019t get into here. After the initial paper was published, an important addition was made that enabled the creation of the Android application that I ended up editing. [5] demonstrated a way of not only creating stylized images, but also creating them in real time. To create the pistache in [4], there was both a forward and backward pass through a pretrained network. To fix the problem of speed, [5] trained a different neural network to quickly approximate solutions to their problem.\n\nFinally, [6] resolved an issue that allowed you to use the same network for N distinct styles instead of 1, thus saving a ton of space. This allowed the Google Codelab to contain so many distinct styles, as well as allow some of the more well known style transfer apps, like Prisma to work.\n\n\n",

      "excerpt": "A pistache is an artistic work that imitates the style of another one.\n\nThis git repo is the culumination of half a semester of work for my independent study. To date, I have edited android app, by implemented image-segmented background blurring, and increased luminance matching to a Google Codelab [1], that focuses on creating pistaches.\n\nAfter getting to this point, and remembering that this independent study was supposed to be about machine learning and art, and I hadn\u2019t made any art projects, I began to think about what I wanted to make with this unique application.\n\nI quickly realized that my moms birthday was coming up, and that I have historically never gotten her anything. For those who don\u2019t know my mom, I personally believe that she has a manic addiction to her children. That belief is entirely centered around the life she wishes to portray through her Facebook.\n\nFacebook photos tell your story, either intentionally or unintentionally, to everyone that kinda knows you.\n\nEither way, in deciding how to celebrate the birth of my mom, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to tell her story. The one she tells through Facebook that is. It isn\u2019t necessarily the story I would have chosen to portray, but it\u2019s the one she has.\n\nSo, I had the pleasure of scouring Janice\u2019s photos to build my collage, and I grew increasingly fearful for my privacy in the process. Regardless, I grabbed about 60 photos from her Facebook (and some others I wanted to throw in), and created 26 different pistaches with styles ranging from Picasso to Van Gogh, resulting in over 1500 total photos.\n\nThen, I went through the 26 pistaches for each of the 60 images, and chose the one that I thought most truly represented that memory to me. The photo that I think best captures that frozen moment. Thus, trying to portray how I view the world that she is portraying. Seeing her world through my eyes.\n\nAlso, for fun, I took all 1500 photos and put it in a super-collage, I call the meg. That photo is 170MB. That image is fucking awesome! But I had to scale down the image so I can have it on github. So the resolution is wack. But I have the real version and its literally the best thing ever.\n\n<p align=\"center\">  <img src=\"scaled_down_mega_collage.jpg?\"> </p>\n\n",

      "excerpt": "I had went for a run one morning, with the task of figuring out what I wanted to do for an independent study. The run was through my campus, and then into a wooded park near my university. About two minutes into the run, which was technically a brisk walk, my mind had already wandered from my original task, and I started to think about something cool that my professor had sent me earlier in the summer [2]. It was a 360 degree virtual reality experience of Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night world. When I watched it for the first time, I freaked out, and thought it was the coolest thing ever made. \nAnyways, that made me think about doing something like that. I really liked what that was, but it was restricted to that piece of art, that environment, and I wanted to see the whole world like that. I wanted to see the world through the lense of a famous artist, or any artist for that case. Which is what led me to read up about the style transfer, and the possibilities of experiencing the world in those ways in real time on a mobile device. \nAfter formalizing, my independent study, I did basic research as partially described below in the Process section, where I read most of the more distinguished papers on the topic. The three papers I discuss, led to the final creation of a Google Codelab [1], which in fact already implemented pretty much exactly what I wanted to do. Both a bummer, and a blessing. \nUsing the app already created by Google, allowed me to focus on different aspects of things I was interested in. I implemented the soon to be mentioned Increased Luminance Matching. Additionally, (as far as I know) I am the first to artistically use image segmentation with style transfer for the purposes of Background Blurring, where the non-focus of the images are significantly blurred to create portrait-esq photos (at least on a mobile device that is). This moved away from my initial ambition of creating an application that allowed users to become completely immersed in the environment, but I deemed it a positive step in creating something unique. \nI didn't take a direct path to where I am now. Because this isn\u2019t a part of any course, there isn\u2019t really any guide for how to learn or do anything. You kind of just have to figure it out. There were many failed attempts, and a lot of time went into finding the right things to use. When you are blindly walking through a forest, and you don\u2019t necessarily know what you are doing, it\u2019s hard to find the right path, and in many situations I threw hours and hours into dead-end after dead-end, and even though they didn\u2019t lead to any tangible results, the process of failing epically made me constantly understand more and more the problem I was trying to solve. \nThe problems that plagued my experiences revolved around getting a working model that runs inference on my computer, to one that works for Android, specifically for image segmentation. There are a number of tutorials for this, but in every situation, something was always pre-supposed. And in every situation, what I was working with didn\u2019t meet the criteria. Ultimately, I found exactly what I was looking for, but I think the process of struggling to find it has led me to have an infinitely better understand of what I am using and why I am using it. \nFor reference the model I found that ultimately worked was [3] Google Deeplab. This has modified versions of the model that are specifically made for mobile devices. For those interested, the general problem with other models are that they might use certain layers that aren\u2019t compatible with Android devices, or they might use certain features that aren\u2019t initially loaded as part of the TensorFlow library for Android. \nApplying Neural Style Transfer to images results in beautiful images that really feel like the artist themselves hand generated the image. But, in many cases images taken of the the real-world loose their real-world nature. They can become very flat and 2-Dimensional. With the help of my advisor on this project, Eunsu Kang, I aimed at bringing back the \u2018realness\u2019 of a pistache. \nI implemented two specific things to make pistaches more realistic in post-processing, Increased Luminance Matching, and Segmented Background Blurring. \nIn many situations, real world images turned into pistaches can get completely absorbed by the style they are trying to replicate. Thats the point, but sometimes you can loose what the picture is really about. And you can lose the depth that lives in a 2D image. One way to fix this is to simply weigh the style less and less, but that leaves an unsatisfying result as the original image intrudes on the new image being created. To counteract this, I have implemented luminance matching. Luminance matching is kind of already done when the image goes through the network, but I have found that increasing the intensity in post-processing can correlate with more realistic photos that still maintain the properties of the original style. Luminance matching is performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis, in which the pixel of the stylized photo is increased or decreased depending on its luminosity in proportion to the corresponding pixel luminosity of the original photo. \nAs you can see in the photos below, there are varying results. Different styles are more or less affected. But in some the change is vary apparant. I would like to add in the ability to manually adjust how much lumanince matching occurs in a photo in the app, but not right now... \n",

      "excerpt": "I found a pre-existing model for image segmentation [3]. I was able to successfully implement the model on an Android device with the help of [3.1]. My images usually focused on photos of people, so I simply masked the segmented people from a non-blurred pistache onto the blurred image of the same pistache. The resulting images have mixed results. If an image is successfully segmented then the image is usually pretty good. Some styles, though, just don't create the most fluent photos, and those don't usually end up looking too good. On the other hand, some photos look amazing. (I have only included photos I liked below, but just taking a look through all_stylized_photos, you will find some weird looking ones.) \n",
