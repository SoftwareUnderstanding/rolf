      "excerpt": "The official implementation for the Mutual Mean-Teaching: Pseudo Label Refinery for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Person Re-identification which is accepted by ICLR-2020. \nWe did the code refactoring to support distributed training and more features. Please see OpenUnReID. \nWe wrote a Chinese blog about this paper at [Zhihu]. \nWe supported DBSCAN-based MMT which could achieve better performance. Note that we effectively accelerated the Jaccard distance computing process for DBSCAN (around 200s for CPU and 60s for GPU, compared to around 10min in other repos).  \nWe added the general clustering-based baseline training for UDA re-ID, i.e. single model training with only hard pseudo labels.  \nWe slightly modified the setting of training iterations --iters from  800 to 400 in the training scripts, achieving similar performance with less time cost. \nWe discovered a minor hint, changing the setting of --dropout from 0 to 0.5 will achieve supervising improvements in MMT. Intuitively, the dual models are more de-coupled with independent dropout functions. \nA reminder here, changing the hyper-parameter --soft-tri-weight 0.8 to --soft-tri-weight 1.0 may achieve better performance in some cases. Please refer to ablation study results in Table 2 in our paper. \n",

      "excerpt": "An explanation about the number of GPUs and the size of mini-batches: \n+ We adopted 4 GPUs with a batch size of 64, since we found 16 images out of 4 identities in a mini-batch benefits the learning of BN layers, achieving optimal performance. This setting may affect IBN-ResNet-50 in a larger extent. \n+ It is fine to try other hyper-parameters, i.e. GPUs and batch sizes. I recommend to remain a mini-batch of 16 images for the BN layers, e.g. use a batch size of 32 for 2 GPUs training, etc. \n",

The model is training with a cross-entropy loss and a triplet loss, supervised by hard pseudo labels. \n+ Although the baseline in our paper adopted dual models that are independently trained with hard losses, the features extracted for clustering are averaged from dual models. It is the only difference from the general clustering-based baseline. \nHere, we supported training with the general clustering-based baseline for further academic usage. \nFor example, Duke-to-Market with ResNet-50 \n",
