You will required documentation on Docker website [ https://docs.docker.com/install/ ]\n\n2. Make sure Docker is working fine. If you are not getting any error and able to see the docker \n\n```sh\n$ docker --version\n```\n\n3. Download the docker image and create container for the tutorial\n\n```sh\n$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 0.0.0.0:6006:6006 meabhishekkumar/strata-ca-2018\n```\n\n",
