Thus, \nestablishing a Process-Structure-Property relationship is a crucial task in material design and is of interest in many engineering applications. In this work, \nthe processing-structure relationship is modelled as deep learning based conditional image synthesis problem. This approach is devoid of feature engineering, \nneeds little domain awareness, and can be applied to a wide variety of material \n",
