      "excerpt": "Manufacturing is becoming automated on a broad scale. The technology enables manufacturers to affordably boost their throughput, improve quality and become nimbler as they respond to customer demands. Automation is a revolution in manufacturing quality control. It allows the companies to set certain bars or criteria for the products being manufactured. Then it also aids in real-time tracking of the manufacturing process through machine vision cameras and/or recordings.  \nThe core deliverable for this project is building deep learning image classification models which can automate the process of inspection for casting defects. I have produced a rest endpoint which can accept a cast image and subsequently run a tuned model to classify if the cast is acceptable or not.  \n\nAs part of this project, I have built the computer vision models in 3 different ways addressing different personas, because not all companies will have a resolute data science team.  \n1.\tUsing Keras Tensorflow model (convolution2d) what a trained team of data scientists would do.\n2.\tUsing Azure Machine Learning Designer (designer) which enables AI engineers and Data scientists use a drag and drop prebuilt model DenseNet (densenet). \n3.\tUsing Azure custom vision (custom-vision) which democratizes the process of building the computer vision model with little to no training.\n\n",
