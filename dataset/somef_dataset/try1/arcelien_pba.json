PBA matches state-of-the-art results on CIFAR with one thousand times less compute, enabling researchers and practitioners to effectively learn new augmentation policies using a single workstation GPU.\n\nThis repository contains code for the work \"Population Based Augmentation: Efficient Learning of Augmentation Schedules\" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05393) in TensorFlow and Python. It includes training of models with the reported augmentation schedules and discovery of new augmentation policy schedules.\n\nSee below for a visualization of our augmentation strategy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"figs/augs_v2_crop.png\" width=\"40%\">\n</p>\n\n",

Choices are `rsvhn` or `rcifar10`.\n\nA partial GPU size is specified to launch multiple trials on the same GPU. Reduced SVHN takes around an hour on a Titan XP GPU, and Reduced CIFAR-10 takes around 5 hours.\n\n```shell\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 bash scripts/search.sh rsvhn\n```\n\nThe resulting schedules used in search can be retreived from the Ray result directory, and the log files can be converted into policy schedules with the `parse_log()` function in `pba/utils.py`. For example, policy schedule learned on Reduced CIFAR-10 over 200 epochs is split into probability and magnitude hyperparameter values (the two values for each augmentation operation are merged) and visualized below:\n\nProbability Hyperparameters over Time     |         Magnitude Hyperparameters over Time\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](figs/cifar-prob.png)  |  ![](figs/cifar-mag.png)\n\n",
