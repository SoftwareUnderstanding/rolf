      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03440 (2018).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03440)\n\n# Download:\n#### Clone the SeBRe repository by running the following command in your terminal window:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe.git\n```\n#### Additionally, download the (.zip) files by visiting the following link:\n```\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1g_894zM_mSJGfudzzfnw-ZpN-rQ4qQdz\n```\nYou would need ```DATASETSubmit.zip```, ```myDATASET.zip``` and ```SeBRe_FINAL_WEIGHTS.h5.zip``` to run the code in your machine. If you'd like to use the mouse and human brain atlas datasets used in our paper then also download and unzip ```SeBRe_Datasets.zip```. Once you've downloaded your files then unzip them in your folder by running the following commands:\n\n```\nunzip DATASETSubmit.zip\nunzip myDATASET.zip\nunzip SeBRe_FINAL_WEIGHTS.h5.zip\n```\nFollowing are the Python/library versions on which the code is tested to work fine:\n- Python (3.5.2)\n- Tensorflow (1.6.0)\n- Keras (2.1.6)\n- skimage (0.13.0)\n- Numpy (1.13.3)\n- Scipy (1.2.2)\n\n## SeBRe demo:\nThe block diagram of our system is demonstrated below:\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_block_diagram.png)\n\nRun the notebook [SeBRe_FINAL.ipynb](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_FINAL.ipynb) to reproduce the results in SeBRe's paper. Make sure to install the necessary libraries in your machine before running the code. A step-by-step explanation of feature processing in SeBRe is provided in [SeBRe_feature_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_feature_processing.ipynb) notebook.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/FP_SeBRe.png)\n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/FP_SeBRe_1.png)\n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/FP_SeBRe_2.png)\n\n## To train SeBRe on your (custom) dataset:\n\n__1__. Collect images of brain regions (or sub-regions) and place each of them in a separate folder with the following naming convention e.g. ```section_img_0.jpg, section_img_1.jpg, ...```\n\n__2__. Draw ground-truth (binary) masks on Regions of Interest (ROIs) e.g. cortex, hippocampus, etc. using a scalar vector graphics (SVG) software such as Boxy SVG [[2](https://boxy-svg.com/)], RectLabel [[3](https://rectlabel.com/)], Inkscape [[4](https://inkscape.org/)], etc. and assign a unique color code to each ROI. In the figure below, mouse brain section is shown before (a) and after (d) annotation by human expert. A zoomed-in examples of cortex (b) and hindbrain (c) are shown to precisely match the boundaries of masks with the corresponding ROIs. \n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/Supp_figure_1.png)\n\n__3__. Run the notebook [custom_dataset_create.ipynb](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/custom_dataset_create.ipynb) to generate the binary (black and white) masks to train SeBRe deep neural network (DNN). The notebook will generate the file names in SeBRe-readable format, place them in the brain region corresponding folders e.g. ```section_masks_0/section_masks_0_m_1.png, sections_masks_0_m_2.png, ...```\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_Masks.png)\n\n__4__. Modify and run the notebook [SeBRe_training.ipynb](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_training.ipynb) to train the SeBRe DNN on your (custom) dataset.\n\n__5__. Modify and run the notebook [SeBRe_FINAL.ipynb](https://github.com/itsasimiqbal/SeBRe/blob/master/SeBRe_FINAL.ipynb) to test the SeBRe DNN on your (custom) dataset.\n\n## References:\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870\n\n[2] https://boxy-svg.com/\n\n[3] https://rectlabel.com/\n\n[4] https://inkscape.org/\n\n## Cite:\nIf you use any part of this code for your work, please cite the following:\n\n```\nAsim Iqbal, Romesa Khan, and Theofanis Karayannis. \"Developing a brain atlas through deep learning.\" \nNature Machine Intelligence 1.6 (2019): 277-287.\n```"
