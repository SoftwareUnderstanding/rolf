      "excerpt": "This project is the final project of our Robotics course 2019 in Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana. We are implementing hand-based Robot-Human interaction. The general idea of this project is to make Robot ( Mighty Thymio ) can interact with environment and humans. Moreover, in this project, the interaction that we present is interaction of human hand which is detected by Mighty Thymio. While hand is detected Mighty Thymio can be able to follow the movement of it. The movement are rotating to the right or left and moving front or back while hand is detected in the middle. \n",
