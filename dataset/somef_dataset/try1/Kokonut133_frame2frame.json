      "excerpt": "MagicDraw is aimed to become an advanced paint tool for kids or artists to develop realistic images from sketches and drawings. Sketches are turned into real photographs, realizing children's imagination and cutting down on labor for designers to focus on composition instead of meticulous details. \nThis software aims at producing an end-to-end system for developing custom brushes. By simple keyword input such as \"landscape sand\", new brushes are trained and delivered. Additionally these can be harmonized with each other to reduce artifacts. \nAs this procedure requires paid services, the basic functions are free. Extended features such as customized brush creation and harmonization will be priced to cover costs. If you are part of an educational facility, contact me for free extended feature access. \n",

The license\\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\\n\\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\\n\\n    o We don\\'t promise that this software works. However, we will be\\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is\\' distribution)\\n\\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free\\' usage)\\n\\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\\n      FreeType code. (`credits\\')\\n\\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\\n\\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\\n  encourage you to use the following text:\\n\\n    Portions of this software are copyright \\xc2\\xa9 &lt;year&gt; The FreeType\\n    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\\n\\n  Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you\\n  actually use.\\n\\nLegal Terms\\n===========\\n\\n0. Definitions\\n\\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package\\', `FreeType Project\\',\\n  and  `FreeType  archive\\' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project\\', be they named as alpha,\\n  beta or final release.\\n\\n  `You\\' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\\n  `using\\' is a generic term including compiling the project\\'s source\\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program\\' or `executable\\'.\\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\\n  engine\\'.\\n\\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\\n\\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\\n  specified below.\\n\\n1. No Warranty\\n\\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS\\' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\\n  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\\n\\n2. Redistribution\\n\\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\\n  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\\n  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\\n  herein, subject to the following conditions:\\n\\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\\n      (`FTL.TXT\\') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\\n      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\\n      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\\n      files.\\n\\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\\n      documentation, though this isn\\'t mandatory.\\n\\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\\n  to us.\\n\\n3. Advertising\\n\\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\\n\\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project\\',  `FreeType Engine\\',\\n  `FreeType library\\', or `FreeType Distribution\\'.\\n\\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\\n  of this license.\\n\\n4. Contacts\\n\\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\\n\\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\\n\\n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\\n      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\\n      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\\n      haven\\'t found anything to help you in the documentation.\\n\\n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\\n\\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\\n\\n  Our home page can be found at\\n\\n    https://www.freetype.org\\n\\n--- end of FTL.TXT ---\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nfuchsia_sdk\\n\\nCopyright 2013 The Fuchsia Authors.

Some information can also be found in the JPEG\\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article.  See ARCHIVE LOCATIONS below to find\\nout where to obtain the FAQ article.\\n\\nIf you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or\\nmore of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\\nthe order listed) before diving into the code.\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n========\\n\\nThis package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,\\nand transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression\\nmethod for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG\\'s strong suit is compressing\\nphotographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and\\nbrightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or\\nother abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG\\nquality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such\\nimages.\\n\\nJPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to\\nthe input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other \"smooth\" images,\\nvery good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression\\nartifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are\\nwilling to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the \"quality\" setting in the\\ncompressor.)\\n\\nThis software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\\ncompression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\\nprocesses, although some uncommon parameter settings aren\\'t implemented yet.\\nWe have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless\\nprocesses defined in the standard.\\n\\nWe provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\\nplus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to\\nperform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\\nThe library is intended to be reused in other applications.\\n\\nIn order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\\nconsiderable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\\nfor example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\\ndecoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\\ncolormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\\nlibrary if not required for a particular application.\\n\\nWe have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between\\ndifferent JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple\\napplications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\\n\\nThe emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\\nflexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\\nthe software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\\nREFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\\nbe reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\\nachieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\\n\\nWe welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\\nNo royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\\ndocumentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\\n\\nLEGAL ISSUES\\n============\\n\\nIn plain English:\\n\\n1.

If you don\\'t have the CACM issue\\nhandy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace\\'s article is\\navailable at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually\\na preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\\nomits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\\nand some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\\nand it may not be used for commercial purposes.\\n\\nA somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\\n\"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\\nM&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\\ngood explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\\nincluding JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\\ncode but don\\'t know much about data compression in general.  The book\\'s JPEG\\nsample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\\nat a full implementation, you\\'ve got one here...\\n\\nThe best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still\\nImage Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.\\nMitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.\\nPrice US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG\\nstandards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).\\n\\nThe original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual\\nspecification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is\\ntitled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\\nPart 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\\n10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of\\nContinuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document\\nnumbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\\n\\nThe JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\\nformat.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision\\n1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report\\nand thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free\\ndownload in PDF format from\\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.\\nA PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at\\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at\\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.\\n\\nThe TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\\nftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\\nfound in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\\nIJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\\nInstead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\\n(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from\\nhttp://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision\\nof the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note\\'s design.\\nAlthough IJG\\'s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\\nuses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.\\n\\nARCHIVE LOCATIONS\\n=================\\n\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this software is www.ijg.org.\\nThe most recent released version can always be found there in\\ndirectory \"files\".\\n\\nThe JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a source of some\\ngeneral information about JPEG.\\nIt is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq\\nand other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\\narchive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\\nIf you don\\'t have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\nwith body\\n\\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1\\n\\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2\\n\\nFILE FORMAT WARS\\n================\\n\\nThe ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together\\nwith ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name\\n\"JPEG\" which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does\\nnot support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original\\nreasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on\\ncommon, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.\\nDon\\'t use an incompatible file format!\\n(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG\\nimage files indefinitely.)\\n\\nTO DO\\n=====\\n\\nPlease send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@jpegclub.org.\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nlibsdl\\nskia\\n\\nCopyright 2016 Google Inc.\\n\\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\\nmet:\\n\\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\\n\\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in\\n    the documentation and/or other materials provided with the\\n    distribution.\\n\\n  * Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its\\n    contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived\\n    from this software without specific prior written permission.\\n\\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\\n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Grants\\n\\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\\n\\n    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\\n\\n    b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\\n\\n2.2. Effective Date\\n\\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\\n\\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\\n\\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\\n\\n    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\\n\\n    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\\n\\n    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\\n\\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\\n\\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\\n\\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\\n\\n2.5. Representation\\n\\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\\n\\n2.6. Fair Use\\n\\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\\n\\n2.7. Conditions\\n\\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\\n\\n3. Responsibilities\\n\\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\\n\\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rights in the Source Code Form.\\n\\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\\n\\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\\n\\n    a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\\n\\n    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\\n\\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\\n\\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\\n\\n3.4. Notices\\n\\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\\n\\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\\n\\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\\n\\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\\n\\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\\n\\n5. Termination\\n\\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\\n\\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\\n\\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\\n\\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\\n\\n    Covered Software is provided under this License on an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\\n\\n7. Limitation of Liability\\n\\n    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\\n\\n8. Litigation\\n\\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\\n\\n9. Miscellaneous\\n\\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\\n\\n10. Versions of the License\\n\\n10.1. New Versions\\n\\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\\n\\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\\n\\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\\n\\n10.3. Modified Versions\\n\\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\\n\\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\\n\\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\\n\\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\\n\\n    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\\n\\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\\n\\n  6. Disclaimer of Warranty\\n\\n  Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\"\\n  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or\\n  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the\\n  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a\\n  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the\\n  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\\n  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You\\n  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\\n  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\\n  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is\\n  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\\n\\n  7. Limitation of Liability\\n\\n  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort\\n  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any\\n  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as\\n  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,\\n  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\\n  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\\n  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any\\n  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party\\n  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This\\n  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or\\n  personal injury resulting from such party\\'s negligence to the\\n  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\\n  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\\n  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and\\n  limitation may not apply to You.\\n\\n8. Litigation\\n\\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party\\'s ability to bring\\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\\n\\n9. Miscellaneous\\n\\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\\n\\n10. Versions of the License\\n\\n10.1. New Versions\\n\\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\\ndistinguishing version number.\\n\\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\\n\\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\\nsteward.\\n\\n10.3. Modified Versions\\n\\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\\n\\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\\nLicenses\\n\\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\\n\\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\\n\\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\\n  License, v. 2.0.
