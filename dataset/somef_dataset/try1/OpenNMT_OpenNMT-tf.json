    "excerpt": "Contributing\nThanks for being there!\nThere are many ways you can help in the OpenNMT-tf project. This document will guide you through this process.\nReporting issues\nWe use GitHub issues for bugs in the code that are reproducible. A good bug report should contain every information needed to reproduce it. Before opening a new issue, make sure to:\n\nuse the GitHub issue search for existing and fixed bugs;\ncheck if the issue has been fixed in a more recent version;\nisolate the problem to give as much context as possible.\n\nIf you have questions on how to use the project or have trouble getting started with it, consider using our forum instead and tagging your topic with the opennmt-tf tag.\nRequesting features\nDo you think a feature is missing or would be a great addition to the project? Please open a GitHub issue to describe it.\nDeveloping code\nYou want to share some code, that's great!\n\nIf you want to contribute with code but are unsure what to do,\nsearch for TODO comments in the code: these are small dev tasks that should be addressed at some point.\nlook for GitHub issues marked with the help wanted label: these are developments that we find particularly suited for community contributions.\nIf you are planning to make a large change to the existing code, consider asking first on the forum or Gitter to confirm that it is welcome.\n\nIn any cases, your new code must:\n\npass the existing tests\nbe reformatted with black and isort\npass the flake8 style checker\n\nand should:\n\nadd new tests\nincrease the code coverage\nupdate the documentation\n\nTesting\nWe recommend installing the project in editable mode with the tests dependencies:\nbash\npip install -e .[tests]\nTests are located in the opennmt/tests directory and can be executed with pytest:\nbash\npytest opennmt/tests\nHelping others\nThe project supports many model and training configurations. Sharing experiences (for example on the forum) with existing or new configurations is highly appreciated.\nAlso, people often ask for help or suggestions on the forum or on Gitter. Consider visiting them regularly and help some of them!",
