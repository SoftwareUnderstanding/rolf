Students, do not copy the material from this repository for your own projects as that constitutes plagiarism. However please feel free to browse our code and references and hopefully you will improve in building your own deep learning models. Please feel free to cite this repository if you find the material that we've discussed useful. \nDevise a model for classifying an image as bullying or not-bullying. \nTrain the model to differentiate between the 9 categories of bullying i.e gossiping, isolation, laughing, pulling hair, punching,    lapping, stabbing, strangling and quarelling. \nAlso, identify the bully and Victim in each image. \nThe model consists of 3 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers. The architecture of the model is as follows: \nConvolutional Layer 1: The input image is fed into it, the filter size is 5*5, the number of channels is 3 and a total of 10 filters are used. \nConvolutional Layer 2: The output of layer 1 is fed into it, filter size is 3*3, the number of channels is 10 and there are a total of 8 filters used. \nConvolutional Layer 3: The output of layer 2 is fed into it, filter size is 3*3, the number of channels is 8 and there are a total of 6 filters used. \nFully Connected Layer 1: The output of layer 3 is fed into it, 28286 is the number of inputs and it produces 200 outputs. \nFully Connected layer 2: The output of fully connected layer 1 is fed into it, the number of inputs is 200 and it produces 200 outputs. \n",
