We will perform transfer learning on Mobile Net model which is already trained to perform object detection. We will need to train the last 6-7 layers and freeze the remaining layers to train the model for face detection. To be able to train the Mobile Net model for face detection, we will be using WIDER FACE dataset which already has the bounding box data for various images with a single face and multiple faces. The output of the model is the bounding box data which gives the location of the face in an image. We learn to build a face detection model using Keras supported by Tensorflow. \nIn this problem, we use \"Transfer Learning\" of an Object Detector model to detect any object according to the problem in hand. \nHere, we are particularly interested in detecting faces in a given image. Below are the steps involved in the project. \n",
