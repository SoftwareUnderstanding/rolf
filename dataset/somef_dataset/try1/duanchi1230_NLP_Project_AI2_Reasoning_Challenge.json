The dataset contains 7,787 natural grade-school level multiple-choice SCIENCE questions. This dataset's level of difficulty requires far more powerful knowledge and reasoning capability than ever before datasets such SQuAD or SNLI. The data set has two partitions: EASY Set and CHALLENGE Set. And inside each set, it is also devided into train, test and development sets. A corpus is also given in the dataset which could be used as background inforamtion source. But the ARC challenge is not limited to this corpus knowledge and it could also be open book.\r\n\r\n<b> Easy: </b>  \r\nEasy-Train Set: 2251 questions  \r\nEasy-Test Set: 2376 questions  \r\nEasy-Development Set: 570 questions  \r\n\r\n<b> Challenge: </b>  \r\nThe Challenge Set contains only questions answer incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurence algorithm.  \r\n\r\nChallenge-Train Set: 1119 questions  \r\nChallenge-Test Set: 1172 questions  \r\nChallenge-Development Set: 299 questions  \r\n\r\n<b> Reference: </b>  \r\nP.

And appreciations are expressed to those who work on this project. \nWe use the AristoRoBERTaV7 as our baseline model. Currently AristoRoBERTaV7 can achieve accuracy around 0.66 on the test set.The baseline model is based on the RoBERTa-Large model and submitted by the Aristo team at Allen Institute for AI in Aug 2019. \nCurrently, the bigest change in models to tackle the ARC dataset lies in the fact that it is difficult to search the macthing paragraphs in the background knowledge due to the broad range of the questions from math, phasics, biology, chemstry,  and various science subjects. The search method in most models are based tf-idf matching the keyword in questions and answer. In our first round error analysis of the base model, we find many of the wrong answers are caused by unmatching background paragraph and ambiguous paragraph. We plan to adopt some innovative search methods which improve the search method. And we are still DEVELOPPING the method now. In regarding to the language model, we plan to adopt BERT or RoBERT. Content of our method will be updated soon... \n",
