      "excerpt": "This repository documents our Tradutturi Sicilianu, the first neural machine translator for the Sicilian language.  It documents our work and the steps to reproduce it.  We hope it opens the door to natural language processing for the Sicilian language. \nIt's the language spoken by the people of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia.  It's the language that they speak at home, with family and friends.  It's the language that the Sicilian School of Poets recited at the imperial court of Frederick II in the 13th century.  And it's a language spoken here in Brooklyn, NY. \nComparing Sicilian to Italian is like comparing American football to Australian rules football. Both football codes trace their origins to 19th-century England, but they evolved separately and have different sets of rules. Analogously, both Sicilian and Italian are Romance languages. Most of their vocabularies and grammars come from Latin, but they evolved separately and have different sets of rules. \nBut they have (of course) influenced each other.  Sicilian poetry inspired Dante, the \"father of the Italian language,\" to write poetry in his native Florentine.  And this influence on Dante reveals Sicilian's cultural importance:  Sicilian had emerged as a literary language long before Italian. \nThis repository documents the individual steps that we took to create a neural machine translator and provides the code necessary to reproduce them.  Separately, the \"With Patience and Dedication\" introduction provides a broader overview. \nHere in this repository, the extract-text directory contains the scripts that we used to collect parallel text from issues of Arba Sicula (which are in PDF format).  The dataset directory contains the scripts that we used to prepare the data for training, while its subdirectory sockeye_n30_sw3000 contains the scripts that we'll use to train the models. \n",
