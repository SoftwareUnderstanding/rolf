      "excerpt": "Since this repo is mainly concerned with exploring SSL techniques, using Transformer can be overkill. It could dominate the progress made by SSL, not to mention long training time. \nThere're many data augmentation techniques in Computer Vision, not so much in NLP. It's an open research into strong data augmentation in NLP. So far, what I found effectively is back-translation, confirmed by UDA paper. There're many ways to perform back-translation, one simple way is to use MarianMT, shipped in the excellent huggingface-transformers. \nSome data augmentation techniques I would like to explore \n",
