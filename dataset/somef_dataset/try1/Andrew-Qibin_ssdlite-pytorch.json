We use 8 GPUs with 12 GB memory to run the experiments\nwith synchronized batch normalization (important). You can also use less GPUs as long as the GPU memory is enough but make sure that the batch size is 256.\nFor example, 4 V100 GPUs are also enough for running.\n\nFor training on Pascal VOC, the batch size is set to 24 and the initial learning rate is set to 0.001. We use 4 GPUs with 12 GB memory to run the experiments\nwith the standard batch normalization.\n\nFor more implementation details, please refer to the configs in this project.\n\n",
