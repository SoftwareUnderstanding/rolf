      "excerpt": "The aim of this project is road detection from satellite images using a variant of deep Convolutional Neural Networks which is known as U-Net. The output of the model is a segmentation mask which differentiates roads from other terrains. \nU-net is an encoder-decoder type network architecture for image segmentation. The name of the architecture comes from its unique shape, where the feature maps from convolution part in downsampling step are fed to the up-convolution part in up-sampling step.  \nThis model is a slight modification of original U-Net architecture. The details of the architecture can be clearly seen in the notebook as the output of the \"model.summary()\" cell. \n",
