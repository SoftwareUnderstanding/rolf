The contracting path consists of 4x4 convolution layers with stride 2 for downsampling, each followed by batch normalization and Leaky-ReLU activation function with the slope of 0.2. The number of channels are doubled after each step. Each unit in the expansive path consists of a 4x4 transposed convolutional layer with stride 2 for upsampling, concatenation with the activation map of the mirroring layer in the contracting path, followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation function. The last layer of the network is a 1x1 convolution which is equivalent to cross-channel parametric pooling layer. We use tanh function for the last layer. \n",
