      "excerpt": "Approach Overview: Our proposed occlusion inference approach. The learned driver sensor model maps behaviors of visible drivers (cyan) to an OGM of the environment ahead of them (gray). The inferred OGMs are then fused into the ego vehicle\u2019s (green) map. Our goal is to infer the presence or absence of occluded agents (blue). Driver 1 is waiting to turn left, occluding oncoming traffic from the ego vehicle\u2019s view. Driver 1 being stopped should indicate to the ego that there may be oncoming traffic; and thus it is not safe to proceed with its right turn. Driver 2 is driving at a constant speed. This observed behavior is not enough to discern whether the vehicle is traveling in traffic or on an open road. We aim to encode such intuition into our occlusion inference algorithm. \n",

      "excerpt": "Results (Example Scenario 1): The ego vehicle (green) is waiting to turn right. Observed driver 33 is waiting for a gap in cross-traffic to make a left turn, blocking the view of the ego vehicle. Our occlusion inference algorithms produces occupancy estimates as soon as 1 second of trajectory data is accumulated for an observed driver. While driver 33 is stopped (left), our algorithm estimates occupied space in the region ahead of driver 33, encompassing occluded driver 92. When driver 33 accelerates (right), this space is inferred to be free, indicating to the ego vehicle to proceed with its right turn. These results match our intuition for these observed behaviors.   \n",
