            "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and\nbenchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on\na specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method\nstill requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language\ntask from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which\ncurrent NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,\nwe also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,\nas well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to\ntraining on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples\nof news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from\narticles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding\nand of GPT-3 in general.",

The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based\nsolely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be\nsuperior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,\nincluding ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French\ntranslation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art\nBLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction\nof the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the\nTransformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to\nEnglish constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",
