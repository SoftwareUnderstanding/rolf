            "abstract": "Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where\nthe goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image\nusing a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired\ntraining data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to\ntranslate an image from a source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the\nabsence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \\rightarrow Y$\nsuch that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the\ndistribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly\nunder-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \\rightarrow X$\nand introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \\approx X$ (and vice\nversa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired\ntraining data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object\ntransfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative\ncomparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach.",
