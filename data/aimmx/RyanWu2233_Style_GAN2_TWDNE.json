            "abstract": "The style-based GAN architecture (StyleGAN) yields state-of-the-art results\nin data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. We expose and analyze\nseveral of its characteristic artifacts, and propose changes in both model\narchitecture and training methods to address them. In particular, we redesign\nthe generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the\ngenerator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to\nimages. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer\nyields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier\nto invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a\nparticular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes\nits output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train\nlarger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model\nredefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms\nof existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.",
