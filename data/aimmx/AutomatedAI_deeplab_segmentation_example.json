Current implementation includes the following\nfeatures:\n\n1.  DeepLabv1 [1]: We use *atrous convolution* to explicitly control the\n    resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional\n    Neural Networks.\n\n2.  DeepLabv2 [2]: We use *atrous spatial pyramid pooling* (ASPP) to robustly\n    segment objects at multiple scales with filters at multiple sampling rates\n    and effective fields-of-views.\n\n3.  DeepLabv3 [3]: We augment the ASPP module with *image-level feature* [5, 6]\n    to capture longer range information. We also include *batch normalization*\n    [7] parameters to facilitate the training. In particular, we applying atrous\n    convolution to extract output features at different output strides during\n    training and evaluation, which efficiently enables training BN at output\n    stride = 16 and attains a high performance at output stride = 8 during\n    evaluation.\n\n4.  DeepLabv3+ [4]: We extend DeepLabv3 to include a simple yet effective\n    decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object\n    boundaries. Furthermore, in this encoder-decoder structure one can\n    arbitrarily control the resolution of extracted encoder features by atrous\n    convolution to trade-off precision and runtime.\n\nIf you find the code useful for your research, please consider citing our latest\nworks:\n\n*   DeepLabv3+:\n\n```\n@article{deeplabv3plus2018,\n  title={Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation},\n  author={Liang-Chieh Chen and Yukun Zhu and George Papandreou and Florian Schroff and Hartwig Adam},\n  journal={arXiv:1802.02611},\n  year={2018}\n}\n```\n\n*   MobileNetv2:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{mobilenetv22018,\n  title={Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks: Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and Segmentation},\n  author={Mark Sandler and Andrew Howard and Menglong Zhu and Andrey Zhmoginov and Liang-Chieh Chen},\n  booktitle={CVPR},\n  year={2018}\n}\n```\n\nIn the current implementation, we support adopting the following network\nbackbones:\n\n1.  MobileNetv2 [8]: A fast network structure designed for mobile devices.\n\n2.

The former networks are able to\nencode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with\nfilters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective\nfields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries\nby gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to\ncombine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model,\nDeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module\nto refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We\nfurther explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable\nconvolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules,\nresulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets,\nachieving the test set performance of 89.0\\% and 82.1\\% without any\npost-processing.

            "abstract": "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the\ndistribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters\nof the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of\nthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training\nmini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image\nclassification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14\ntimes fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant\nmargin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the\nbest published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5\nvalidation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.",

            "abstract": "We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural\nnetworks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the\ndepthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by\na pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can\nbe understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers.\nThis observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network\narchitecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced\nwith depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed\nXception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which\nInception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a\nlarger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000\nclasses. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as\nInception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but\nrather to a more efficient use of model parameters.",

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at\nmultiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade\nor in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous\nrates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous\nSpatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple\nscales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost\nperformance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our\nexperience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system\nsignificantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF\npost-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art\nmodels on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.",

            "abstract": "In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep\nLearning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to\nhave substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with\nupsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense\nprediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the\nresolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional\nNeural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of\nfilters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of\nparameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial\npyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP\nprobes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple\nsampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as\nimage context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object\nboundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.\nThe commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs\nachieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this\nby combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected\nConditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and\nquantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed \"DeepLab\"\nsystem sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image\nsegmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the\nresults on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and\nCityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.",

            "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the\nart performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and\nobject detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and\nprobabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level\nclassification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\"). We show that\nresponses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for\naccurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties\nthat make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization\nproperty of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer\nwith a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our\n\"DeepLab\" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy\nwhich is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new\nstate-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching\n71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained\nefficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole'\nalgorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net\nresponses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.",
