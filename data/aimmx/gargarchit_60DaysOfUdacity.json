            "abstract": "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an\nadversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative\nmodel G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that\nestimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than\nG. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a\nmistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space\nof arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the\ntraining data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G\nand D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained\nwith backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled\napproximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.\nExperiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and\nquantitative evaluation of the generated samples.",
