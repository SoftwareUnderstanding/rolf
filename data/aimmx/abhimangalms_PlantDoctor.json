Specifically, we retrain the MobileNets [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf), which is first trained on ImageNet dataset, on the plant disease datasets. Finally, we port the trained model to Android.\n\n### Configurations\n* [Tensorflow 1.3](https://www.tensorflow.org)\n* [Android Studio 3.0 Preview](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html)\n* Nexus 6 (Android 7.1)\n* If you have want know more about Tensorflow on Android, please find more details at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android\n\n### Dataset\nThe dataset [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03169.pdf) contains 54,306 images of plant leaves, which have a spread of 38 class labels assigned to them. Each class label is a crop-disease pair, and we make an attempt to predict the crop-disease pair given just the image of the plant leaf.\n\nThe dataset is available at https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/plantvillage-disease-classification-challenge/dataset_files.\n\n### Reference\n[1] Howard, Andrew G., et al. \"Mobilenets: Efficient convolutional neural networks for mobile vision applications.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.04861 (2017).\n\n[2] Mohanty, Sharada P., David P.

            "abstract": "Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid\nidentification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of\nthe necessary infrastructure. The combination of increasing global smartphone\npenetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep\nlearning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a\npublic dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected\nunder controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to\nidentify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained\nmodel achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images\ncollected from trusted online sources - i.e. taken under conditions different\nfrom the images used for training - the model still achieves an accuracy of\n31.4%. While this accuracy is much higher than the one based on random\nselection (2.6%), a more diverse set of training data is needed to improve the\ngeneral accuracy. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on\nincreasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path\ntowards smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",
