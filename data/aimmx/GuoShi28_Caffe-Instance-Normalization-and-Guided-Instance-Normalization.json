The details can be found in Sec. 3.2 of the paper.\n\nThe implement are: \"instance_norm_layer.cpp\", \"instance_norm_layer.cu\" and \"instance_norm_layer.hpp\". \n\nTo note that, since the implement of Batch normalization in caffe are separated into 2 layer, i.e., \"BatchNorm\" and \"Scale\".\n\nScale layer is also needed for our implement of instance_norm_layer.\n\n## Guided Instance Normalization\n\nGuided Instance Normalization can be used in style transfer.\n\nMore details can be read in Sec. 3.3 of the paper.\n\nThe \\gamma and \\beta are learned from style images instead of \"Scale\" layer.\n\nWe write 2 other layers , i.e., \"GuidedInstanceNorm\" and \"AdaScale\".\n\nGuidedInstanceNorm is used to calculate the mu and var of style images as \\gamma and \\beta.\n\nAnd AdaScale is used for Equ. 7 in the paper.\n",

            "abstract": "Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content\nimage in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer.\nHowever, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which\nlimits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural\nnetworks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately,\nthe speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed\nset of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we\npresent a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables\narbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel\nadaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance\nof the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves\nspeed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a\npre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user\ncontrols such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial\ncontrols, all using a single feed-forward neural network.",
