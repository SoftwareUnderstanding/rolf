            "abstract": "The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage\napproach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of\ncandidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied\nover a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential\nto be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors\nthus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that\nthe extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training\nof dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class\nimbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it\ndown-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal\nLoss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast\nnumber of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense\ndetector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal\nloss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors\nwhile surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage\ndetectors.
