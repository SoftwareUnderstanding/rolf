However, feel free to train the model from scratch. \\\nThe dependencies needed to run this notebook are Pytorch, Numpy, Tensorboard and Opencv. \\\n[This](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) is the Dataset.\n\n",

            "abstract": "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual\nlearning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially\ndeeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as\nlearning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of\nlearning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence\nshowing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain\naccuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate\nresidual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but\nstill having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves\n3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the\nILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100\nand 1000 layers.\n  The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual\nrecognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain\na 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual\nnets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions,\nwhere we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet\nlocalization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",
