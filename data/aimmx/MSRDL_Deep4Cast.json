Things may change :-).***\n\n``Deep4Cast`` is a scalable machine learning package implemented in ``Python`` and ``Torch``. It has a front-end API similar to ``scikit-learn``. It is designed for medium to large time series data sets and allows for modeling of forecast uncertainties.\n\nThe network architecture is based on ``WaveNet``. Regularization and approximate sampling from posterior predictive distributions of forecasts are achieved via ``Concrete Dropout``.\n\nDocumentation is available at [read the docs](https://deep4cast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Main Requirements\n- [python](http://python.org) - version 3.6\n- [pytorch](http://pytorch.org) - version 1.0\n\n### Source\nBefore installing we recommend setting up a clean [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/venv.html).\n\nFrom the package directory install the requirements and then the package.\n```\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\n## Examples\n- [Tutorial Notebooks](https://github.com/MSRDL/Deep4Cast/blob/master/docs/examples)\n\n## Authors: \n- [Toby Bischoff](http://github.com/bischtob)\n- Austin Gross\n- [Kenneth Tran](http://www.kentran.net)\n\n## References:\n- [Concrete Dropout](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07832.pdf) is used for approximate posterior Bayesian inference.\n- [Wavenet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf) is used as encoder network.\n",

            "abstract": "Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large\nvision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain\nwell-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout\nprobabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an\nimpossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved\nperformance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments\nin Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete\nmasks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for\nautomatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result\nfaster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its\nuncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed\nvariant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights into common practice\nin the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model\nlayers.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio\nwaveforms. The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the\npredictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones;\nnonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of\nthousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it\nyields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as\nsignificantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative\nsystems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the\ncharacteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch\nbetween them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model\nmusic, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical\nfragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model,\nreturning promising results for phoneme recognition.",
