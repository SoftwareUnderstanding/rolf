      "excerpt": "CEL comes with a very simple interactive interface that provides users with all essential functionalities, including interactive help system. Developing CEL is ongoing work. We aim at pushing its expressive power to the logic EL++, with which one can express, among other things, disjoint concepts, concrete domains, and nominals. \nNEWS: A beta version of CEL 1.0 has now been released! A few minor bugs have been fixed and some interesting features have been integrated. New features include role domain and range constraints, role reflxivity, ABox, more powerful subsumption queries (no longer limited to named concepts), and a weak form of incremental classification. Refer to the CEL manual for the details. \nBuild 6 of CEL 1.0 includes a prototype implementation of the algorithm for extracting the reachability-based modules (equivalent to the minimal locality-based modules modulo EL+). To modularize the ontology w.r.t. a concept or a signature, use the commands (extract-c-module C) or (extract-module S), respectively. For the details on this modularization approach and its promising experimental results on NCI, NOT-GALEN, FULL-GALEN, and SNOMED CT, take a look at this technical report. \nThe CEL manual details how to use the interactive interface. Here are a few example ontologies, med.tbox and forest.tbox, to help get an idea of what can be expressed in CEL. More toy ontologies can be found on the repository page. CEL can work as a backend reasoner for a graphical ontology editor, such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The following are the possible command line options and a couple of examples: \n",
