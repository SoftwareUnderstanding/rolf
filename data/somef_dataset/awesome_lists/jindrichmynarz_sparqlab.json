Each exercise is provided with an exemplary solution. The application is based on data on pension statistics from the Czech social security administration. The exercises focus on data exploration, such as for finding the dimensions used in the data, but also on domain-specific analyses, such as for detecting regions with the largest pay gap between male and female retirees. \n",

    "excerpt": "b'THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\\rLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\\rCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT\\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\\r\\r1. DEFINITIONS\\r\\r\"Contribution\" means:\\r\\ra) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\\rdocumentation distributed under this Agreement, and\\r\\rb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\\r\\ri) changes to the Program, and\\r\\rii) additions to the Program;\\r\\rwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\\rdistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution \\'originates\\' from\\ra Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or\\ranyone acting on such Contributor\\'s behalf. Contributions do not include\\radditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\\rdistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license\\ragreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\\r\\r\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\\r\\r\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\\rnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\\rcombined with the Program.\\r\\r\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\\rAgreement.\\r\\r\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\\rincluding all Contributors.\\r\\r2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\\r\\ra) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\\rRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\\rreproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\\rdistribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\\rsuch derivative works, in source code and object code form.\\r\\rb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\\rRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\\rLicensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\\rtransfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\\robject code form.  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the\\rContribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\\rContributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\\rcovered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\\rother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\\rlicensed hereunder.\\r\\rc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\\rto its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\\rContributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\\rintellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\\rany liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\\rinfringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\\rexercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\\rassumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\\rneeded, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\\rallow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient\\'s responsibility\\rto acquire that license before distributing the Program.\\r\\rd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\\rcopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\\rset forth in this Agreement.\\r\\r3. REQUIREMENTS\\r\\rA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\\rits own license agreement, provided that:\\r\\ra) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\\r\\rb) its license agreement:\\r\\ri) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\\rconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\\rand non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\\rand fitness for a particular purpose;\\r\\rii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\\rdamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\\rdamages, such as lost profits;\\r\\riii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\\rby that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\\r\\riv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\\rContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on\\ror through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\\r\\rWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\\r\\ra) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\\r\\rb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\\r\\rContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within\\rthe Program.\\r\\rEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\\rif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify\\rthe originator of the Contribution.\\r\\r4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\\r\\rCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\\rrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\\rintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\\rincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a\\rmanner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.\\rTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\\roffering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\\rand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\\rlosses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\\rlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the\\rIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\\rCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in\\ra commercial product offering.  The obligations in this section do not apply\\rto any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual\\rproperty infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\\ra) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\\rb) allow the Commercial Contributor tocontrol, and cooperate with the\\rCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\\rnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim\\rat its own expense.\\r\\rFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\\roffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\\rthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\\rwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\\rsuch Commercial Contributor\\'s responsibility alone. Under this section, the\\rCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\\rContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\\rcourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\\rCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\\r\\r5. NO WARRANTY\\r\\rEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON\\rAN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\\rEXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\\rCONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\\rPARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\\rappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks\\rassociated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but\\rnot limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with\\rapplicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\\runavailability or interruption of operations.\\r\\r6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\\r\\rEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\\rCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\\rSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\\rLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\\rCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\\rARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\\rEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\\rOF SUCH DAMAGES.\\r\\r7. GENERAL\\r\\rIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\\rapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\\rremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\\rparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\\rnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\\r\\rIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\\rcross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\\r(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\\rinfringes such Recipient\\'s patent(s), then such Recipient\\'s rights granted\\runder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\\r\\rAll Recipient\\'s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\\rcomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\\rdoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\\raware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient\\'s rights under this Agreement\\rterminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as\\rsoon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient\\'s obligations under this\\rAgreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall\\rcontinue and survive.\\r\\rEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\\rorder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\\rmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\\rpublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\\rtime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\\rAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\\rEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\\rSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\\rbe given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\\rContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\\rAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of\\rthe Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\\r(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\\rstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\\rlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\\rAgreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All\\rrights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are\\rreserved.\\r\\rThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\\rintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\\rAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\\rafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial\\rin any resulting litigation.\\r'",
