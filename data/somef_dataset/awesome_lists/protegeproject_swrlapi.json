A sample SWRLAPI-based project can also be found [here](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi-example).\n\nThe library's dependency information can be found here:\n\n[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/edu.stanford.swrl/swrlapi/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/edu.stanford.swrl/swrlapi)\n\nIf you'd like to be able to execute SWRL rules or SQWRL queries you will need a SWRLAPI-based rule engine implementation. Currently, a [Drools-based SWRL rule engine implementation](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi-drools-engine) is provided. This implementation is also hosted on Maven Central. Its dependency information can be found here:\n\n[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/edu.stanford.swrl/swrlapi-drools-engine/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/edu.stanford.swrl/swrlapi-drools-engine)\n\nThe SWRLAPI uses the [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi) to manage OWL ontologies.\nThe following example illustrates how the library can be used to create a SWRL query engine using an ontology \ncreated by the OWLAPI and then execute rules in that ontology.\n\n```java\n // Create OWLOntology instance using the OWLAPI\n OWLOntologyManager ontologyManager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager();\n OWLOntology ontology = ontologyManager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(new File(\"/ont/Ont1.owl\"));\n\n // Create a SWRL rule engine using the SWRLAPI\n SWRLRuleEngine swrlRuleEngine = SWRLAPIFactory.createSWRLRuleEngine(ontology);\n\n // Run the SWRL rules in the ontology\n swrlRuleEngine.infer();\n```\n\nThis example shows how the API can be used to create a SQWRL query engine, create and execute a SQWRL query using\nthis engine, and then process the results.\n\n```java\n // Create OWLOntology instance using the OWLAPI\n OWLOntologyManager ontologyManager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager();\n OWLOntology ontology = ontologyManager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(new File(\"/ont/Ont1.owl\"));\n\n // Create SQWRL query engine using the SWRLAPI\n SQWRLQueryEngine queryEngine = SWRLAPIFactory.createSQWRLQueryEngine(ontology);\n\n // Create and execute a SQWRL query using the SWRLAPI\n SQWRLResult result = queryEngine.runSQWRLQuery(\"q1\",\"swrlb:add(?x, 2, 2) -> sqwrl:select(?x)\");\n\n // Process the SQWRL result\n if (result.next()) \n   System.out.println(\"Name: \" + result.getLiteral(\"x\").getInteger());\n```\n\nExtensive documentation on the SWRLAPI can be found on the [SWRLAPI Wiki](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki).\n\n",
