Currently, pending changes are not taken into account when doing inference. \nAlso, the current version of Sesame OntoDriver is not able to include pending changes into results of SPARQL queries. \nSimilarly to JPA and JDBC driver, JOPA sits on top of an OntoDriver instance, which provides access to the underlying storage. \nThere are two main reasons for such split - first, it decouples storage-specific API usage from the more generic OOM core. \nSecond, it enables the application to switch the underlying storage with as little as 2-3 lines of configuration code.

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\\n\\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\\n\\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\\n\\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\\nversion:\\n\\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\\n\\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\\n   this License applicable to that copy.\\n\\n  3.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user\\'s computer\\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\\n       Version.\\n\\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Combined Libraries.\\n\\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\\n\\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\\n\\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\\n\\n  6.

This allows to load the lexical form of literals regardless of their type (Task #50).\r\n- Added support for RDF *simple literals*, i.e. literals of type `xsd:string`. Simple literals allow to use strings without language tags (Task #53).\r\n- Fixed handling of named graphs. Store property assertions in the subject's graph by default (Task #54).\r\n- Fixed incorrect handling of repository credentials in the RDF4J driver.\r\n- Added support for recursive entity descriptors.\r\n- Updated drivers to always use language specified by assertions and removed global language setting from the drivers.\r\n- Upgraded to OWLAPI 5.1.11, Jena 3.12.0 and RDF4J 2.5.3.\r\n\r\nNote that this version brings some changes in behavior and API. API changes are related to added support for simple literals and lexical form access. Behavioral changes concern updates to named graph treatment.
