Unlike D2RQ, it does not support SPARQL, and does not include a server application equivalent to D2RQ's D2R Server. \nr2rml-kit is currently in pre-alpha stage. It is not yet fully separated from the D2RQ codebase, and many things will not yet work. It does not support R2RML's named graph features. See TODO.md for a short-term roadmap. \n",
