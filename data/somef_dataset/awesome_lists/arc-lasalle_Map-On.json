      "excerpt": "Map-On is a web-based editor for visual ontology mapping developed at the Architecture, Representation and Computation research group of La Salle, Ramon Llull University. The Map-On editor provides a graphical environment for the ontology mapping creation using an interactive graph layout. A point-and-click interface simplifies the mapping creation process. The editor automatically generates a R2RML document based on user inputs, particularly producing IRI patterns and SQL queries. It has been used in real scenarios alleviating the effort of coding R2RML statements which is one of the main barriers for adopting R2RML in research and in the industry communities. \nThe Map-On features: \n-   Multiuser web environment for manual creation of relational-to-ontology mappings. \n-   Mapping spaces for distribution of the mapping creation process. \n-   Top-down visual representation of relational source schema, ontology structure, and mappings based on a graph layout which can be customised by users. \n-   Visual representation of an ontology using WebVOWL and a relational source based on Entity-Relationship diagrams. \n",
