    "excerpt": "CONTRIBUTING\nThe MIT Linked Data group and the rdflib.js project welcomes new contributors. This document will guide you\nthrough the process.\nStep 1: FORK\nFork the project on GitHub and check out\nyour copy.\nsh\n$ git clone git@github.com:your_username/rdflib.js.git\n$ cd rdflib.js\n$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js.git\nStep 2: BRANCH\nCreate a feature branch and start hacking:\nsh\n$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch -t origin/main\nStep 3: COMMIT\nMake sure git knows your name and email address:\nsh\n$ git config --global user.name \"J. Random User\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"j.random.user@example.com\"\nWriting good commit logs is important.  A commit log should describe what\nchanged and why.  Follow these guidelines when writing one:\n\nThe first line should be 50 characters or less and contain a short\n   description of the change prefixed with the name of the changed\n   subsystem (e.g. \"net: add localAddress and localPort to Socket\").\nKeep the second line blank.\nWrap all other lines at 72 columns.\n\nA good commit log looks like this:\n```\nsubsystem: explaining the commit in one line\nBody of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things\nin more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue\nbeing fixed, etc etc.\nThe body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and\nplease do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about\n72 characters or so. That way git log will show things\nnicely even when it is indented.\n```\nThe header line should be meaningful; it is what other people see when they\nrun git shortlog or git log --oneline.\nCheck the output of git log --oneline files_that_you_changed to find out\nwhat subsystem (or subsystems) your changes touch.\nStep 4: REBASE\nUse git rebase (not git merge) to sync your work from time to time.\nsh\n$ git fetch upstream\n$ git rebase upstream/main\nStep 5: TEST\nBug fixes and features should come with tests.  Add your tests in the\ntest/ directory.  Look at other tests to see how they should be\nstructured (license boilerplate, common includes, etc.).\nsh\n$ npm test\nMakeall tests pass.  Please, do not submit patches that fail either check.\nStep 6: PUSH\nsh\n$ git push origin my-feature-branch\nGo to https://github.com/username/rdflib.js and select your feature branch.  Click\nthe 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form.\nPull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.  If there are comments\nto address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your\nfeature branch.  Post a comment in the pull request afterwards; GitHub does\nnot send out notifications when you add commits.\nUsing HUB\nhub is a tool released by Github to help developers to use their website from command line.\nThe described guidelines can be resumed as following:\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js\n$ cd rdflib.js\nto fork the repository\n$ hub fork\nto fork the repository\n$ git checkout -b feature-branch\nafter committing your changes, push to your repo\n$ git push your_username feature-branch\nstart a PR\n$ hub pull-request\n```\nThis document is forked from joyent/node",

This should not change any behaviour; please [report a new Issue](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/issues/new) if it does. Down the road, this should lead to rdflib shipping its own type definitions. (See PR #356.)",
