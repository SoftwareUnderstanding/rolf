This feature is not ready for primetime, but if you are interested in testing this, get in touch. For more details read ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files)).\r\n- Adding back [ssh/scp](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/494)\r\n- Migrated to Java 11 as the base Java in ODK ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/492))\r\n- Adding `make_base` feature that allows to autogenerate base files from ontologies where they do not exist ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files))\r\n- Adding new command `sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-imports` which refreshes imports without refreshing mirrors. Can be used for individual ontologies as well.\r\n- Making `owltools` where necessary configurable with a bespoke memory parameter ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/487))\r\n- Fixing the GitHub action to auto-deploy the documentation ([pr](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/485)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the [DOSDP pages in ODK where generated in the wrong part](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files) of the mkdocs documentation.\r\n- New command `sh run.sh make explain_unsat` which generates a nicely formatted set of explanations for your unsatisfiable classes ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/493/files))\r\n- Adding method to [measure the memory consumption of your builds](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/495). For example, you can now run `IMAGE=odklite ODK_DEBUG=yes ./run.sh make prepare_release` to run your release on the (much lighter) `odklite` container of ODK, and get a nice benchmark summary at the end: \r\n```\r\n\r\n### DEBUG STATS ###\r\nElapsed time: 7:49.24\r\nPeak memory: 6517356 kb\r\n```\r\n- _Breaking changes_:\r\n  - Imported modules are no longer generated in OBO format automatically (only OWL). This reflects the fact that in most ontologies, even those where the editors file is in OBO format, imported ontologies are usually in OWL format. You can use the `export_obo` option to add them back  ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files))\r\n  - Equivalent class default setting changed from `all` to `asserted only` ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/497)). This means that from now on, if you dont change the setting deliberately, your pipeline will fail if their are equivalent classes that are not deliberately asserted.\r\n  - OWL 2 DL profile checking is now `true` by [default](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/481). You have to actively switch it off by setting `ensure_owl2dl_profile` to `FALSE` in your config file. \r\n\r\nTo update to the latest version of ODK:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker pull obolibrary/odkfull\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo mirgate your repository to the latest version of ODK:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd myont/src/ontology\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo #(needs to be run twice since the update process also updates the update process.)\r\n```",

        "body": "- Important: The way we install python packages has changed significantly: we are now using _fixed version dependencies_ ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/463)). If there are problems with the versions of packages we are using, please let us know immediately.\r\n- We are now using multi-stage builds in ODK for docker. The `obolibrary/odklite` container is considerably lighter (smaller) than the normal `odkfull` container you have been using so far, and it should be sufficient for most ODK pipelines.\r\n- Mirrors are now downloaded with CURL instead of ROBOT, and configurable with `mirror_retry_download` and `mirror_max_time_download` in the `import_group` section of the ODK config file ([PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/474)). *Note that the default `mirror_max_time_download` is 200 sec (a bit more than 3 minutes), which may be tight for some huge ontologies*.\r\n- odkfull now includes Souffl\u00e9.\r\n- For those who are using DOSDP patterns we re-introduced the pattern schema check even if pattern generation is skipped (it is very fast).\r\n- Created a simple way to cite ODK from within GitHub, using the CITATION.cff file. If you go to https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit, you will now see a \"cite this repo\" section under the *About* section.\r\n- Changed the default README.md to include a better reference to ODK, the correct ontology description text and the correct edit file extension.\r\n- Added a GitHub action to deploy the ODK-based mkdocs documentation ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/478)).\r\n- Created a [page](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/FrequentlyUsedODKCommands.md) for frequently used ODK commands.\r\n- Bugfixes:\r\n  - project repo name was not read correctly during `make update_repo` causing it to be named \"False\" ([commit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/commit/856a7f63c6b24b614eeae07deaf8ef1724903473))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where mirrors were not considered precious\r\n  - Fixed a bug where where the report directories where not created when running a sparql report command ([commit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/commit/dc1bb2220b978ed9adfb7cf9d2924ea6224945e3))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where `report` command incorrectly did not include components in the check ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/447))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where myont-odk.yaml was not created when using command line mode during seeding ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/384))\r\n  - Added some tests for external tools ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/472)) to ODK built process\r\n  - Konclude now works on the arm64 variant.",

Sorry; we will try again next time. You can still use the `custom` option to implement mireot yourself!\r\n  - A change in the way imports were processed introduced a very high memory footprint for large ontologies and slowed stuff down. If you do not have a lot of memory (and time!) available, you should use the following new flags: `is_large` and `use_gzipped`. `is_large: TRUE` introduces a special handling for the ontology that is faster and consumes less memory when creating an import. Using `use_gzipped` will try to download the ontology from its gzipped location. Make sure its actually there (we know its the case for chebi and pr at least)!\r\n```\r\nimport_group:\r\n  products: \r\n    - id: pr\r\n      use_gzipped: TRUE\r\n      is_large: TRUE\r\n    - id: chebi\r\n      use_gzipped: TRUE\r\n      is_large: TRUE\r\n```\r\n  - An irrelevant file (keeprelations.txt) was still generated even if needed when seeding a new repo.\r\n  - Module type `STAR` was accidentally hard coded default for slme. Now changed to `BOT` as it was.\r\n  - CI configs where not correctly copied by update routine. Now it does. Note for the changes to be picked up, you need to run `sh run.sh make update_repo` twice (once for updating the update script itself)!\r\n  - Geeky (but necessary) all phony make goals are now correctly declared as `.PHONY`.\r\n- Some last minute features:\r\n  - In new repos, the README.md is now generated with the correct, appropriate banners.\r\n  - We now have a new feature, `custom_makefile_header`, that allows injecting a custom header into the Makefile. Most mortals wont need this, but this is how it goes:\r\n```\r\ncustom_makefile_header: |\r\n  ### Workflow\r\n  #\r\n  # Tasks to edit and release OMRSE.\r\n  #\r\n  # #### Edit\r\n  #\r\n  # 1. [Prepare release](prepare_release)\r\n  # 2. [Refresh imports](all_imports)\r\n  # 3.

Direct support for MIREOT and a new module type, minimal.\r\n  - To encourage stable versions and releases, ODK, by default, merges imports into the release files. Previously, we continued to release the imports as well - which we do not recommend anymore. If you still wish to release your imports as usual, you can set a flag `release_imports` in the `import_group` section of your makefile (see [example](tests/test-release.yaml)).\r\n  - the same as the above applies for reports (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n  - The custom sparql checks, and the custom sparql exports, are now directly configurable\r\n    - `custom_sparql_checks` : Chose which additional sparql checks you want to run. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME-violation.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n    - `custom_sparql_exports` : Chose which additional sparql checks you want to run. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME-violation.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n    - `custom_sparql_exports` : Chose which custom reports to generate. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n  - `git_main_branch` : The `main` branch for your repo, default `main`, or (now discouraged, previously) `master`.\r\n  - `ci`: continuous integration defaults; currently available: `travis`, `github_actions`\r\n  - `create_obo_metadata`: This is mainly for new OBO ontologies. If true, OBO Markdown and PURL configs are created.\r\n  - `export_project_yaml`: Default `False`. If set to `True`, project.yaml is created in the top level of the repo.\r\n- Removed a few files from the standard config. This is all part of an effort to slimming down the ODK to the least number of necessary files checked into version control: `src/ontology/Dockerfile`,`src/ontology/patterns.sh`, `src/ontology/release.sh`, `src/ontology/test.sh`, and some temporary files. The `patterns` directory and all its contents only appear now when `use_dosdps`=TRUE.\r\n- Technical:\r\n  - Refactored ODK Dockerfile (merged some layers)\r\n  - added jq 1.6 which is not available via apt-get (yet).\r\n  - added sssom python package, but its in so alpha-alpha state, it should be used with caution",

OBO versions are only generated if OBO is used as the edit file serialisation.\r\n  - PAT=false now skips pattern download\r\n- Fixes to DOSDP pipeline\r\n  - DOSDP tools is updated to version 0.14. This version comes with some great changes, including:\r\n    - a mode in which multiple patterns can be compiled at once (batch mode)\r\n    - we finally have have optional columns and column values!\r\n  - external.txt can now be empty\r\n  - instead of abnormalAnatomicalEntity, an example.yaml is added to the default pattern directory\r\n- Infrastructure (only relevant to ODK developers):\r\n  - The test framework for ODK is now more dynamic: \r\n    1. Travis now correctly builds the ODK from scratch and runs the tests against the new build version\r\n    1. Instead of adding new tests to the Makefile, you can simply now drop a new YAML file into the tests/ directory.\r\n  - ODK Dockerfile has been optimised a bit for size (avoiding superfluous chmod calls)\r\n  - the yaml loader in the ODK is now replaced by a safe loader",

      "excerpt": "*Note: this is an _highly experimental_ feature as of ODK version 1.2.24. Note that the display and the scores are under active development and will change considerably in the near future.*\n\nExample implementation: \n- https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io ([web](https://obophenotype.github.io/dashboard/index.html))\nYou need two files to run the ODK dashboard generator:\n\n1. An ODK container wrapper (called `odk.sh` in the following), similar to the `run.sh` file in your typical repos `src/ontology` directory.\n2. A dashboard config YAML file (called `dashboard-config.yml` in the following)\n\nWith both files, you can then create a dashboard using the following command:\n\n```\nsh odk.sh obodash -C dashboard-config.yml\n```\n\nThe wrapper (`odk.sh`) should contain something like the following:\n\n```\n#:!/bin/sh\n#: Wrapper script for ODK docker container.\n#:\ndocker run -e ROBOT_JAVA_ARGS='-Xmx4G' -e JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx4G' \\\n  -v $PWD/dashboard:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard \\\n  -v $PWD/dashboard-config.yml:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard-config.yml \\\n  -v $PWD/ontologies:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/build/ontologies \\\n  -v $PWD/sparql:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/sparql \\\n  -w /work --rm -ti obolibrary/odkfull \"$@\"\n```\n\nNote that this essentially binds a few local directories to the running ODK container. The directories serve the following purposes:\n\n1. `dashboard`: this is where the dashboard is deposited. Look at index.html in your browser.\n2. `ontologies`: this is where ontologies are downloaded to and synced up\n3. `sparql`: an optional directory that allows you to add custom checks on top of the usual OBO profile.\n\nThis is a minimal example dashboard config for a potential phenotype dashboard:\n\n```\ntitle: OBO Phenotype Dashboard\ndescription: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies.

Default is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CAPTIALISEDONTOLOGYID).\n- `report_truncation_limit` allows truncating long (sometimes HUGE ontology reports) to make them go easier on GITHUB version control.\n- `redownload_after_hours`: this allows to specify how long to wait before trying to download an ontology (which could be a time consuming process!) again.\n- `environment`: is currently a necessary parameter but will be made optional in future versions. It allows adding environment variables directly to the config, rather than passing them in as -e parameters to the docker container (both are equivalent though.)\n- `profile` is an optional parameter that allows specifying your own profile for the quality control (ROBOT) report. By default, this is using the ROBOT report default profile. You can either specify your own profile from scratch, or extend the current default with additional test by using the `baseprofile` parameter. Find out more about ROBOT profiles [here](http://robot.obolibrary.org/report#profiles).\n\nA fully working example can be found [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io).\n",
