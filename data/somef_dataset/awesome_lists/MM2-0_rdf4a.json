    "excerpt": "How to contribute\nSo you want to help out making RDF4J better. That's great! Here's some things you need\nto know and do before you dive in.\nTable of Contents  \n\nLegal stuff\nDeveloper Workflow: Which Branch?\nA note on the 1.0.x release branch and Java 7 compatibility\nCode formatting\nCreating your contribution\nSubmitting your changes\n\nLegal stuff\nRDF4J is a project governed by the Eclipse Foundation, which has strict policies and guidelines regarding contributions.\nIn order for any contributions to RDF4J to be accepted, you MUST do the following things:\n\n\nDigitally sign the Eclipse Foundation Contributor License Agreement.\nTo sign the Eclipse CLA you need to:\n\n\nObtain an Eclipse Foundation userid. If you already use Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit you already have one of those. If you don\u2019t, you need to\nregister.\n\n\nLogin into the projects portal, select \u201cMy Account\u201d, and then the \u201cContributor License Agreement\u201d tab. Read through, then sign.\n\n\nAdd your github username in your Eclipse Foundation account settings. Log in it to Eclipse and go to account settings.\n\n\n\"Sign-off\" your commits\n\n\nEvery commit you make in your patch or pull request MUST be \"signed off\".\nYou do this by adding the -s flag when you make the commit(s).\nDeveloper Workflow: Which Branch?\nRDF4J feature development takes place against the master branch. In addition,\neach minor release has its own release branch (e.g. releases/1.0.x, and\nreleases/2.0.x), on which hotfixes/patches are done.\nEvery issue, no matter how small, gets its own branch. New features and enhancements are usually\ndeveloped on branches from the master branch. Patches or hotfixes for bugs in existing\nreleases are developed on a branch split off from the releveant release branch.\nIssue branch names are always prefixed with issues/, followed by the issue\nnumber in the GitHub issue tracker,\nfollowed by one or two dash-separated keywords for the issue. \nFor example (fictional): issues/#6-sparql-npe is the branch for a fix for\nGitHub issue #6, which has to do with SPARQL and a NullPointerException.\nIf you're unsure on which branch a contribution should be made, please ask!\nA note on the 1.0.x release branch and Java 7 compatibility\nRDF4J 1.0 is a backport of RDF4J 2.0, to be executable on a Java 7 Runtime Environment. This means that we do not accept any fixes or feature development directly against the releases/1.0.x branch, and we never merge this branch back into either master, or the releases/2.0.x branch. \nInstead, new features are developed against the master branch, and these are never merged into either release branch (they are instead scheduled for inclusion in the next minor or major release: 2.1, or 3.0). Bug fixes and minor improvements (which are sufficiently minor that they can be considered part of a patch release) are developed against the releases/2.0.x branch, which can then be merged back into releases/1.0.x branch. \nSince releases/1.0.x is to be kept compatible with Java 7, it is inevitable that it will occassionally become unstable when merging the releases/2.0.x branch into it: the build process verifies that the branch is Java 7-compatible, so it will fail with a compilation error when this happens. These compilation failures can be fixed by branching a hotfix branch directly directly off the releases/1.0.x branch.\nCode formatting\nRDF4J uses custom code formatting settings and a few code templates as well, and we expect every contributor to apply these settings before submitting a contribution.\nThe simplest way to do apply code formatting is as follows:\n\nIn Eclipse, open 'Preferences' -> 'Java' -> 'Code Style' -> 'Formatter' \nClick 'Import...' and find the file eclipse-settings/rdf4j-formatting.xml, located in the git repository root.\nThe active profile should now say 'RDF4J formatting'. Click ok.\nWhen making changes to Java code, hit Ctrl+Shift+F before saving to reformat the code. Alternatively, you can configure Eclipse to automatically apply formatting on save. This can be activated by going to 'Preferences' -> 'Java' -> 'Editor' -> 'Save Actions' and making sure the 'Format source code' option checkbox is ticked.\n\nSimilarly, to apply templates:\n\nIn Eclipse, open 'Preferences' -> 'Java' -> 'Code Style' -> 'Code Templates' \nClick 'Import...' and find the file eclipse-settings/codetemplates.xml, located in the git repository root.\nClick OK. The templates will be automatically applied when necessary. \n\nCreating your contribution\nOnce the legalities are out of the way and you're up-to-date on our workflow and code formatting, you can \nstart coding. Here's how:\n\nCreate an issue in the RDF4J GitHub issue tracker that describes your improvement, new feature, or bug fix. Alternatively, comment on an existing issue to indicate you're keen to help solve it.\nFork the repository on GitHub\nCreate a new branch for your changes (see the Developer Guidelines above for details - please make sure you pick the correct and up-to-date starting branch!)\nMake your changes\nMake sure you include tests\nMake sure the test suite passes after your changes\nCommit your changes into the branch. Please use descriptive and meaningful commit messages. Reference the issue number in the commit message (for example \" #6 added null check\")\nSign off every commit you do, as explained above.\nOptionally squash your commits (not necessary, but if you want to clean your commit history a bit, this is the point to do it).\nPush your changes to your branch in your forked repository\n\nSubmitting your changes\nOnce you are satisfied your changes are in good shape, you can use GitHub to\nsubmit a pull request (PR) for your contribution back to the central RDF4J\nrepository. Again, please make sure you submit your PR against the correct branch (the appropriate release branch if you fixed a bug, or the master branch if you developed a new feature). \nOnce you have submitted your PR, do not use your branch for any other\ndevelopment (unless asked to do so by the reviewers of your PR). If you do, any\nfurther changes that you make will be visible in the PR.",
