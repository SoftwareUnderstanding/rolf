      "excerpt": "Imperium is a plugin for the Play! framework similar to the existing JPA plugin that allows the use of Empire seamlessly in a Play! based application. \nIt provides two base module classes, RdfModel which is designed as a jumping off point for using both standard Hibernate based JPA and Empire in the same application with the same model.  When you persist your existing Hibernate backed beans to the database, they will also be persisted to your RDF store.  Also provided is EmpireModel which is an RDF-only base class for creating Play! model beans. \n",
