    "excerpt": "How to contribute\nFirst of all thank you for contributing to SEPA, we really needs brave volunteers as you.\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc4d\nIf you haven't already, come find us on gitter (#sepa_dev/Lobby# on freenode). We want you working on things you're excited about.\nHere are some important resources:\n\nResearch Group tells you who we are and what we are doing\nHere you can read a more detailed description of Sparql Event Processing archietecture if you want to contribute to the platform you are invated to read it,\nProtocol specification is our vision on how to deliver SPARQL query events\nBugs? Github Issues is where to report them\nIf you want contact us feel free to send an email to @lroffia and @relu91\n\nTesting\nWe have developed a set of unit tests for basic functionalities of the engine. Before submit your contribution verify that they are \nsuccesful in your development enviroment. Use the following command:\nbash\nmaven test\nMoreover the complex interactions with the underlaying SPARQL endpoint are tested with a set of integration tests. To run them first\nyou need to have a running blazegraph instance in your localmachine and then use this following command inside the main folder of the project repository:\nbash\nmaven verify\nSubmitting changes\nPlease send a GitHub Pull Request to arces-wot/SEPA following the template and with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). \nWhen you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you also add tests that check your changes. \nWe can always use more test coverage. \nPlease make sure all commits are atomic (one feature per commit).\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:\n$ git commit -m \"A brief summary of the commit\n&gt; \n&gt; A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.\"\n\nFuthermore, use the following commit convention:\n * Start the commit with Add if you added a feature\n * Start with Modify if you changed some behaviour of previous features\n * Start with Fix if your commit contain a fix of a bug\n * Follow the good practise guide for commit\nWe use as the base branch the dev, branch from there and add your changes. PR against master branch will be rejected, master branch is only used for releases.\nThanks,\nLuca and Cristiano \ud83d\ude4c",

      "excerpt": "SEPA (**S**PARQL **E**vent **P**rocessing **A**rchitecture) is a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability. The architecture is built on top of generic SPARQL endpoints (conformant with [SPARQL 1.1 protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)) where publishers and subscribers use standard **SPARQL 1.1** [Updates](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) and [Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/). Notifications about events (i.e., changes in the **RDF** knowledge base) are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification. To know more about SEPA architecture and vision please refer to this [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/10/4/36/htm).

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\\n\\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\\n\\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\\n\\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\\nversion:\\n\\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\\n\\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\\n   this License applicable to that copy.\\n\\n  3.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user\\'s computer\\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\\n       Version.\\n\\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
