Evaluation consisted of loading Brick models of different sizes into the respective reasoning engine and timing how long it took to produce the materialization. reasonable is about 7x faster than Allegro and 38x faster than OWLRL on this workload. \nTo facilitate usage, we use the pyo3 project to generate Python 3.x bindings to this project. \n",
