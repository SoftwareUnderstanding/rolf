If they are, it's better to install from that source so that they will be kept up to date for you.\n\nYou will also need an account on AWS and have the ability to create [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) accounts and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets.\n\n",

      "excerpt": "It is sometimes useful to run a single test (instead of the whole test suite). The Surefire Maven plugin allows for this, but it's worth noting that when a single test is run in this way the test suite's pre-configured system properties are not picked up from the plugin's configuration. To work around this, a dev who wants to run a single test must supply the necessary properties theirself. For example, if one wanted to run the functional test that checks that missing images get a placeholder image in the manifest, the command to do that would be:\n\n    mvn integration-test -Dtest=MissingImageFT -Dfester.s3.bucket=iiif-fester -Dfester.placeholder.url=\"https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/iiif/2/blank\" -Dfester.logs.output=true\n\nYou would want to supply your own values for `fester.s3.bucket` and `fester.placeholder` of course. This command will spin up the Docker container that the functional test is run against, but it will only run the `MissingImageFT` test, skipping all the integration and other functional tests in the suite.\n\n",
