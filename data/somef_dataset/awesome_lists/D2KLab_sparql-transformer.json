The JSON-LD can be:\n- an already parsed JS object (or defined real time),\n- **ONLY if running in NodeJS**, the local path of a JSON file (that will then be read and parsed).\n\nThe `options` parameter is optional, and can define the following:\n\n| OPTION | DEFAULT | NOTE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|context | http://schema.org/ | The value in `@context`. It overwrites the one in the query.|\n| sparqlFunction | `null` | A function receiving in input the transformed query in SPARQL, returning a Promise. If not specified, the module performs the query on its own<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup> against the specified endpoint.  |\n| endpoint | http://dbpedia.org/sparql | Used only if `sparqlFunction` is not specified. |\n| debug | `false` | Enter in debug mode. This allow to print in console the generated SPARQL query. |\n\n\nSee [`test.js`](./test.js) for further examples.\n\n\n",
