To add the ORCID property, select the add new property path button ![here](demo_images/add_new_property_path_icon.PNG) Then fill out the settings as shown ![here](demo_images/adding_orcid_property.PNG) to give it a name and datatype. Press submit to add it to the form. Click the save button at the bottom of the screen to see a screen like ![this](demo_images/save_shacl_screen.PNG) From here you can download the shape and add additional annotation such as an `rdfs:label` and correct naming. The SHACL can then be uploaded to the SHACL store as shown ![here](demo_images/uploading_shacl.PNG)\r\n\r\n",
