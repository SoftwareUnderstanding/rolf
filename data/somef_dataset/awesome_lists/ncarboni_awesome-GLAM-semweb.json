These owners may\\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\\nefforts of others.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\\nto, the following:\\n\\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\\n  and translate a Work;\\n\\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\\n\\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\\'s image or likeness\\n  depicted in a Work;\\n\\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\\n\\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\\n  a Work;\\n\\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\\n\\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\\n\\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\\'s Copyright\\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\\ndetriment of Affirmer\\'s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer\\'s express Statement of Purpose.\\n\\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\\nAffirmer\\'s express Statement of Purpose.
