    "excerpt": "Contributing to a project of the RDF-Ext organization\nWe'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make RDF-Ext even better than it is today!\nHere are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:\nDiscussions\nThe discussions project is the right place to talk about general RDF-Ext topics.\nIf you are not sure to which project your topic belongs, just open an issue in that project.\nStyleguide\nAll projects managed in the RDF-Ext organisation use the standard code style.\nStandard is also configured as lint script in every package.json file.\nSo you can use npm run lint beside standard to check the style.\nPull Requests\nAll developers, also members of the organization, must use forks and pull requests to submit contributions.\nBranches\nGitflow is used to manage branches and versions.\nThe workflow is described here and here\nTests\nAll contributions should be covered by a mocha test.",
