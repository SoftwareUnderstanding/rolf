On complex queries, the performance is improved by over 40%. \nRewriting of the HTTP service component, ghttp, with improved robustness and the addition of functions such as user permission, heartbeat detection, batch import, and batch deletion; API documents are added. \nImplementation of the Personalized PageRank (PPR) extension function, which can be invoked in the SELECT clause to calculate the correlation between entities. \nSupport for arithmetic operations (e.g., ?x + ?y = 5) in the FILTER clause. \nSupport for transactional operations, such as begin, tquery (transactional query), commit, and rollback; \nA new executive component, gserver, is added to provide another pathway for remote access of gStore aside from the ghttp component, which implements two-way communication via the socket API. \nUnification of the format of command line arguments of executive components. The --help option is uniformly introduced (e.g., $ bin/gbuild --help or $ bin/gbuild -h), by which users can view the command manual including the meaning of each option. \n",
