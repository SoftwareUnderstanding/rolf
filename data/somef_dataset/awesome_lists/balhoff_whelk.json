      "excerpt": "Whelk is based on ELK, and ELK is much faster at classifying an ontology. Some reasons to use Whelk include:\n- object property assertion materialization\n- SWRL rules (class and object property atoms)\n- OWL RL features for Abox\n- some classification for unions in superclass position (e.g., infer least common subsumer of operands)\n  - Example: \n    ```\n    C SubClassOf B\n    D SubClassOf B\n    E EquivalentTo C or D\n    then\n    E SubClassOf B\n    ```\n  - *this feature is useful, but not guaranteed to be complete*\n- extended support for Self restrictions, supporting rolification\n- in application code, submitting many DL queries programmatically (Whelk is much faster at this)\n- in application code, performing many DL queries in parallel, non-blocking\n- in application code, storing a reasoning state (e.g., Tbox classification) and simultaneously extending it with multiple independent new axiom sets (e.g., Aboxes); or, quickly rolling back to a previous, saved reasoning state\n\n",
