      "excerpt": "Akutan has the following system dependencies:\n - It's written in [Go](https://golang.org/). You'll need v1.11.5 or newer.\n - Akutan uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)\n   extensively to encode messages for [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), the log of data\n   changes, and storage on disk. You'll need protobuf version 3. We reccomend\n   3.5.2 or later. Note that 3.0.x is the default in many Linux distributions, but\n   doesn't work with the Akutan build.\n - Akutan's Disk Views store their facts in [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/).\n\nOn Mac OS X, these can all be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n\t$ brew install golang protobuf rocksdb zstd\n\nOn Ubuntu, refer to the files within the [docker/](docker/) directory for\npackage names to use with `apt-get`.\n\nAfter cloning the Akutan repository, pull down several Go libraries and additional\nGo tools:\n\n\t$ make get\n\nFinally, build the project:\n\n\t$ make build\n\n",

      "excerpt": "The fastest way to run Akutan locally is to launch the in-memory log store:\n\n\t$ bin/plank\n\nThen open another terminal and run:\n\n\t$ make run\n\nThis will bring up several Akutan servers locally. It starts an API server that\nlistens on localhost for gRPC requests on port 9987 and for HTTP requests on\nport 9988, such as <http://localhost:9988/stats.txt>.\n\nThe easiest way to interact with the API server is using `bin/akutan-client`. See\n[docs/query.md](docs/query.md) for examples. The API server exposes the\n`FactStore` gRPC service defined in\n[proto/api/akutan_api.proto](proto/api/akutan_api.proto).\n\n",
