( If installing on a public server make sure the proxy\nurl is set. )\n \nFor subdomains on your local machine you will need to edit `/etc/hosts` for each server. For\nmachines on the web you can just assign all domains to the same ip address.\n\n```bash\n[RWWeb] $ run -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=noCA -Drww.subdomains=true -Dhttp.hostname=localhost -Drww.subdomains=true -Dsmtp.password=secret\n```\n\nYou can the create yourself a subdomain by pointing your browser to the root domain:\n[https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/). This will lead you to the account creation \npage, which will allow you to create subdomains on your server. An e-mail will be sent to \nyour e-mail address for verification ( but you will be able to find the link in the logs \nif the e-mail server is not set up). \n\n\n",
