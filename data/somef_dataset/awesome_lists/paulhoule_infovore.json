In the case of :BaseKB Now production,  all of the steps are submitted as a unit to Amazon EMR so that a single cluster does all the work,  rather than starting new clusters.  This helps with speed, reliability, cost and all that.\n\nNot using EMR?  No problem.  Haruhi will submit the jobs sequentially to your cluster.\n\nThis release has some minor bug fixes and also marks increasing process maturity because the maven-release plugin is integrated #44 and we are know using Travis CI to monitor build quality #45.\n",
