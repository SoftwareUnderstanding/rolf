      "excerpt": "This is an RDF Data Cube Validator. Its significant difference from other existing validators is that it is not based on SPARQL queries, as its name \"NoSPA\". Jena library is used to manipulate RDF models. The official SPARQL queries for constraint checks are interpreted and parsed by this validator to search functions with nested statement listing functions provided by Jena and filters for different conditions. It has an outstanding performance because the entire process is executed in memory. I believe that it is valuable to sacrifice some memory for saving time.\n\nHere are some references and knowledge background for this tool:\n  * The official RDF data cube spec: [The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/)\n  * Jena API: [Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org/index.html)\n  * The official SPARQL spec: [SPARQL 1.1 Query Language](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)\n\n",
