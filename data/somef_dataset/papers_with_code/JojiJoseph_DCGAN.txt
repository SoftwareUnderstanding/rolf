# GAN

Implementation of DCGAN and Conditional DCGAN, in tensorflow.

This work is based on,

GAN - [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).

CGAN - [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)

DCGAN - [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
