You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.
