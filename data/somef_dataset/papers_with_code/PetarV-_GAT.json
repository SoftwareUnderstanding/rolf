It ships with an inductive (PPI) example as well.\n\nGAT is a popular method for graph representation learning, with optimised implementations within virtually all standard GRL libraries:\n- \\[PyTorch\\] [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- \\[PyTorch/TensorFlow\\] [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/)\n- \\[TensorFlow\\] [Spektral](https://graphneural.network/)\n- \\[JAX\\] [jraph](https://github.com/deepmind/jraph)\n\nWe recommend using either one of those (depending on your favoured framework), as their implementations have been more readily battle-tested.\n\nEarly on post-release, two unofficial ports of the GAT model to various frameworks quickly surfaced. To honour the effort of their developers as early adopters of the GAT layer, we leave pointers to them here.\n- \\[Keras\\] [keras-gat](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/keras-gat), developed by [Daniele Grattarola](https://github.com/danielegrattarola);\n- \\[PyTorch\\] [pyGAT](https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT), developed by [Diego Antognini](https://github.com/Diego999).\n\n",
