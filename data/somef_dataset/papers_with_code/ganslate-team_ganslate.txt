# `ganslate` - a simple and extensible GAN image-to-image translation framework

For comprehensive documentation, visit: https://ganslate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

***Note**: The documentation is still in progress! Suggestions and contributions are welcome!* 

`ganslate` is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework which aims to make GAN image-to-image translation more accessible to both beginner and advanced project with:

- Simple configuration system
- Extensibility for other datasets or architectures
- Documentation and [video walk-throughs (soon)](INSERT_YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST)

## Features

- 2D and 3D support
- Mixed precision
- Distributed training
- Tensorboard and [Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) logging
- Natural and medical image support
- A range of generator and discriminator architectures
