# CNN-with-Spacial-Pyramid-Pooling-Implementation
This repository is a work in progress. I am currently trying to implement spacial pyramid pooling in my network between the convolutional layers and the fulley connected layers in an attempt to negate preprocessing any images  that I want to train the network on. Currently the next work is being trained to detect dogs. Ideally I want to make a network which can detect various races and ethnicities of people.
