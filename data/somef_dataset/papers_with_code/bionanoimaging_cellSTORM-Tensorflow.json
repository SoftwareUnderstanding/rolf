Thanks to the Tensorflow team for making such a quality library!  And special thanks to Phillip Isola for answering my questions about the pix2pix code.\n\nKudos to [Christopher Hesse](https://github.com/christopherhesse) for his amazing pix2pix TensorFlow implementation and [Gene Kogan](http://genekogan.com/) for his inspirational workshop. Many thanks to Ingo Fuchs for the help with the Android APP.\n\n\n",
