      "excerpt": "The original implementation comes up with a fixed number of 1000 classification due to using ImageNet dataset for training and evaluation purposes. The developed ResNet model is flexible enough to accept any number of classed according to the user's requirements.   \nMentionable that ResNet18 and ResNet34 uses a lighter residual block that other three deeper models as shown in the Figure below where the deeper residual block with a bottleneck structure is for ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152. \nThe architecture of ResNeXt, also known as ResNet_v3, is almost same as that of the original ResNet, except the Residual Block as shown in the figure below. The aggregated residual block in ResNeXt divides the input tensor into multiple parallel paths based on the cardinality factor set by the user. Normally the more paths we have, the better is the performance and the lighter is the network. This image from the paper shows three equivalent structure for Aggregated Residual Blocks. In this code, only model (b) has been implemented (so far).   \n",

The user has the option for:  \n1. Choosing any of 5 available ResNet or ResNeXt models for either 1D or 2D tasks. \n2. Varying number of input kernel/filter, commonly known as the Width of the model. \n3. Varying number of classes for Classification tasks and number of extracted features for Regression tasks. \n",
