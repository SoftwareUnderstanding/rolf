# Using Machine Learning to quantify the strength of weathering at carbonate rock landscapes

![Extent of karstified areas over Europe](./images/map_of_europe_karst.png)

## Format of the bordering tiles dataset:

    - A subset of tiles that include bordering zones of karst areas areas was created
    - Data was stored in a compressed .npz file containing 14664 images, 
		11731 images for training and 2933 images for testing.
    - The Data was stored in 4 seperate arrays containing testing and training input and output 
		(x_train/x_test for input and y_train/y_test for output)
    - Input data contains a 3D array with elevation, slope and surface roughness
    - output data contains a 3D binary array with replicated channels
