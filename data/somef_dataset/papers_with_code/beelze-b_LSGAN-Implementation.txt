Implementation Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04076

Some of the code is inspired from the GAN/LSGAN Implementations in https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN


Overall, LSGANs tend to do better than GANs on Fashion-MNIST when looking at Frechet Inception Distance.

Included are py files of the notebooks, so some of the tests doing non-batch norm tests have been overwritten. 
This project is mostly to document a project for a Graduate Computer Vision class.
