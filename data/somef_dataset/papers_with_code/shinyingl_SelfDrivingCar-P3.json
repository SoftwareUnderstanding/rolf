Before Lenet model, most pattern reconfition systems used a combination of automatic learning techneqiques and hand-crafted algorithms. LeNet learns the internal representation from raw images automatically. [1] LeNet is simple and provides good accuracy for this project. ReLU is used to prevent saturation and faster convergence in gradient decent.   \nAdam opimizer is used because it provides good computational efficiency. [2] \nA large Epocs is chosen to first overfit the model, then the final Epcs step is chosen to be 51 because it provides good model accuracy and hte loss is saturated.  \nThe Epocs and Learning rate are chosen by observing where accuracy and loss start to saturate in the below figures. \n- Learning Rate = 0.0009 is used becuse it provides a good convergence curve with a reasonable Epocs of 51. \nThe final model results are: \n",

      "excerpt": "They are chosen in order to check if the model can clasify traffic signs with different shape, color, and text/ symbol representations. \nBelow is some more elabrations on how the addiional images are chosen: \n01.jpg (Priority raod): it is a less common color compared to most of the signs. There is also a relative strong line features in the background. It is used to check if the background will increase any interference.  \n02.png (Yield): It is a base line image as I expect this should be easier to identified as the backgournd is clean and sign feature is simple.  \n03.png (Ahead only): In my early model with less prediction accuracy, the classifier is mixing it with the \"turn right ahead\". I use this image as the output for \"Visualizing the Neural Network\" section. I noticed that because of the low resoution of the image, the old model will somehow recongize some noisy sigal on the right side of arrow head. That makes the image to be recongized as turn right ahead. The issues is gone after the precition accuracy is improved. \n04.png (Beware of ice/snow): There is a complicated symbol on the sign while the image resolution is low. It turnes out the model failed on this most of the time. I did quite a few runs with the same model, sometimes the model can get it right. I think how the model recongize the features is somewhat related to the training sequence since the only difference in each run I notice is the training image sequence.  \n05.jpg (Stop): The background is noisy. \nHere are the results of the prediction: \n",
