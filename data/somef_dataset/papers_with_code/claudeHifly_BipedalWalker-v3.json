They were implemented some of the latest approaches of RL for robotic locomotion, initially they were considered simple algorithms and then move on to more complex and advanced algorithms. \nThe main goal of this project is that to solve the problem characterized by the environment  BipedalWalker-v3. The problem arises as concluded when the robot chooses correct actions for \ndon't fall and walk to the end of the path. \nIn particular, the reward returned by the environment is a value of the continuous space which depends on the distance the robot travels. Formally the resolution of the problem occurs when the robot gets an average reward greater than 300 (path completed) for 100 consecutive episodes: \n",
