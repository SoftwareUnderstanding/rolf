# Everybody-Can-Dance-Now-Video-game-version-
Implemented human to game character transfer based on the UCB paper with the same name. Used pose estimation api by CMU and trained a Conditional GAN model on the pose estimated stick pose stick figure to learn a video game character. Further refinement in the project can be of great use to get animated version of real-life movies. 

HUMAN TO HUMAN TRANSFER

Training:


 Initial Training
To see how is GAN learning the images:














Transfer Human to Human:
We transfer from a freestyle technique from a freestyle dancer on a Zumba dancer
