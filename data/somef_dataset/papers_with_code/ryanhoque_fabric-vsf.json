      "excerpt": "To visualize the simulator in real time, you will need to install the OpenGL renderer,\nwhich is currently an independent C++ program. However this won't be possible if running\nVisual MPC on a remote server. In this case, there are other ways to inspect results\n(see `vismpc/README.md`).\n\nThese instructions have been tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 18.04. For some\nreason, we have not been able to get this working for Ubuntu 16.04. For Ubuntu 18.04, you\nmight need sudo access for `make -j4 install`.\n\n1. Navigate to `render/ext/libzmq`. Run\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4 install\n```\n2. Navigate to `render/ext/cppzmq`. Again run\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4 install\n```\n3. Navigate to `render`. Run\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\n```\n\nFinally you should have an executable `clothsim` in `render/build`. **To test\nthat it is working, go to `render/build` and run `./clothsim` on the command\nline. You should see an empty window appear. There should be no segmentation\nfaults.** Occasionally I have seen it fail on installed machines, but normally\nrebooting fixes it.\n\nTo activate the renderer, set `init: render_opengl` to `True` in your cfg file.\n\nNotes:\n\n- If you make changes to `width`, `height`, or `render_port` in\n  `cfg/env_config.yaml`, please also update `num_width_points`,\n  `num_height_points`, and `render_port` respectively in\n  `render/scene/pinned2.json`.\n\n- It's easier to change the viewing angle by directly adjusting values in\n  `clothSimulator.cpp`, rather than with the mouse and GUI. When you adjust the\n  camera angles, be sure to re-compile the renderer using the instructions\n  above. You only need to re-compile `render`, not the other two.\n\n[1]:https://github.com/openai/gym/tree/master/gym/envs\n[2]:https://github.com/openai/gym/pull/1314\n[3]:https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09044\n[4]:https://sites.google.com/view/fabric-vsf\n[5]:https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dvrk-vismpc/tree/master\n",

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n\n3. Run `python setup.py install`. This should automatically \"cythonize\" the\nPython `.pyx` files and allow you to run `from gym_cloth import ...` regarless\nof current directory.
