      "excerpt": "BERT, published by Google, is new way to obtain pre-trained language model word representation. Many NLP tasks are benefit from BERT to get the SOTA. \nThe goal of this project is to obtain the token embedding from BERT's pre-trained model. In this way, instead of building and do fine-tuning for an end-to-end NLP model, you can build your model by just utilizing or token embedding. \nThis project is implemented with @MXNet. Special thanks to @gluon-nlp team. \n",
