Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs. \nColab is able to provide free resources in part by having dynamic usage limits that sometimes fluctuate, and by not providing guaranteed or unlimited resources. This means that overall usage limits as well as idle timeout periods, maximum VM lifetime, GPU types available, and other factors vary over time. Colab does not publish these limits, in part because they can (and sometimes do) vary quickly. \nThe types of GPUs that are available in Colab vary over time. This is necessary for Colab to be able to provide access to these resources for free. The GPUs available in Colab often include Nvidia K80s, T4s, P4s and P100s. \n",

      "excerpt": "Brain tumor is one of the most fearsome medical problems globally today. With the advent of various natural factors, this is among one of those medical problems that is seeing a significant rise in happenstance. Our project aims to utilize the analytical power of neural networking in engineering a method for accurate detection of tumorous tissue in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Based on a type of network known as Deep Neural Network (DNN), our solution proposes, on a limited scale, to identify low and high grade glioblastomas (a type of tumor) pictured in a cerebral MRI scan. These tumors can appear anywhere in the brain, and have variable shapes and contrasts in an MRI, which translates to the requirement of a machine learning solution for detection of these phenomena that exploits a flexible and high capacity DNN, while at the same time, being extremely efficient. Our aim is to produce a rough-edged, efficient, but effective assistive tool that learns as it is used for radiologists\u2019 use in machine-assisted detection of tumors, in order that the physician has a time-effective and accurate tool in their disposal in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of this life-threatening malady. \n",
