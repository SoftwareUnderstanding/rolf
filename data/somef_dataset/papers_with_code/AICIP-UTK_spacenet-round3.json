Moving towards more accurate fully automated extraction of road networks will help bring innovation to computer vision methodologies applied to high-resolution satellite imagery, and ultimately help create better maps where they are needed most. \nThe goal is to extract navigable road networks that represent roads from satellite images. The linestrings the algorithm returns is compared to ground truth data, and the quality of the solution is judged by the Average Path Length Similarity (APLS) metric. \n",

At an intersection, other paths would be saved to explore later. For our test example, we were able to perfectly replicate the image, using 16 linestrings but 7000 points. We further improved this solution to reduce the number of points to 3500 by tracking our current direction, and only adding a point when the direction changed. \nHere is the mask generated when we draw the linestrings extracted from the skeletonized 10 pixel image. \n",
