It is highly effective in segmentation. This U-Net model is developed for segmentation of Brain Tumor in MRI scans using Keras and MedPy using the BraTS dataset \nMedPy package is installed in Python2 using scripts in (code-python2) and is used to load the data. The data is preprocessed and stored in a n256256*5 numpy array.  \n",
