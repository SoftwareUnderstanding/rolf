We include an implementation of DDPG (DDPG.py), which is not used in the paper, for easy comparison of hyper-parameters with TD3. This is not the implementation of \"Our DDPG\" as used in the paper (see OurDDPG.py). \n\nAlgorithms which TD3 compares against (PPO, TRPO, ACKTR, DDPG) can be found at [OpenAI baselines repository](https://github.com/openai/baselines). \n\n",
