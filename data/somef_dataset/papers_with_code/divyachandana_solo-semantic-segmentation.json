We will much appreciate your contribution.\nCode style\nPython\nWe adopt PEP8 as the preferred code style.\nWe use the following tools for linting and formatting:\n- flake8: linter\n- yapf: formatter\n- isort: sort imports\nStyle configurations of yapf and isort can be found in .style.yapf and .isort.cfg.\nWe use pre-commit hook that checks and formats for flake8, yapf, isort, trailing whitespaces,\n fixes end-of-files, sorts requirments.txt automatically on every commit.\nThe config for a pre-commit hook is stored in .pre-commit-config.\nAfter you clone the repository, you will need to install initialize pre-commit hook.\npip install -U pre-commit\nFrom the repository folder\npre-commit install\nAfter this on every commit check code linters and formatter will be enforced.\n\nBefore you create a PR, make sure that your code lints and is formatted by yapf.\n\nC++ and CUDA\nWe follow the Google C++ Style Guide.",
