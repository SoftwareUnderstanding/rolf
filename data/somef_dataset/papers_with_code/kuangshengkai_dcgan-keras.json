The model implementation mainly refers to the paper of https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434 with several keypoints distinguishing to several other open-source implementations of DCGAN seen on github: \n* Replace pooling layers with strided Conv2DTranspose (generator) and Conv2D (discriminator), allowing the network to learn its own spatial downsampling according to the paper; \n",
