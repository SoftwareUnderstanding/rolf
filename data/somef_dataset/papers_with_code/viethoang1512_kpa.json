      "excerpt": "Currently, a pretrained KPA encoder with [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) backbone is available, which can be automatically downloaded from Google Drive when initializing the `KeyPointAnalysis` instance. We used the 4 last hidden state representations of the [CLS] token as the whole sentence embedding and trained it with *TupletMarginLoss* and *IntraPairVarianceLoss* on the ArgKP dataset. For the code, see [main.py](scripts/main.py).\n\n```python\n#: Import needed libraries\nfrom qs_kpa import KeyPointAnalysis\n\n#: Create a KeyPointAnalysis model\n#: Set from_pretrained=True in order to download the pretrained model\nencoder = KeyPointAnalysis(from_pretrained=True) \n\n#: Model configuration\nprint(encoder)\n\n#: Preparing data (a tuple of (topic, statement, stance) or a list of tuples)\ninputs = [\n    (\n        \"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence\",\n        \"a cure or treatment may be discovered shortly after having ended someone's life unnecessarily.\",\n        1,\n    ),\n    (\n        \"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence\",\n        \"Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better\",\n        1,\n    ),\n    (\"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence\", \"Assisted suicide is akin to killing someone\", 1),\n]\n\n#: Go and embedd everything\noutput = encoder.encode(inputs, convert_to_numpy=True)\n```\n\nIn a [comparison](scripts/compare.py) with the baseline model-which directly uses sentence embedding from RoBERTa model, in a subset of ArgKP dataset (for avoiding target leakage), our model strongly outperforms and exhibits rich representation learning capacity. Evaluation metrics (relaxed and strict mean Average Precision) are retained from the [KPA_2021_shared_task](IBM/KPA_2021_shared_task).\n\n```abc\nModel using roBERTa directly: mAP strict = 0.4633403767342183 ; mAP relaxed = 0.5991767005443296\nOur pretrained model: mAP strict = 0.9170783671441644 ; mAP relaxed = 0.9722347939653511\n```\n\n",
