From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.\n\n```json\nExample:\n{\n  \"text\": [\n    \"I would like to punch you.\",\n    \"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\"\n  ]\n}\n\nResult:\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"original_text\": \"I would like to punch you.\",\n      \"predictions\": {\n        \"toxic\": 0.9796434044837952,\n        \"severe_toxic\": 0.07256634533405304,\n        \"obscene\": 0.058431386947631836,\n        \"threat\": 0.8635178804397583,\n        \"insult\": 0.11121545732021332,\n        \"identity_hate\": 0.013826466165482998\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"original_text\": \"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\",\n      \"predictions\": {\n        \"toxic\": 0.00029103411361575127,\n        \"severe_toxic\": 0.00012417171092238277,\n        \"obscene\": 0.0001522742968518287,\n        \"threat\": 8.440738747594878e-05,\n        \"insult\": 0.00016013211279641837,\n        \"identity_hate\": 0.00012860879360232502\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nUse the ```model/predict``` endpoint to submit input text in json format. The JSON structure should have one key, ```text```, with as value a list of input strings to be analyzed. An example can be found in the image below.\n\nSubmitting proper json data triggers the model and will return a json file with a ```status``` and a ```predictions``` key. With this ```predictions``` field, a list of class labels and their corresponding probabilities will be associated. The first element in the list corresponds to the prediction for the first string in the input list.\n\n\n![Swagger UI Screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)\n\nYou can also test it on the command line, for example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -d \"{ \\\"text\\\": [ \\\"I would like to punch you.\\\", \\\"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\\\" ]}\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5000/model/predict\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response like that below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"original_text\": \"I would like to punch you.\",\n      \"predictions\": {\n        \"toxic\": 0.9796434044837952,\n        \"severe_toxic\": 0.07256634533405304,\n        \"obscene\": 0.058431386947631836,\n        \"threat\": 0.8635178804397583,\n        \"insult\": 0.11121545732021332,\n        \"identity_hate\": 0.013826466165482998\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"original_text\": \"In hindsight, I do apologize for my previous statement.\",\n      \"predictions\": {\n        \"toxic\": 0.00029103411361575127,\n        \"severe_toxic\": 0.00012417171092238277,\n        \"obscene\": 0.0001522742968518287,\n        \"threat\": 8.440738747594878e-05,\n        \"insult\": 0.00016013211279641837,\n        \"identity_hate\": 0.00012860879360232502\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n",
