# DeepArtist
Develop an algorithm which will identify the artist when provided with a painting, with state of the art precision.

## Data
Best Artworks of All Time (https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time)

## Predictions:
The final model could identify the 50 artists with an approximate accuracy of 77.89% on training set and 77.81% on test set.

## Convolutional Base Model
EfficientNet B-7 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf)
