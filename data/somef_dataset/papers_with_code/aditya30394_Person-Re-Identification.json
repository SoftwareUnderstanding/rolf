      "excerpt": "For making sense of the vast quantity of visual data generated by the rapid expansion of large-scale distributed multi-camera systems, automated person re-identification is essential. Person re-identification, a tool used in intelligent video surveillance, is the task of correctly identifying individuals across multiple images captured under varied scenarios from multiple cameras. Solving this problem is inherently a challenging one because of the issues posed to it by low-resolution images, illumination changes per image, unconstrained pose and occlusions.  \nIn this project, we aim at developing a Person re-identification model using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) which can handle variable size input images. Specifically, we aim at implementing two preprocessing techniques, which reduce the chances of overfitting i.e. we aim to make our model robust to occlusion using Random Erasing, a data augmentation technique, and reduce the influence of pose variations on features using a Pose normalized Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).  \nAlong with this we also aim to implement and integrate Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB) to further improve on the results. We briefly describe the models trained along with their evaluation results on Market1501 dataset and provided validation and test sets. \n",
