As the need to employ deep learning and other machine learning techniques on graph structured data continues to increase, the effectiveness of various node embedding methods in representing the data accurately in a manner that can be fed directly into existing deep learning models is of increasing importance.  \n",

      "excerpt": "A large amount of yellow cab data from New York City is available to the public. Each trip record contains the latitude and longitude of the pickup and dropoff locations, the date and time of the pickup and dropoff, and additional information. We will construct a grid over NYC and create undirected graphs where an edge represents a trip between two points on the grid. The ultimate goal is to feed these graphs (each graph constituting a days worth of trips) into an LSTM network in order to predict the next days\u2019 trips. To do this we will test a selection of different node embedding methods on the graphs in order to feed the information into the LSTM. The different node embedding methods we will make use of are below:\no  Deep Walk\no  V2V: Vector Embedding\no  LINE: Large Scale Information Network Embedding\n\n",
