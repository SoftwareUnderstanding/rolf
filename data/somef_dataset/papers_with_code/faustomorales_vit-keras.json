      "excerpt": "This is a Keras implementation of the models described in An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: \nTransformes For Image Recognition at Scale. It is based on an earlier implementation from tuvovan, modified to match the Flax implementation in the official repository. \nThe weights here are ported over from the weights provided in the official repository. See utils.load_weights_numpy to see how this is done (it's not pretty, but it does the job). \nThere's some functionality for plotting attention maps for a given image and model. See example below. I'm not sure I'm doing this correctly (the official repository didn't have example code). Feedback /corrections welcome! \n",
