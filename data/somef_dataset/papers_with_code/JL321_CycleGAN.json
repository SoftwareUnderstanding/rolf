      "excerpt": "Cycle Consistent GANs are an adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks, in which the resulting model has the capability of performing domain adaptation between two datasets of varying domains. Again- unpaired! Images between datasets don't need to be directly matched, as the additional cycle consistency term added within the CycleGAN model allows for additional stability within training - of which pressures output domains to be consistent. \n",
