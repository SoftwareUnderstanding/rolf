There is only one computing graph in our implemention. However, we still split the dataset into several buckets and use data from the same bucket to create a batch. By doing so, we can add less padding, leading to a better efficiency. \n",

We refine the softmax function in attention so that paddings always get 0. \nFor simplicity and flexibility, we implement the beam search algorithm in python while leave the network part in tensorflow. In testing, we consider batch_size as beam_size. The tensorflow graph will generate only 1 word, then some python code will create a new batch according to the result. By iteratively doing so, beam search result is generated.  \nCheck step_beam(...) in bigru_model.py for details. \nWe train the model for 300k batches with batch size 80. We clip all summaries to 75 bytes. For DUC datasets, we eliminate EOS and generate 12 words. For GIGA dataset, we let the model to generate EOS. \n",
