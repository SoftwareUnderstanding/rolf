      "excerpt": "Webpage information extraction (WIE) is an important step to create knowledge bases. For this, classical WIE methods leverage the Document Object Model (DOM) tree of a website. However, use of the DOM tree poses significant challenges as context and appearance are encoded in an abstract manner. To address this challenge we propose to reformulate WIE as a context-aware Webpage Object Detection task. Specifically, we develop a Context-aware Visual Attention-based (CoVA) detection pipeline which combines appearance features with syntactical structure from the DOM tree. To study the approach we collect a new large-scale dataset of e-commerce websites for which we manually annotate every web element with four labels: product price, product title, product image and background. On this dataset we show that the proposed CoVA approach is a new challenging baseline which improves upon prior \nstate-of-the-art methods. \n",

      "excerpt": "We develop a Context-aware Visual Attention-based detection pipeline (CoVA), which is end-to-end trainable and exploits syntactic structure from the DOM tree along with screenshot images. CoVA uses a variant of Fast R-CNN to obtain a visual representation and graph attention for contextual learning on a graph constructed from the DOM tree. CoVA improves recent state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. \nWe create the largest public dataset of 7.7k product webpage screenshots from 408 online retailers for Object Detection from product webpages. Our dataset is &sim;10x larger than existing datasets. \nWe show the interpretability of CoVA using attention visualizations. \n",
