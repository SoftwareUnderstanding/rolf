#The Semantic Segmentation Project

This project is an attempt to collate popular neural net architectures that are used for semantic segmentation, and provide them for easy training and use for the beginner in semantic segmentation.

So far the following architectures are implemented:
1. Segnet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561)
2. U-Net  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
3. FCN    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038)

Additions are welcome!
