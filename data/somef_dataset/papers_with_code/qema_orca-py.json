      "excerpt": "Different from ORCA's original purpose, a main use case of this library is to use the orbit counts as features in machine learning for graph-structured data.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art in many graph learning domains, such as [biology](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/13/i457/5045770), [chemistry][http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7877-graph-convolutional-policy-network-for-goal-directed-molecular-graph-generation], [recommender systems][https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01973.pdf], among many others.\nSome of the example architectures include [GCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907), [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216) and [GAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903).\nPytorch Geometric and DGL are useful libraries for GNNs.\n\nIn addition to the Python version of the C++ ORCA interface, this repo also provide python interface to easily create feature vectors for nodes based on orbit counts. They can be used as utilities to supply additional input features for nodes in a GNN.\n",
