Clone this repository\n  ```Shell\n  #: Make sure to clone with --recursive\n  git clone --recursive https://github.com/vincentzhang/roi-fcn.git \n  ```\n  If you didn't clone with the `--recursive` flag, then you'll need to manually clone the `caffe-roi` submodule:\n  ```Shell\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n  ```\n\n2. Build Caffe and pycaffe\n  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!\n    ```Shell\n    #: ROOT refers to the directory that you cloned this repo into.\n    cd $ROOT/caffe-roi\n    #: Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:\n    #:   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html\n\n        #: In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented\n            WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1\n        #: Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN\n            USE_CUDNN := 1\n\n    #: Compile\n    make -j8 && make pycaffe\n    ```\n  You can download my [Makefile.config](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NSeWp7INxGWUrSdCTCwol8NmV_0-Ar5k) for reference.\n\n3. Build the Cython modules\n    ```Shell\n    cd $ROOT/lib\n    make\n    ```\n\n4. Download the ImageNet pre-trained VGG16 weights (adapted to be fully convolutional):\n    ```Shell\n    cd $ROOT/data/scripts\n    ./fetch_vgg16_fcn.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will populate the `$ROOT/data/imagenet_models` folder with `VGG16.v2.fcn-surgery-all.caffemodel`.\n\n",
