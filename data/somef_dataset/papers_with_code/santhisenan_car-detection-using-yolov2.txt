# Car detection using YOLOv2 
You Only Look Once (YOLO) is the state of the art, real time object 
detection system. 

* I have used the pre-trained model available at https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/.

* The original paper for YOLOv2 by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi
can be found in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)

* Find more about YOLOv2 in their [project webpage](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/).

* This implementation has taken significant inspiration from Allan Zelener's GitHub repository, [YAD2K: Yet Another Darknet 2 Keras](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K).
