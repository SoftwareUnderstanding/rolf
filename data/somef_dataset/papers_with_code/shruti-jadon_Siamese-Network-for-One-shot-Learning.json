Whereas most machine learning based object categorization algorithms require training on hundreds or thousands of images and very large datasets, one-shot learning aims to learn information about object categories from one, or only a few, training images.\n\nHow to Run it:\n```\nClone this repository\ngo to directory\npython Model/train_mnist.py \npython Model/test_contrastive.py\n```\nThe output of train_mnist will be saved as pickle, you can modify number of epochs.\n```\nTo test the embeddings obtained score:\npython Model/intracluster_score.py\n```\n\nSince One Shot Learning focuses on models which have a nonparametric approach of evaluation, we came across Kafnets(kernel based non-parametric activation functions) that have shown initial promise in this domain of training neural networks using different forms of activation functions; so as to increase non-linearity, therefore decreasing the number of layers, and increasing the accuracy in a lot of cases. This paper(https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04035) has proposed two activation functions KAF and KAF2D, and focuses on their nature of continuity and differentiability. We have taken help of implementations of these activation functions and compared their effectiveness against traditional ones when used in the context of One Shot learning.\n\n",
