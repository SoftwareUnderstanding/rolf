The text detection model provides a dense receptive field, for predicting text boxes in dense natural scene images like documents, articles etc.\n\nThe model is also inspired from [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2), where the **RRBOX** part and loss function is taken from.\n\nThe features of the model are summarized below:\n+ Keras implementation for lucid and clean code.\n+ Backbone: **Resnet50**\n+ Inference time for 720p images:\n\n    **GPU VERSION**\n    + Graphics Card: MX130\n    + Inference Time: 700ms\n    + Batch Size: 1\n   \n    **CPU VERSION**\n    + CPU: Intel i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz\n    + Inference Time: 1750ms\n    + Batch Size: 1\n\n+ The pre-trained model provided achieves **47.09**(Single Crop, Resize Only) F1-score on ICDAR 2015, but was not trained on ICDAR 2015. To improve accuracy fine-tune on ICDAR 2015, and predict with multiple crops.\n\n+ The model is tuned for predicting text boxes for natural scene documents, like bank statements, forms, recipts, etc, and evidently do OCR on these text boxes.\n\n\nPlease cite these [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07767), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2) if you find this useful.\n\n",
