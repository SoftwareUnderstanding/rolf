In this project, I created a Computer Vision based Naruto game.......BELIEVE IT!!!

I wrote a quick blog post about the project on my website https://engineeringsapien.com/narutocv-blog. You can learn more about it there. Click on the image above to get a peak of the game.

The aim was to bring the Naruto world to life. Namely, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize Naruto hand signs.

From there, I recreated a simplied version of the classic Naruto Arena game that incorporated the hand recognition model. The result: a game where you 'attack' by preforming Naruto-style hand signs to activate jutsus!

Currently, the only way to play it is to download the code from my github here. I have instructions for doing so on the blog post.

Disclaimer:
There are several parties for which I owe much credit to:

Naruto-Arena - The whole game idea was pretty much just a copy of Naruto Arena. Also, most of the character icons and attack icons I used in the game came from their website. So I owe the creators of that gem a big thank you. Naruto Arena was a legendary game to say the least. Here is the OG Naruto Arena website https://naruto-arena.net/

VGG16 - This is the deep learning model I used in this project. It is a model by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman. Here is their paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556

Brenner Heintz - A major help was Brenner Heintz. For a while, I struggled to get the model to learn anything and it wasn't until I came across Brenner's article (https://towardsdatascience.com/training-a-neural-network-to-detect-gestures-with-opencv-in-python-e09b0a12bdf1) did things start to come together. It was Brenner who convinced me to use the VGG16 model as well as thresholded images instead of colored images.
