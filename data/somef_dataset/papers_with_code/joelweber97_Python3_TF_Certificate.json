      "excerpt": "To practice what you've learned, a good idea would be to spend an hour on 3 of the following (3-hours total, you could through them all if you want) and then write a blog post about what you've learned.\n\n* For an overview of the different problems within NLP and how to solve them read through: \n  * [A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32)\n  * [How to solve 90% of NLP problems: a step-by-step guide](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e)\n* Go through [MIT's Recurrent Neural Networks lecture](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU). This will be one of the greatest additions to what's happening behind the RNN model's you've been building.\n* Read through the [word embeddings page on the TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings). Embeddings are such a large part of NLP. We've covered them throughout this notebook but extra practice would be well worth it. A good exercise would be to write out all the code in the guide in a new notebook. \n* For more on RNN's in TensorFlow, read and reproduce [the TensorFlow RNN guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn). We've covered many of the concepts in this guide, but it's worth writing the code again for yourself.\n* Text data doesn't always come in a nice package like the data we've downloaded. So if you're after more on preparing different text sources for being with your TensorFlow deep learning models, it's worth checking out the following:\n  * [TensorFlow text loading tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/text).\n  * [Reading text files with Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/) by Real Python.\n* This notebook has focused on writing NLP code. For a mathematically rich overview of how NLP with Deep Learning happens, read [Standford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning lecture notes Part 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf).  \n  * For an even deeper dive, you could even do the whole [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) course. \n* Great blog posts to read:\n  * Andrei Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) dives into generating Shakespeare text with RNNs.\n  * [Text Classification with NLP: Tf-Idf vs Word2Vec vs BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-nlp-tf-idf-vs-word2vec-vs-bert-41ff868d1794) by Mauro Di Pietro. An overview of different techniques for turning text into numbers and then classifying it.\n  * [What are word embeddings?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) by Machine Learning Mastery.\n* Other topics worth looking into:\n  * [Attention mechanisms](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/). These are a foundational component of the transformer architecture and also often add improvments to deep NLP models.\n  * [Transformer architectures](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). This model architecture has recently taken the NLP world by storm, achieving state of the art on many benchmarks. However, it does take a little more processing to get off the ground, the [HuggingFace Models (formerly HuggingFace Transformers) library](https://huggingface.co/models/) is probably your best quick start.\n\n---\n\n",

That\u2019s good enough. If you don\u2019t know what that means, spend another month or two writing Python code and then come back here.\n* **At least one beginner machine learning course.** Are you familiar with the idea of training, validation and test sets? Do you know what supervised learning is? Have you used pandas, NumPy or Matplotlib before? If no to any of these, I\u2019d going through at least one machine learning course which teaches these first and then coming back. \n* **Comfortable using Google Colab/Jupyter Notebooks.** This course uses Google Colab throughout. If you have never used Google Colab before, it works very similar to Jupyter Notebooks with a few extra features. If you\u2019re not familiar with Google Colab notebooks, I\u2019d suggest going through the Introduction to Google Colab notebook.\n* **Plug:** The [Zero to Mastery beginner-friendly machine learning course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse) (I also teach this) teaches all of the above (and this course is designed as a follow on).\n\n",

Make prediction intervals for future forecasts. To do so, one way would be to train an ensemble model on all of the data, make future forecasts with it and calculate the prediction intervals of the ensemble just like we did for `model_8`.\n7. For future predictions, try to make a prediction, retrain a model on the predictions, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction (retrain a model each time a new prediction is made). Plot the results, how do they look compared to the future predictions where a model wasn't retrained for every forecast (`model_9`)?\n8.
