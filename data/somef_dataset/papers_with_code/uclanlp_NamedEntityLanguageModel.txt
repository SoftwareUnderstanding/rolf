## This is the codebase of the paper: Building Language Model for Text with Named Enitities, [Rizwan et., al., (ACL, 18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04836).

##### 1. Setting the [data path](https://github.com/rizwan09/awd-lstm-lm/tree/master/data) accordingly, we use command ``python3 main.py`` with default params to train baseline AWD_LSTM model, and type model. [uncleaned data is here](https://github.com/rizwan09/awd-lstm-lm/tree/master/raw_data).
##### 2. To train entity composite model we use command ``python3 main_ori_with_type.py`` with default params. 
##### 3. At inference, we use ``inference.py`` file.

##### 4. To reproduce our result, simply run command ``python3 inference_loaded.py`` of [full_pretrained_project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhFvOHDQcTV7_gJ5BhAqccG4otRWIdLY?usp=sharing) which will use the already trained models. In this version, we also show that with our joint inference schema, AWD_LSTM itself can work suffciiently well and replace the entity composite model. Also note that we used nltk tokenizer while annotationg the types in this version. So it is slightly different from our current release. 

##### 5. The corresponding data are in awd-lstm-lm/data folder in the link shared above.

##### 6. The uncleaned datasets are also relesead for future challenge (can be found in awd-lstm-lm/recipies/data/corpus in the google drive path shared above)

#### 7. The code corpus can be found at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DJev2PwKBAPlUMy-OsT4kKVlTM1Mj_XN?usp=sharing). Although we report basic LSTM performance in the paper, running the AWD_LSTM model on this dataset may give better result. To reproduce our result, run with inference3.py from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fY0n89bWE_vGwKgNYWAhY_4_HjNLlwXy?usp=sharing). Please note that, for the code corpus,  as the variable scope is limited to each method, the context is initialized anew for each method instance. To train either a simple Type model or original state-of-art language model (i.e., both of forward and backward LSTM) main.py (python3 main.py) is used with respective data file, and for training an entity composite model main2.py (``python3 main2.py`` is used. inference3.py does the the joint inference laterwards. Another important note is this version does NOT support cuda. Our code does not support 'bidir' rather it computes forward and bckward seperately.

## About Baseline (forked from the baseline source code path)


## AWD-LSTM / AWD-QRNN Language Model

### Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent with Weight Dropped LSTM or QRNN

This repository contains the code used for [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/)'s [Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182) paper, originally forked from the [PyTorch word level language modeling example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model).
The model comes with instructions to train a word level language model over the Penn Treebank (PTB) and [WikiText-2](https://einstein.ai/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset) (WT2) datasets, though the model is likely extensible to many other datasets.
The model can be composed of an LSTM or a [Quasi-Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn/) (QRNN) which is two or more times faster than the cuDNN LSTM in this setup while achieving equivalent or better accuracy.

+ Install PyTorch 0.2
+ Run `getdata.sh` to acquire the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets
+ Train the base model using `main.py`
+ Finetune the model using `finetune.py`
+ Apply the [continuous cache pointer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04426) to the finetuned model using `pointer.py`

If you need to use an earlier version of the codebase, the original code and hyper parameters accessible at the [PyTorch==0.1.12](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm/tree/PyTorch%3D%3D0.1.12) release, with Python 3 and PyTorch 0.1.12 are required.
If you are using Anaconda, installation of PyTorch 0.1.12 can be achieved via:
`conda install pytorch=0.1.12 -c soumith`.


### Experiments For recipe dataset
##### python main.py --batch_size 20 --data ../data/recipe_ori/ --dropouti 0.4 --dropouth 0.25 --seed 141 --epoch 50 --save RCP_LSTM_ori_with_type.pt

##### python main.py --batch_size 20 --data ../data/recipe_type/ --dropouti 0.4 --dropouth 0.25 --seed 141 --epoch 50 --save RCP_type_LSTM_one_vocab.pt 

## Experiments
The codebase was modified during the writing of the paper, preventing exact reproduction due to minor differences in random seeds or similar.
We have also seen exact reproduction numbers change when changing underlying GPU.
The guide below produces results largely similar to the numbers reported.

For data setup, run `./getdata.sh`.
This script collects the Mikolov pre-processed Penn Treebank and the WikiText-2 datasets and places them in the `data` directory.

Next, decide whether to use the QRNN or the LSTM as the underlying recurrent neural network model.
The QRNN is many times faster than even Nvidia's cuDNN optimized LSTM (and dozens of times faster than a naive LSTM implementation) yet achieves similar or better results than the LSTM.
At the time of writing, the QRNN models use the same number of parameters and are slightly deeper networks but are two to four times faster per epoch and require less epochs to converge.

The QRNN model uses a QRNN with convolutional size 2 for the first layer, allowing the model to view discrete natural language inputs (i.e. "New York"), while all other layers use a convolutional size of 1.

**Finetuning Note:** Fine-tuning modifies the original saved model `model.pt` file - if you wish to keep the original weights you must copy the file.

**Pointer note:** BPTT just changes the length of the sequence pushed onto the GPU but won't impact the final result.

### Penn Treebank (PTB) with LSTM

The instruction below trains a PTB model that without finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `61.2` / `58.8` (validation / testing), with finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `58.8` / `56.5`, and with the continuous cache pointer augmentation achieves perplexities of approximately `53.2` / `52.5`.

### Penn Treebank (PTB) with QRNN

The instruction below trains a QRNN model that without finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `60.6` / `58.3` (validation / testing), with finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `59.1` / `56.7`, and with the continuous cache pointer augmentation achieves perplexities of approximately `53.4` / `52.6`.

+ `python -u main.py --model QRNN --batch_size 20 --clip 0.2 --wdrop 0.1 --nhid 1550 --nlayers 4 --emsize 400 --dropouth 0.3 --seed 9001 --dropouti 0.4 --epochs 550 --save PTB.pt`

+ `python pointer.py --model QRNN --lambdasm 0.1 --theta 1.0 --window 500 --bptt 5000 --save PTB.pt`

### WikiText-2 (WT2) with LSTM
The instruction below trains a PTB model that without finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `68.7` / `65.6` (validation / testing), with finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `67.4` / `64.7`, and with the continuous cache pointer augmentation achieves perplexities of approximately `52.2` / `50.6`.

### WikiText-2 (WT2) with QRNN

The instruction below will a QRNN model that without finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `69.3` / `66.8` (validation / testing), with finetuning achieves perplexities of approximately `68.5` / `65.9`, and with the continuous cache pointer augmentation achieves perplexities of approximately `53.6` / `52.1`.
Better numbers are likely achievable but the hyper parameters have not been extensively searched. These hyper parameters should serve as a good starting point however.

+ `python -u main.py --epochs 500 --data data/wikitext-2 --clip 0.25 --dropouti 0.4 --dropouth 0.2 --nhid 1550  --nlayers 4 --seed 4002 --model QRNN --wdrop 0.1 --batch_size 40 --save WT2.pt`

+ `python -u pointer.py --save WT2.pt --model QRNN --lambdasm 0.1279 --theta 0.662 --window 3785 --bptt 2000 --data data/wikitext-2`

## Speed

The default speeds for the models during training on an NVIDIA Quadro GP100:

+ Penn Treebank (batch size 20): LSTM takes 65 seconds per epoch, QRNN takes 28 seconds per epoch
+ WikiText-2 (batch size 20): LSTM takes 180 seconds per epoch, QRNN takes 90 seconds per epoch

The default QRNN models can be far faster than the cuDNN LSTM model, with the speed-ups depending on how much of a bottleneck the RNN is. The majority of the model time above is now spent in softmax or optimization overhead (see [PyTorch QRNN discussion on speed](https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn#speed)).

Speeds are approximately three times slower on a K80. On a K80 or other memory cards with less memory you may wish to enable [the cap on the maximum sampled sequence length](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm/blob/ef9369d277f8326b16a9f822adae8480b6d492d0/main.py#L131) to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially for WikiText-2.

If speed is a major issue, SGD converges more quickly than our non-monotonically triggered variant of ASGD though achieves a worse overall perplexity.

### Details of the QRNN optimization

For full details, refer to the [PyTorch QRNN repository](https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn).

### Details of the LSTM optimization

All the augmentations to the LSTM, including our variant of [DropConnect (Wan et al. 2013)](https://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/dropc.pdf) termed weight dropping which adds recurrent dropout, allow for the use of NVIDIA's cuDNN LSTM implementation.
PyTorch will automatically use the cuDNN backend if run on CUDA with cuDNN installed.
This ensures the model is fast to train even when convergence may take many hundreds of epochs.
