# Tacotron 2 MMI (without wavenet)
# code for Maximizing Mutual Information for Tacotron.
An updated version of the method purposed in the avoue paper.
 - gradient adaptor factor for the CTC loss instead of an increasing weight.
 - an extremely simple CTC recognizer (1 linear layer with ReLU activation) is used to force the Tacotron decoder 
 to learn a representation with plentiful linguistic information. The CTC recognizer is able to classify 
 raw acoustic features if it employs a powerful structure.

New options in hparams:
 - use_mmi (use mmi training objective or not)
 - use_gaf (use gradient adaptive factor or not, to keep the max norm of gradients 
 from the taco_loss and mi_loss approximately equal)
 - max_gaf (maximum value of gradient adaptive factor)
 - drop_frame_rate (drop teacher-frocing input frames to a certain rate)
 
This code can pick up alignment at much earlier steps than the original version.

---------------------------
                    

PyTorch implementation of [Natural TTS Synthesis By Conditioning
Wavenet On Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf). 

This implementation includes **distributed** and **automatic mixed precision** support
and uses the [LJSpeech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).

Distributed and Automatic Mixed Precision support relies on NVIDIA's [Apex] and [AMP].

Visit our [website] for audio samples using our published [Tacotron 2] and
[WaveGlow] models.

## Pre-requisites
1. NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN

## Setup
1. Download and extract the [LJ Speech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2.git`
3. CD into this repo: `cd tacotron2`
4. Initialize submodule: `git submodule init; git submodule update`
5. Update .wav paths: `sed -i -- 's,DUMMY,ljs_dataset_folder/wavs,g' filelists/*.txt`
    - Alternatively, set `load_mel_from_disk=True` in `hparams.py` and update mel-spectrogram paths 
6. Install [PyTorch 1.0]
7. Install [Apex]
8. Install python requirements or build docker image 
    - Install python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training
1. `python train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir`
2. (OPTIONAL) `tensorboard --logdir=outdir/logdir`

## Training using a pre-trained model
Training using a pre-trained model can lead to faster convergence  
By default, the dataset dependent text embedding layers are [ignored]

1. Download our published [Tacotron 2] model
2. `python train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir -c tacotron2_statedict.pt --warm_start`

## Multi-GPU (distributed) and Automatic Mixed Precision Training
1. `python -m multiproc train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir --hparams=distributed_run=True,fp16_run=True`

## Inference demo
1. Download our published [Tacotron 2] model
2. Download our published [WaveGlow] model
3. `jupyter notebook --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=31337`
4. Load inference.ipynb 

N.b.  When performing Mel-Spectrogram to Audio synthesis, make sure Tacotron 2
and the Mel decoder were trained on the same mel-spectrogram representation.
