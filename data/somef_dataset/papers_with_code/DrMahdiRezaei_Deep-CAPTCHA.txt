# Deep-CAPTCHA
Solving CAPTCHAs using Convolutional Neural Network

This project aims at predicting and solving python-generated CAPTCHAs, using Convolutional Neural Network to detect the vulnerability of the CAPTCHAs. By running the program, a specific amount of CAPTCHAs will be generated in a folder which then is used as the training set of the network.

## How to run?
To run the code, the following python packages are required:
- captcha 
- opencv-python
- opencv-python-headless
- opencv-contrib-python-headless
- keras

Also, the following Linux packages are required:
- libsm6
- libxext6

To run the code open [Captcha_Solver_Alphanumerical.ipynb] or [Captcha_Solver_numerical.ipynb] in Jupiter notebook and then run them.
