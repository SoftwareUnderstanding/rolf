In addition, example usage is provided by means of a language model tranined on a small baking cookbook. \nThe architecture implemented in this repository is similiar to that described in the paper: Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training [2], in that it can be thought of as a standalone decoder component from [1] that omits the attention layer which interfaces with an encoder. However, whereas the implementation in [2] makes some additional architectural changes, this implementation stays true to the original description in [1]. \nFigure 1: Left: The original transformer from [1], Middle: The implementation in this repository, Right: OpenAI's transformer from [2]. \nKeras/Tensorflow implementation of the architecture in Figure 1. \nLanguage model trained on a small baking cookbook. \n",
