The code has been updated so that baseline scores more closely follow those of the original MAML paper.\n\nCode in protonet folder is based on the implementation from [**MetaOptNet**](https://github.com/kjunelee/MetaOptNet). All .py files in this folder except for dataloaders.py and optimize.py were adopted from this implementation and modified afterwards.
