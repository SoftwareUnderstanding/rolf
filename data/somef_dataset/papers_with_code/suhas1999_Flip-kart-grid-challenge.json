      "excerpt": "    With the independent feature being the image itself and the dependent feature being two set of coordinates, our approach revolves around building a standard Convolutional Neural Network. The architecture of the CNN used is ResNet50,Resnet18 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). A custom head is added to the CNN to get the desired 4 numbers as output. \nSome key techniques used to improve the model:- \n    1.) Data Augmentation.(Changing the brightness, contrast, rotation, zooming, warping of the given images to artificialy generate more data.) \n",
