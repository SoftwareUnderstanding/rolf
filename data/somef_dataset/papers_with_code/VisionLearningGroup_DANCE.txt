## Environment
Python 3.6.9, Pytorch 1.2.0, Torch Vision 0.4, [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex). See requirement.txt.
 We used the nvidia apex library for memory efficient high-speed training.

## Data Preparation

[Office Dataset](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/)
[OfficeHome Dataset](http://hemanthdv.org/OfficeHome-Dataset/) [VisDA](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/taskcv-2017-public/tree/master/classification)

Prepare dataset in data directory as follows.
```
./data/amazon/images/ ## Office
./data/Real/ ## OfficeHome
./data/visda_train/ ## VisDA synthetic images
./data/visda_val/ ## VisDA real images
```
Prepare image list.
```
unzip txt.zip
```
File list has to be stored in ./txt.


## Train

All training script is stored in script directory.

Example: Open Set Domain Adaptation on Office.
```
sh script/run_office_obda.sh $gpu-id configs/office-train-config_ODA.yaml
```
