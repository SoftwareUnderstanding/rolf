1) NYC Taxi project - Analysis of trip data of NYC taxi for prediction of tip. This is a common data scienct project in the net. In my solution, I have tried to look at the statistical distribution of tip data

2) K-sparse autoencoder - Image classification using Imagenet data (http://image-net.org/). This is an implementation of the algorith from the paper - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5663v2.pdf

3) tensorflow autoencoder - Autoencoder implemented on the imagenet dataset using TensorFlow
