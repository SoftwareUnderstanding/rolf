What was the weather like 500 years ago? What happened when Mt. Fuji erupted? How can one fold 100 cranes using only one piece of paper? The answers to these questions are in those books. \nJapan has millions of books and over a billion historical documents such as personal letters or diaries preserved nationwide. Most of them cannot be read by the majority of Japanese people living today because they were written in \u201cKuzushiji\u201d. \nEven though Kuzushiji, a cursive writing style, had been used in Japan for over a thousand years, there are very few fluent readers of Kuzushiji today (only 0.01% of modern Japanese natives). Due to the lack of available human resources, there has been a great deal of interest in using Machine Learning to automatically recognize these historical texts and transcribe them into modern Japanese characters. Nevertheless, several challenges in Kuzushiji recognition have made the performance of existing systems extremely poor.  \nThe hosts need help from machine learning experts to transcribe Kuzushiji into contemporary Japanese characters. With your help, Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH) will be able to develop better algorithms for Kuzushiji recognition. The model is not only a great contribution to the machine learning community, but also a great help for making millions of documents more accessible and leading to new discoveries in Japanese history and culture. \n",

      "excerpt": "Our approach to detection was directly inspired by K_mat's kernel, with the main takeaway being the idea of predicting a heatmap showing the centers of characters. Initially, we used a U-Net with a resnet18 backbone to predict a heatmap consisting of ellipses placed at the centers of characters, with the radii proportional to the width and height of the bounding box, with the input to the model being a 1024x1024 pixel crop of the page resized to 256x256 pixels.  \nPredictions for the centers were then obtained by picking the local maxima (note that the width and height of the bounding box were not predicted). Performance was improved by changing the ellipses to circles of constant radius. \nWe tried using focal loss and binary cross-entropy as loss functions, but using mean squared error resulted in the cleanest predictions for us (though more epochs were needed to get sensible-looking predictions). \nOne issue with using 1024x1024 crops of the page as the input were \"artifacts\" around the edges of the input. We tried a few things to try to counteract this, such as moving the sliding window over the page with a stride less than 1024x1024, then removing duplicate predictions by detecting when two predicted points of the same class were within a certain distance of each other. However, these did not give an improvement on the LB - we think that tuning parameters for these methods on the validation set, as well as the parameters for selecting maxima in the heatmap, might have caused us to \"overfit\". \nThese artifacts were related with the drawings and annotations! \n",
