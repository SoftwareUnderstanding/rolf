      "excerpt": "The ConvNet architecture is pretty straightforward, and was achieved through lots and lots of trail and error.  \nI found that more layers is better, and anything more than 32 filters per layer lead to overfitting. Too many layers also lead to overfitting. I trained many many models, and this specific architecture was quite resilient to overfitting fortunately. Anyone who wants to improve on this ConvNet, I recommend you play around with strides and kernel sizes since I did not really alter them.  \nSingle Shot Detector (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf) is a bit more complicated.  It's quite fascinating how the SSD works. Long story short, the model detects 100 boxes, each box having its own probability distribution of all the classes. And every box has a score that something is in it (since most of the bounding boxes will contain nothing). Thus the SSD outputs a very long array. Let's say you trained it on 3 classes. Each box would correspond to an array of size 8: 4 numbers for the box center, length, and height; 3 numbers for the class distribution, and 1 number for the box score. Since the SSD outputs 100 boxes, this would correpsond to the SSD outputting an 800-element array. In my case, there was only one class: hand.   \n",
