      "excerpt": "There has been remarkable progress on object detection and re-identification in recent years which are the core components for multi-object tracking. However, little attention has been focused on accomplishing the two tasks in a single network to improve the inference speed. The initial attempts along this path ended up with degraded results mainly because the re-identification branch is not appropriately learned. In this work, we study the essential reasons behind the failure, and accordingly present a simple baseline to addresses the problems. It remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the MOT challenge datasets at 30 FPS. We hope this baseline could inspire and help evaluate new ideas in this field. \n",
