      "excerpt": "Images are increasingly available from a variety of sources, including nano-satellites, drones and conventional high altitude satellites. The data is available: the task is to produce intervention-specific maps with the relevant features and in a short timeframe. Thus, the goal is to train a model which given a new tile can annotate all buildings.   \nHere a U-Net model is used with VGG11 as encoder. Also, a separate script to detect the land changes over time is provided to detect and calculate the difference in the landscape \n",
