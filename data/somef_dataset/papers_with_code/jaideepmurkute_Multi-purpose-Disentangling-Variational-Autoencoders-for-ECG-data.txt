# Multi-purpose-Disentangling-Variational-Autoencoders-for-ECG-data
**Work In Progress**

**PyTorch Implementations of 1-D CNN VAE architectures for learning frameworks presented in following papers:**     
1] Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes,  
   Diederik P. Kingma, Max Welling,  
   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf    
2] beta-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework  
   Higgins et. al  
   https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl  
3] IBP-VAE:   
   Gyawali, et. al  
   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01839.pdf   
4] Group-based Learning of Disentangled Representations with Generalizability for Novel Contents

**All architectures are supported with:**    
1] Unsupervised Learning  
2] Conditional Learning (VAE decoder conditioned on learnable class labels)  
3] Deterministic classification network  
  
**Uses 1-dimensional convolutional neural network for VAEs.**  
**All dependencies are in requirements.txt file**
