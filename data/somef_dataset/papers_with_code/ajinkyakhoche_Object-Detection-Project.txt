# Object-Detection-Project

The project is based on the previous work on the SSD Keras project https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras which originally was  introduced by Wei Liu et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325.

The aim is to perform experiements with the SSD mobilenet framework for faster and lighter object detection on custom data. The work is in progress and therefore not complete.
