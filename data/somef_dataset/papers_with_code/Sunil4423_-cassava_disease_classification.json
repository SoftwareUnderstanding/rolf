      "excerpt": "Cassava plant is an important source of food in the world.  \nThis plant is vulnerable to a number of viruses. \nIn this project, we fine tune the pretrained Inception V3 deep CNN trained on ImageNet  \nto identify the type of disease that a given plant is infected with. \nThe data used in this project are based on the Cassava Fine-Grained Visual Categorization Challenge. \nWe work with a dataset with a relatively small size. So during the training, we use image augmentation in order to  \nhelp the model generelize better. This includes applying a set of transformation to the images during the batch training. These transformations include: shearing, flipping, shifting, etc. \nThe core of the archituecture of our CNN model is the Inception_V3 deep CNN model, which was trained on the Imagnet data. We drop the last fully connected layers of Inception and replace them with a fully connect layer of 512 hidden units and lastly a softmax layer for the multi-lable classification task. \nIn order to get an intuition of how the CNN work, we take a look at the activation maps. \nThe first convolutional layers capture the low level features such as the edges of objects while the last convolutional layers extract the more high level features. \nWhen we test the perforemance of the model with the unseen examples we achieve an overall accuracy of 83% which can be a bit misleading since the dataset is imbalanced. So we compute the precision, recall, and F1-score of the individual categories. \nThese metrics are listed in the table below: \n",
