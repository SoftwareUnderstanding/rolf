Learning to Translate in Real-time with Neural Machine Translation
===================================
Translation in Real-time, a.k.a, Simultaneous Translation.

This code is the Theano implementation of the EACL2017 paper [Learning to Translate in Real-time with Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00388). It is based on the dl4mt-tutorial (https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial).

Dependencies:
----------------------
### Python 2.7
* Theano 0.8.2 (cuda 8.0, cudnn v5)
* seaborn, pandas (for drawing the heatmap)
* NLTK 3.2.1

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing and evaluation scripts are from [MOSES](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder).

Dataset:
----------------------
We used the WMT'15 corpora as our training set for both pretraining the NMT model and training the Simultaneous NMT model.
The original WMT'15 corpora can be downloaded from [here](http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/translation-task.html). 
For the preprocessed corpora used in our experiments, both the source and target datasets are preprocessed using byte-pair encoding (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909, https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt).

Pretraining:
----------------------
Before training the agent for simultaneous translation, the underlined translation model requires pretraining.
In our experiments, we pretrained single-layer undirectional NMT for both RU-EN and DE-EN corpora for both directions.

* We provided the preprocessed dataset and the pretrained models: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0miOG3ks5c1SVljM1Q5SURibU0?usp=sharing)

### Pretrain your own model:
Follow the instructions and setup the configurations in `config.py (pretrain_config)` and then excute:
```bash
$ export THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu,floatX=float32
$ python pretrain_uni.py
```
It normally takes 1~2 weeks for training an unidirectional NMT model for WMT15 corpora.

### Evaluate the BLEU score for a pre-trained NMT model
TBA.

Simultaneous Translation:
----------------------
### Training an Agent
Follow the instructions and setup the configurations in `config.py (rl_config)` and then excute:
```bash
$ export THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu,floatX=float32
$ python simultrans_train.py
```
### Monitoring
TBA.

### Visualization
