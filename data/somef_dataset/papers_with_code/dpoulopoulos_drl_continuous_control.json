      "excerpt": "Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. \nFor game developers, these trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behaviour (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. \nIn this project, we develop a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent that utilises its newly acquired skills to control a robotic arm, and steer it to a target location. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible. \nThe state space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. To solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes. \n",

      "excerpt": "To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.\n\n1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.\n\n\t- __Linux__ or __Mac__:\n\t```bash\n\tconda create --name drl_cc python=3.6\n\tsource activate drl_cc\n\t```\n\t- __Windows__:\n\t```bash\n\tconda create --name drl_cc python=3.6\n\tactivate drl_cc\n\t```\n\n2. Install Dependencies\n\n    - Install Pytoch by following the instructions for your system [here](https://pytorch.org/)\n\n    - To install the necessary dependencies run `pip install ./python`\n\n3. Download the Unity Environment\n\nFor this project, you will not need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:\n\n* Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)\n* Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)\n* Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)\n* Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)\n\n4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drl_cc` environment.  \n```bash\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name drl_cc--display-name \"drl_cc\"\n```\n\n5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drl_cc` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.\n\n",
