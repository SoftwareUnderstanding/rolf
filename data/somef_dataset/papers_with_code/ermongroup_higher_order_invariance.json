With our methods, we are able to get accelerated convergence for deep neural network training and higher sample efficiency for deep reinforcement learning. \nWe can observe that for a simple objective where ODEs can be solved accurately, midpoint integrators and geodesic correction methods give much more invariant optimization trajectories than vanilla natural gradient. \n",
