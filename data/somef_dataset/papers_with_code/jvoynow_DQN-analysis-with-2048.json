Q-learning, a popular method of RL, has been shown to solve wide varieties of diverse environments. Due to the vigorous study/use of Q-learning, engineers and researchers have developed various add-ons and improvements to this algorithm. Using the once popular game 2048 as our environment, we will analyze these improvements to find the optimal Q-learning policy. \nPlaying Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning, Google Deepmind:<br> \n",
