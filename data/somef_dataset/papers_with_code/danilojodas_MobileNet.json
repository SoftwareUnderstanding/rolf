      "excerpt": "A MobileNetV1 network was developed to identify images of the airplane models Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. A dataset with over 2000 images of each airplane model was created to train the CNN model. Another dataset with over 300 images of each airplane model was also create to validate the performance of the network.\n\nThe training dataset contains 2442 images of the Airbus A320 model and 2309 images of the Boeing 737. The validation dataset contains 487 images of the Airbus A320 and 335 images of the Boeing 737. Therefore, 4751 images were used for training the model and 822 images were used for validation.\n\n**Warning 1: Unfortunately it is not possible to provide the images used in the training and validation of the network due to the restricted Copyright policy.**\n\n**Warning 2: Since I used Google Colab for evaluating the model, I have used the images stored in my Google Drive account. However, you can change the path string that contains your own local or remote image set.**\n\n",
