UMAP adds a requirement for ``numba`` for\nperformance reasons. The original version used Cython, but the improved code\nclarity, simplicity and performance of Numba made the transition necessary.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Python 3.6 or greater\n* numpy\n* scipy\n* scikit-learn\n* numba\n* tqdm\n\nRecommended packages:\n\n* `pynndescent <https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent>`_\n* For plotting\n   * matplotlib\n   * datashader\n   * holoviews\n* for Parametric UMAP  \n   * tensorflow > 2.0.0\n\n\nInstalling pynndescent can significantly increase performance, and in later versions\nit will become a hard dependency.\n\n**Install Options**\n\nConda install, via the excellent work of the conda-forge team:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge umap-learn\n\nThe conda-forge packages are available for Linux, OS X, and Windows 64 bit.\n\nPyPI install, presuming you have numba and sklearn and all its requirements\n(numpy and scipy",

This parameter is set to 0.3 by default. Note that densMAP switches density optimization on after an initial phase of optimizing the embedding using UMAP. \ndens_lambda: This determines the weight of the density-preservation objective. Higher values prioritize density preservation, and lower values (closer to zero) prioritize the UMAP objective. Setting this parameter to zero reduces the algorithm to UMAP. Default value is 2.0. \ndens_var_shift: Regularization term added to the variance of local densities in the embedding for numerical stability. We recommend setting this parameter to 0.1, which consistently works well in many settings. \noutput_dens: When this flag is True, the call to fit_transform returns, in addition to the embedding, the local radii (inverse measure of local density defined in the densMAP paper &lt;https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.077776&gt;_) for the original dataset and for the embedding. The output is a tuple (embedding, radii_original, radii_embedding). Note that the radii are log-transformed. If False, only the embedding is returned. This flag can also be used with UMAP to explore the local densities of UMAP embeddings. By default this flag is False. \nFor densMAP we recommend larger values of n_neighbors (e.g. 30) for reliable estimation of local density. \nAn example of making use of these options (based on a subsample of the mnist_784 dataset): \n",

      "excerpt": "UMAP depends upon ``scikit-learn``, and thus ``scikit-learn``'s dependencies\nsuch as ``numpy`` and ``scipy``. UMAP adds a requirement for ``numba`` for\nperformance reasons. The original version used Cython, but the improved code\nclarity, simplicity and performance of Numba made the transition necessary.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Python 3.6 or greater\n* numpy\n* scipy\n* scikit-learn\n* numba\n* tqdm\n\nRecommended packages:\n\n* `pynndescent <https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent>`_\n* For plotting\n   * matplotlib\n   * datashader\n   * holoviews\n* for Parametric UMAP  \n   * tensorflow > 2.0.0\n\n\nInstalling pynndescent can significantly increase performance, and in later versions\nit will become a hard dependency.\n\n**Install Options**\n\nConda install, via the excellent work of the conda-forge team:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge umap-learn\n\nThe conda-forge packages are available for Linux, OS X, and Windows 64 bit.\n\nPyPI install, presuming you have numba and sklearn and all its requirements\n(numpy and scipy) installed:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install umap-learn\n\nIf you wish to use the plotting functionality you can use\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install umap-learn[plot]\n\nto install all the plotting dependencies.\n\nIf you wish to use Parametric UMAP, you need to install Tensorflow, which can be\ninstalled either using the instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install \n(reccomended) or using \n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install umap-learn[parametric_umap]\n\nfor a CPU-only version of Tensorflow.\n\nIf pip is having difficulties pulling the dependencies then we'd suggest installing\nthe dependencies manually using anaconda followed by pulling umap from pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    conda install numpy scipy\n    conda install scikit-learn\n    conda install numba\n    pip install umap-learn\n\nFor a manual install get this package:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    wget https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/archive/master.zip\n    unzip master.zip\n    rm master.zip\n    cd umap-master\n\nInstall the requirements\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nor\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    conda install scikit-learn numba\n\nInstall the package\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n---------------\n",

      "excerpt": "The umap package inherits from sklearn classes, and thus drops in neatly\nnext to other sklearn transformers with an identical calling API.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import umap\n    from sklearn.datasets import load_digits\n\n    digits = load_digits()\n\n    embedding = umap.UMAP().fit_transform(digits.data)\n\nThere are a number of parameters that can be set for the UMAP class; the\nmajor ones are as follows:\n\n -  ``n_neighbors``: This determines the number of neighboring points used in\n    local approximations of manifold structure. Larger values will result in\n    more global structure being preserved at the loss of detailed local\n    structure. In general this parameter should often be in the range 5 to\n    50, with a choice of 10 to 15 being a sensible default.\n\n -  ``min_dist``: This controls how tightly the embedding is allowed compress\n    points together. Larger values ensure embedded points are more evenly\n    distributed, while smaller values allow the algorithm to optimise more\n    accurately with regard to local structure. Sensible values are in the\n    range 0.001 to 0.5, with 0.1 being a reasonable default.\n\n -  ``metric``: This determines the choice of metric used to measure distance\n    in the input space. A wide variety of metrics are already coded, and a user\n    defined function can be passed as long as it has been JITd by numba.\n\nAn example of making use of these options:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import umap\n    from sklearn.datasets import load_digits\n\n    digits = load_digits()\n\n    embedding = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=5,\n                          min_dist=0.3,\n                          metric='correlation').fit_transform(digits.data)\n\nUMAP also supports fitting to sparse matrix data.

      "excerpt": "UMAP is very efficient at embedding large high dimensional datasets. In\nparticular it scales well with both input dimension and embedding dimension.\nFor the best possible performance we recommend installing the nearest neighbor\ncomputation library `pynndescent <https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent>`_ .\nUMAP will work without it, but if installed it will run faster, particularly on\nmulticore machines.\n\nFor a problem such as the 784-dimensional MNIST digits dataset with\n70000 data samples, UMAP can complete the embedding in under a minute (as\ncompared with around 45 minutes for scikit-learn's t-SNE implementation).\nDespite this runtime efficiency, UMAP still produces high quality embeddings.\n\nThe obligatory MNIST digits dataset, embedded in 42 \nseconds (with pynndescent installed and after numba jit warmup)\nusing a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 processor (n_neighbors=10, min_dist=0.001):\n\n.. image:: images/umap_example_mnist1.png\n    :alt: UMAP embedding of MNIST digits\n\nThe MNIST digits dataset is fairly straightforward, however. A better test is\nthe more recent \"Fashion MNIST\" dataset of images of fashion items (again\n70000 data sample in 784 dimensions). UMAP\nproduced this embedding in 49 seconds (n_neighbors=5, min_dist=0.1):\n\n.. image:: images/umap_example_fashion_mnist1.png\n    :alt: UMAP embedding of \"Fashion MNIST\"\n\nThe UCI shuttle dataset (43500 sample in 8 dimensions) embeds well under\n*correlation* distance in 44 seconds (note the longer time\nrequired for correlation distance computations):\n\n.. image:: images/umap_example_shuttle.png\n    :alt: UMAP embedding the UCI Shuttle dataset\n\nThe following is a densMAP visualization of the MNIST digits dataset with 784 features\nbased on the same parameters as above (n_neighbors=10, min_dist=0.001). densMAP reveals\nthat the cluster corresponding to digit 1 is noticeably denser, suggesting that\nthere are fewer degrees of freedom in the images of 1 compared to other digits.\n\n.. image:: images/densmap_example_mnist.png\n    :alt: densMAP embedding of the MNIST dataset\n\n--------\n",
