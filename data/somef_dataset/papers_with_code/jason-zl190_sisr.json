To do the training, I pretrained the generator and the discriminator. \nThe repo was designed to be run in Google Cloud and makes use of GCS for logging. It contains three training tasks, which are srresnet_task, discriminator_task and srgan_task. srresnet_task trains the generator of the srgan solely, discriminator_task trains the discriminator of the srgan solely and srgan_task trains both the generator and the discriminator jointly. \n",
