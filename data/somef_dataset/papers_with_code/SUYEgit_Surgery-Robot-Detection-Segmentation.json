Information on the research group can be found in http://blog.nus.edu.sg/mpecck/. \nThe codes are based on implementation of Mask R-CNN by (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.  \nThe repository includes: \n* Source code of Mask R-CNN built on FPN and ResNet101. \n",
