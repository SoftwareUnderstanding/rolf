The task is to train a neural network which predicts the roofs of the house based on the training sets. \nTo solve this task, a U-Net architecture was chosen. The architecture was shown in Figure 1. Since very few training images exist, data augmentation was used. For this, the image was randomly flipped horizontally and vertically and randomly rotated at an angle of one degree. As loss-function tree different loss functions, the dice-loss and pixelwise-softmax and the softmax of tensorflow, are used and compared. \nThe results are produced under the following conditions: \n",
