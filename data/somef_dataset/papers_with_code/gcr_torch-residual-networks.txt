============================================

This is a Torch implementation of ["Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition",Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) the winners of the 2015 ILSVRC and COCO challenges.

**What's working:** CIFAR converges, as per the paper.

**What's not working yet:** Imagenet. I also have only implemented Option
(A) for the residual network bottleneck strategy.

Changes
-------
- 2016-02-01: Added others' preliminary results on ImageNet for the architecture. (I haven't found time to train ImageNet yet)
- 2016-01-21: Completed the 'alternate solver' experiments on deep networks. These ones take quite a long time.
- 2016-01-19:
  - **New results**: Re-ran the 'alternate building block' results on deeper networks. They have more of an effect.
  - **Added a table of contents** to avoid getting lost.
  - **Added experimental artifacts** (log of training loss and test error, the saved model, the any patches used on the source code, etc) for two of the more interesting experiments, for curious folks who want to reproduce our results. (These artifacts are hereby released under the zlib license.)
- 2016-01-15:
  - **New CIFAR results**: I re-ran all the CIFAR experiments and
  updated the results. There were a few bugs: we were only testing on
  the first 2,000 images in the training set, and they were sampled
  with replacement. These new results are much more stable over time.
- 2016-01-12: Release results of CIFAR experiments.

How to use
----------
- You need at least CUDA 7.0 and CuDNN v4.
- Install Torch.
- Install the Torch CUDNN V4 library: `git clone https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch; cd cudnn; git co R4; luarocks make` This will give you `cudnn.SpatialBatchNormalization`, which helps save quite a lot of memory.
- Install nninit: `luarocks install nninit`.
- Download
  [CIFAR 10](http://torch7.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data/cifar-10-torch.tar.gz).
  Use `--dataRoot <cifar>` to specify the location of the extracted CIFAR 10 folder.
- Run `train-cifar.lua`.

CIFAR: Effect of model size
---------------------------

For this test, our goal is to reproduce Figure 6 from the original paper:

![figure 6 from original paper](https://i.imgur.com/q3lcHic.png)

We train our model for 200 epochs (this is about 7.8e4 of their
iterations on the above graph). Like their paper, we start at a
learning rate of 0.1 and reduce it to 0.01 at 80 epochs and then to
0.01 at 160 epochs.

We can reproduce the results from the paper to typically within 0.5%.
In all cases except for the 32-layer network, we achieve very slightly
improved performance, though this may just be noise.

¹: For this run, we started from a learning rate of 0.001 until the
first 400 iterations. We then raised the learning rate to 0.1 and
trained as usual. This is consistent with the actual paper's results.

²: Note that the paper reports the best run from five runs, as well as
the mean. I consider the mean to be a valid test protocol, but I don't
like reporting the 'best' score because this is effectively training
on the test set. (This method of reporting effectively introduces an
extra parameter into the model--which model to use from the
ensemble--and this parameter is fitted to the test set)

CIFAR: Effect of model architecture
-----------------------------------

This experiment explores the effect of different NN architectures that
alter the "Building Block" model inside the residual network.

The original paper used a "Building Block" similar to the "Reference"
model on the left part of the figure below, with the standard
convolution layer, batch normalization, and ReLU, followed by another
convolution layer and batch normalization. The only interesting piece
of this architecture is that they move the ReLU after the addition.

We investigated two alternate strategies.

![Three different alternate CIFAR architectures](https://i.imgur.com/uRMBOaS.png)

- **Alternate 1: Move batch normalization after the addition.**
  (Middle) The reasoning behind this choice is to test whether
  normalizing the first term of the addition is desirable. It grew out
  of the mistaken belief that batch normalization always normalizes to
  have zero mean and unit variance. If this were true, building an
  identity building block would be impossible because the input to the
  addition always has unit variance. However, this is not true. BN
  layers have additional learnable scale and bias parameters, so the
  input to the batch normalization layer is not forced to have unit
  variance.

- **Alternate 2: Remove the second ReLU.** The idea behind this was
  noticing that in the reference architecture, the input cannot
  proceed to the output without being modified by a ReLU. This makes
  identity connections *technically* impossible because negative
  numbers would always be clipped as they passed through the skip
  layers of the network. To avoid this, we could either move the ReLU
  before the addition or remove it completely. However, it is not
  correct to move the ReLU before the addition: such an architecture
  would ensure that the output would never decrease because the first
  addition term could never be negative. The other option is to simply
  remove the ReLU completely, sacrificing the nonlinear property of
  this layer. It is unclear which approach is better.

To test these strategies, we repeat the above protocol using the
smallest (20-layer) residual network model.

(Note: The other experiments all use the leftmost "Reference" model.)

![Training loss](http://i.imgur.com/qDDLZLQ.png)

![Testing error](http://i.imgur.com/fTY6TL5.png)

| Architecture                        | Test error |
|-----------------------------------|----------|
| ReLU, BN before add (ORIG PAPER reimplementation)    | 0.0829 |
| No ReLU, BN before add              | 0.0862 |
| ReLU, BN after add                  | 0.0834 |
| No ReLU, BN after add               | 0.0823 |

All methods achieve accuracies within about 0.5% of each other.
Removing ReLU and moving the batch normalization after the addition
seems to make a small improvement on CIFAR, but there is too much
noise in the test error curve to reliably tell a difference.

CIFAR: Effect of model architecture on deep networks
----------------------------------------------------

The above experiments on the 20-layer networks do not reveal any
interesting differences. However, these differences become more
pronounced when evaluated on very deep networks. We retry the above
experiments on 110-layer (Nsize=19) networks.

![Training loss](http://i.imgur.com/RANDrXl.png)

![Testing error](http://i.imgur.com/sldN4cK.png)

Results:

- For deep networks, **it's best to put the batch normalization before
  the addition part of each building block layer**. This effectively
  removes most of the batch normalization operations from the input
  skip paths. If a batch normalization comes after each building
  block, then there exists a path from the input straight to the
  output that passes through several batch normalizations in a row.
  This could be problematic because each BN is not idempotent (the
  effects of several BN layers accumulate).

- Removing the ReLU layer at the end of each building block appears to
  give a small improvement (~0.6%)

ImageNet: Effect of model architecture (preliminary)
----------------------------------------------------
[@ducha-aiki is performing preliminary experiments on imagenet.](https://github.com/gcr/torch-residual-networks/issues/5)
For ordinary CaffeNet networks, @ducha-aiki found that putting batch
normalization after the ReLU layer may provide a small benefit
compared to putting it before.

> Second, results on CIFAR-10 often contradicts results on ImageNet. I.e., leaky ReLU > ReLU on CIFAR, but worse on ImageNet.

CIFAR: Alternate training strategies (RMSPROP, Adagrad, Adadelta)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Can we improve on the basic SGD update rule with Nesterov momentum?
This experiment aims to find out. Common wisdom suggests that
alternate update rules may converge faster, at least initially, but
they do not outperform well-tuned SGD in the long run.

![Training loss curve](http://i.imgur.com/0ZxQZ7k.png)

![Testing error curve](http://i.imgur.com/oLzwLDo.png)

In our experiments, vanilla SGD with Nesterov momentum and a learning
rate of 0.1 eventually reaches the lowest test error. Interestingly,
RMSPROP with learning rate 1e-2 achieves a lower training loss, but
overfits.

| Strategy                                      | Test error |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Original paper: SGD + Nesterov momentum, 1e-1 | 0.0829     |
| RMSprop, learrning rate = 1e-4                | 0.1677     |
| RMSprop, 1e-3                                 | 0.1055     |
| RMSprop, 1e-2                                 | 0.0945     |
| Adadelta¹, rho = 0.3                          | 0.1093     |
| Adagrad, 1e-3                                 | 0.3536     |
| Adagrad, 1e-2                                 | 0.1603     |
| Adagrad, 1e-1                                 | 0.1255     |

¹: Adadelta does not use a learning rate, so we did not use the same
learning rate policy as in the paper. We just let it run until
convergence.

See
[Andrej Karpathy's CS231N notes](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#update)
for more details on each of these learning strategies.

CIFAR: Alternate training strategies on deep networks
-----------------------------------------------------

Deeper networks are more prone to overfitting. Unlike the earlier
experiments, all of these models (except Adagrad with a learning rate
of 1e-3) achieve a loss under 0.1, but test error varies quite wildly.
Once again, using vanilla SGD with Nesterov momentum achieves the
lowest error.

| Nsize=18, Adagrad, 1e-1                   | 0.1145 |

Effect of batch norm momentum
-----------------------------

For our experiments, we use batch normalization using an exponential
running mean and standard deviation with a momentum of 0.1, meaning
that the running mean and std changes by 10% of its value at each
batch. A value of 1.0 would cause the batch normalization layer to
calculate the mean and standard deviation across only the current
batch, and a value of 0 would cause the batch normalization layer to
stop accumulating changes in the running mean and standard deviation.

The strictest interpretation of the original batch normalization paper
is to calculate the mean and standard deviation across the entire
training set at every update. This takes too long in practice, so the
exponential average is usually used instead.

We attempt to see whether batch normalization momentum affects
anything. We try different values away from the default, along with a
"dynamic" update strategy that sets the momentum to 1 / (1+n), where n
is the number of batches seen so far (N resets to 0 at every epoch).
At the end of training for a certain epoch, this means the batch
normalization's running mean and standard deviation is effectively
calculated over the entire training set.

None of these effects appear to make a significant difference.
