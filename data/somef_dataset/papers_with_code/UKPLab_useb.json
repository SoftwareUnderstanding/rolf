TSDAE is also integrated into it.\nimport torch\n\nsbert = SentenceTransformer('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens')  #: Build an SBERT model\n\n#: The only thing needed for the evaluation: a function mapping a list of sentences into a batch of vectors (torch.Tensor)\n@torch.no_grad()\ndef semb_fn(sentences) -> torch.Tensor:\n    return torch.Tensor(sbert.encode(sentences, show_progress_bar=False))\n\nresults, results_main_metric = run(\n    semb_fn_askubuntu=semb_fn, \n    semb_fn_cqadupstack=semb_fn,  \n    semb_fn_twitterpara=semb_fn, \n    semb_fn_scidocs=semb_fn,\n    eval_type='test',\n    data_eval_path='data-eval'  #: This should be the path to the folder of data-eval\n)\n\nassert round(results_main_metric['avg'], 1) == 47.6\n```\nIt is also supported to evaluate on a single dataset (please see [useb/examples/eval_sbert_askubuntu.py](useb/examples/eval_sbert_askubuntu.py)):\n```bash\npython -m useb.examples.eval_sbert_askubuntu\n```\n\n",
