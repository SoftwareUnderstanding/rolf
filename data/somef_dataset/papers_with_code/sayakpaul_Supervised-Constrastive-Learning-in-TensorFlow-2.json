      "excerpt": "The authors used AutoAugment in the paper. However, we used simple augmnetation operations which worked for the datasets we tried. Note that, there's no augmentation for the Pets dataset as we got pretty good results on that one even without any data augmentation. \nLARS optimizer was used in the paper, however we used Adam. We have also shown the effect of different optimizers like SGD and RMSProp along with learning rate schedules. \nThe above plots are from the experiments conducted on the Pets dataset. More results from the other two datasets have been discussed in the above-mentioned report and can be found here: https://app.wandb.ai/authors/scl. \nAt the time of performing the experiments, we used TensorFlow 2.2. We specifically did not denote the versions of the other libraries. All of our experiments were performed on Google Colab. \n",
