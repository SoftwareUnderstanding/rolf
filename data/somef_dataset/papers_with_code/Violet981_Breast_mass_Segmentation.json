Little changes in the main.py file. \n102 pairs of mammography and mask images were obtained from INbreast dataset. Since it is not enough, I used Keras ImageDataGenerator to get 20052 images to train. Something needed to be noticed: the code in the main.py requires the number of training images minus 4 to be the multiple of batch number(which is 8 in the default setting). For example, (20052 - 4) % 8 = 0. You can find it in line 232. \nUsing python main.py --mode=evaluate to have a test. The output of test results are stored in /sample/evaluate.  \n",
