We also need a sparse SfM point clouds and a list of image pairs obtained with image retrieval. You can easily generate them using our toolbox [hloc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization/).\n3. Taking the `pixloc/run_Aachen.py` as a template, we can copy the file structure of the *Aachen* dataset and/or adjust the variable `default_paths`, which stores local subpaths from `DATA_PATH` and `LOC_PATH` (defined in [`pixloc/settings.py`](pixloc/settings.py)).\n\n</details>\n\n",
