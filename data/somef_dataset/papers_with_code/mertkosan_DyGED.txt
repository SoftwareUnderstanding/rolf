# Event Detection on Dynamic Graphs

This is a PyTorch implementation of DyGED (Dynamic Graph Event Detection) that is proposed 
event detection architecture in our paper:

Mert Kosan, et.al. [Event Detection on Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12148), 2021.

### Get Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### TODO

* Twitter Weather dataset trained model and test data.
* How to run the model instructions.
