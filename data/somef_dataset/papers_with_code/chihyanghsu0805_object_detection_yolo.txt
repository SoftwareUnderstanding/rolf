This repository re-implements YOLOv3 objection detection.

# You Only Look Once
YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.\
https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ \
It obsoletes sliding window approaches by finding the bounding box in a regression problem.

Currently, there are three versions. \
YOLOv3: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf \
YOLO9000: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf \
YOLO: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf
