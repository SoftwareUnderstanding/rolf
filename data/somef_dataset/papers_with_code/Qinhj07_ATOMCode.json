      "excerpt": "In short, Precise RoI Pooling is an integration-based (bilinear interpolation) average pooling method for RoI Pooling. It avoids any quantization and has a continuous gradient on bounding box coordinates. It is: \ndifferent from the original RoI Pooling proposed in Fast R-CNN. PrRoI Pooling uses average pooling instead of max pooling for each bin and has a continuous gradient on bounding box coordinates. That is, one can take the derivatives of some loss function w.r.t the coordinates of each RoI and optimize the RoI coordinates. \ndifferent from the RoI Align proposed in Mask R-CNN. PrRoI Pooling uses a full integration-based average pooling instead of sampling a constant number of points. This makes the gradient w.r.t. the coordinates continuous. \nFor a better illustration, we illustrate RoI Pooling, RoI Align and PrRoI Pooing in the following figure. More details including the gradient computation can be found in our paper. \n",

It requires PyTorch 0.4 and only supports CUDA (CPU mode is not implemented).\nTo use the PrRoI Pooling module, first goto `pytorch/prroi_pool` and execute `./travis.sh` to compile the essential components (you may need `nvcc` for this step). To use the module in your code, simply do:\n\n```\nfrom prroi_pool import PrRoIPool2D\n\navg_pool = PrRoIPool2D(window_height, window_width, spatial_scale)\nroi_features = avg_pool(features, rois)\n\n#: for those who want to use the \"functional\"\n\nfrom prroi_pool.functional import prroi_pool2d\nroi_features = prroi_pool2d(features, rois, window_height, window_width, spatial_scale)\n```\n\nHere,\n\n- RoI is an `m * 5` float tensor of format `(batch_index, x0, y0, x1, y1)`, following the convention in the original Caffe implementation of RoI Pooling, although in some frameworks the batch indices are provided by an integer tensor.\n- `spatial_scale` is multiplied to the RoIs. For example, if your feature maps are down-sampled by a factor of 16 (w.r.t. the input image), you should use a spatial scale of `1/16`.\n- The coordinates for RoI follows the [L, R) convension. That is, `(0, 0, 4, 4)` denotes a box of size `4x4`.\n",
