      "excerpt": "Variational feature learning (VFL) is employed to derive highly discriminating representations for vehicle images, which helps to improve the performance of vehicle re-identificaton. VFL learns Gaussian distribution from CNN-based features. \nwe trained the model with KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence. Two fully connected layers are used to predict the means \u00b5 and the standard deviation \u03c3 of a Gaussian distribution N (\u00b5, \u03c3) . The outputs of this stage ensure the representation to diverse sufficiently. Besides, the outputs \u00b5 is well normalized. Along with KL divergence, Softmax classifier on top of the means \u00b5 layer is used to learn this network \nHere we show the feature distrubution of the 10 classes of MNIST dataset. Left animation shows the feature distribution of testing set of MNIST when the model is trained with the only Softmax classifier, Second animation shows the feature distribution of the same dataset generated by unsupervised variational autoencoder, whereas the third shows the feature distribution of the proposed VFL model in this work. This animation has been generated while the model was being trained, by plotting the feature distribution after each epoch of total 50 epochs when batch size=100. \n",
