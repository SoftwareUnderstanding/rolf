      "excerpt": "**Objective:** Generate images of oceans and mountains\n**Dataset:** Oceans (~600 images), mountains (~700 images); clean data (size: 64x64)\n**Training:** 350 epochs\n\nMany GANs projects focus on faces. However, due to intricate facial details including shapes (face, eyes, nose, lips, glasses, ...), texture (hair, skin, ...), nuances of colors (hair, skin, ...) generating high quality images of faces can take weeks of training. [3] The prerequisite is access to a large database.\n\nBy reducing the complexity of shapes, texture and colors we can achieve good results in less time with less data.\n\nWhy oceans and mountains?\nBoth have distinct features. Oceans show few difficulties in terms of shapes and texture and have one nuanced base color. Mountains are more detailed in terms of shapes and texture, however the scope of mountain landscapes allows many different variations and thus, would still be recognized as mountains.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/suzana-ilic/pytorch_DCGANs/blob/master/dcgans.gif\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., ... & Bengio, Y.
