      "excerpt": "This is repository is created as a part of final project for Fundamentals of Machine Learning (EEL5840) under Prof Alina Zare in University of Florida for the Master's in Computer Science program. <b>An implentation of Deep convolutional neural network  inspired by the famous \"Lenet\"(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf) Architecture with Pytorch to recognize Handwritten Characters.</b> \nThe Dataset is custom handwritten charecters provided by Prof Alina Zare created by her students of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Florida. \nThe \u201ceasy\u201d test set is composed of hand-written \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 characters. The  code should produce the labels \u20191\u2019 for \u2019a\u2019 and \u20192\u2019 for \u2019b\u2019 \nThe goal is to train the system to distinguish between handwritten characters. The \u201chard\u201d data set consists of the following characters: \u2019a\u2019, \u2019b\u2019,\u2019c\u2019,\u2019d\u2019,\u2019h\u2019, \u2019i\u2019, \u2019j\u2019 and \u2019k\u2019 and \u2019unknown\u2019. There will be test data points from classes that do not appear in the training data. So, the system have come up with a way to identify when a test point class is \u201cunknown\u201d or what not in the training data. The label you should return for this case is -1. \n",
