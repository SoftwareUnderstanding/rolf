      "excerpt": "The EgoHands Dataset, curated by Indiana University, came with a set of labelled annotations that were used to generate TFRecords files, which were required to train the SSD MobileNet. The trained frozen inference graph was then utilized in conjunction with a multithreading approach implemented in OpenCV to detect when a hand was present in a user's webcam input, along with its location on the screen. In the future, this may be implemented to allow the user to interact with their computer's interface, performing actions such as clicking, dragging and dropping, and even playing simple games. \n",
