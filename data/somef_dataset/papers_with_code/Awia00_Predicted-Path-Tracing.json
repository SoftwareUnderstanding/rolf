      "excerpt": "The goal of this project is to make a supervised machine learning model which can predict pixel values of a none-complete path tracing image. \nPath tracing can generate stunning renders with physically accurate properties. Unfortunately the complexity of path tracing makes it near impossible to achieve real time performance. With the increasing focus on machine learning and the new push towards ray tracing graphics with the RTX line of Nvidia GPUS, I hope to combine these two fields, to make a POC of predicting renders. \n",
