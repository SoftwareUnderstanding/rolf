      "excerpt": "This is a notebook for experimenting for a pet project. The idea is to fine-tune an NLP model(e.x. AlBERT) to predict intention from user's requests for voice asistant like Alexa or Siri. \nI'm going to use a pretrained model from tensorflow_hub as a backbone for this experiment, add several layers on top of it and fine-tune the model. \nAfter that, the structured repository with all scripts for getting the data, preprocessing, setting up a model, training and inferencing will be prepared. \nEach cell of this particular notebook can be treated as a separate python file for now(As I mentioned, I'll convert it into the full-featured project later.) \n",
