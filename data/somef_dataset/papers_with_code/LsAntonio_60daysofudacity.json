Meaning the differential data come more close to the real result of the query on the real data. When repeating this experiment multiples times I observed the same results.

However, increasing the entries, will also increase the gap between the queries. This is also true for the random sum and logarithm sum queries.

Of course, this classifiers must belong to the same category we want to obtain the labels.

However, in order to assure the privacy component, we will add some degree of epsilon (privacy leak) over the generation of the labels. This will be used as part of a Laplacian noise mechanism (we can use Gaussian too). In this way, we are obtaining the labels for our local data set without compromising the privacy of the individuals in the external data sets.

Next, it averages the gradients and add noise. Here, the noise is one of the mechanism to assure privacy. Finally it moves the gradients in the opposite direction of the average gradients (which have some degree of noise).

However, even with this mechanism, there are still ways in which we can guess the real values from the external data sets using the classifiers parameter\u2019s\u201d. Indeed, as we have seen in past lessons, it is totally possible to use some queries over the data sets to break privacy. In this case, the same can be applied to the classifiers (algorithms). In particular, if we use neural networks, we can use the raw gradients to obtain such information. Hopefully, we can add a noise degree over the label generation process. To be more precisely, this noise will represent the value of privacy we want to keep. As seen in the literature, this value correspond to the epsilon parameter. Now, regarding the noise, we can use different functions to generate it. However, as discussed in class, the more efficient, in terms of computationally cost and implementation is the Laplacian noise. Therefore we will apply the Laplacian noise, also, we set the value to 0.1. \n",

In contrast, more simple models, are easier to explain. Therefore there is a trade-off between complexity and explanation.

Next, I compared the accuracy using a single run (training only once) versus an average run (repeating the training process 20 times).

To be more concretely, each time I changed the label values, the PATE results remained the same. This was maintained, independent of the type of variations to the generated labels. At first, I suspected that the problem could reside in the data set size. However, the Lessons seemed to contradict this. In fact, the results from the Lesson, shown how with tiny variations in the labels, the PATE results change. This behavior was present, independently of the data size. Finally, I was able to understand why the PATE results did not change when the labels changed. This behavior was not related with the data size, but with the teachers number. It seems that, using a small number of teachers (e.g. ten) had a small impact over the generated labels. Thus, the PATE results did not have a significative change. On the contrary, if we use a large teacher number (e.g. 100), this will mainly affect the generated labels, leading to reflect the changes in the PATE results, when the labels changes. \n",

Federated Learning is a technique, which allow us to train a model across different users, without compromising their privacy. In this project, I implemented federated learning using a set of workers. In the context of DP, the workers represent the remote users. This users will have local data, in which we would like to train on. However, even if we send a copy of the main model to the users, it is still possible to see their data using a leak. This leak, involve the use of the raw gradients. These gradients contain the user data. Therefore, in order to add an extra security layer, we can apply an aggregator. This aggregator will compute the averaged from the gradients. Then, in the server we will receive the averaged gradients. This ensures that, we are not seeking at the actual gradients. In the figure, we can see how the server gets the averaged gradients, while each worker compute their own gradient. Finally, I participated in a meeting with the sg_latin group. We discussed diverse topics involving Deep Learning applications, and how we can implement private techniques. In particular, we define a collaborative project involving real user data. \n",

This mechanism guarantees that no other individuals know what the adding input was. This is also applied to the users using this encryption. In this context, we can implement diverse operations. For example, we can encrypt the values and add a multiplication, division, etc. However, we can perform these operations directly into the encrypted values. Then, we can decrypt the values and get the result from the operation. This means, we can use this mechanism not only to protect the data, but also to operate over it.

Also I learn about a method called: Precision Encoding. This method allow us to encrypt our data using an encoding and decoding mechanism. This process, will first convert the data into an encoded representation. This representation have a Q parameter, which indicates the total size of the operations. Where, the size of any operation must not be grater than Q. Otherwise, we will have an overflow problem. After the data is encoded, a decoded operation can be applied to get the original results. Moreover, we can perform several operation in the encoding form, without affecting the real data. Finally, I participated in the sg_lating meeting.

Concretely, we discussed: trusted aggregators, additive sharing, encoded and decoded encryption, encrypted operations and fixed precision in PySyft. These techniques will be combined into Federated Learning. For example, we can safely aggregate the gradients using a secure third party (trusted aggregators). Also, since we are dealing with the user\u2019s gradients, we can encrypt these values using additive sharing among different workers. This, will ensure that the data remains encrypted from each worker. To sum up, using PySyft we can implement these mechanism into Federated Learning across multiple workers. Also, I learn about Reinforcement learning, which allow us to create programs, which can learn by themselves. In the context of deep learning, these programs are represented by deep neural networks. These networks, will learn to represent knowledge to interact with an environment. This environment can be virtual or physical. Then, the reinforcement model will learn to perform a task using its actions to interact with the environment. The objective, is to obtain the maximum reward, which is a function defined beforehand. Then after a number of iterations, the model will correctly learn the task. These models can be applied to a wide variety of domains, such as: finance, process, etc. \n",

      "excerpt": "Today, I learned about encrypted deep learning. Encrypted deep learning allow us to encrypt our models using encryption techniques. These techniques allow us to perform different arithmetic operations over encoded values. Where, the values represent the parameters of the model. The encryption is composed by diverse set of arithmetic operations, which apply a field representation. The field will contain a set of parameters and operations, therefore, it will have a size. If we use a ten field size, each number and operation will be contained inside this field. This means, that, in order to use encrypted operations, the parameters and results must not be greater than the field. Otherwise, we will generate an overflow. An overflow will damage our representations, thus, the computation values will be numerically wrong. Also, since these encryption involve a decryption process, which can be computationally expensive, we can, in some settings, only encrypt one portion of the data. This will translate in a gain speed for computations, increasing the performance of the operations. As part of the study group, today I have an interesting meeting with the sg_latin group. Where, we discussed diverse topics related to project implementations. Finally, I completed the final project from Lesson 8, where I implemented Federated Learning using encryption and trusted aggregation. I used the iris data set, for which I apply an initial data exploration as seen in the figure. Also, I shown the accuracy from the remote models against the main model. The results indicate that the main model averaged the encrypted gradients efficiently. Thus, the obtained accuracy was 98.67%. \n",

Meaning, we can secure both, the data used to train the models, which contain sensitive information, and the model itself. There are different ways in which we can achieve this. One of them, is additive secret sharing encryption. This technique, will encode the data among different users. This idea is not only applied to the server-user relationship, but between users as well. Thus, protecting user data and ensuring that the users only access to their own data. The model can be also encrypted using this technique. In this context, is important to note that, the model needs to be also encrypted since it contains private information in the form of raw gradients. The gradients represent the learning data, therefore it is important to encrypt them too. But, this alone is not enough, now, we need a secure framework to train and deploy the model. Hopefully, we can rely in the PySyft framework, which implement these techniques to secure train the model. This can be also extended to the Federated Learning approach. Even more, we can combine different techniques to add more privacy. \n",

Moreover I have been exposed to an emergent field. I have to say thanks to Udacity, Facebook and Prof. Andrew Trask for elaborate such amazing course. As a side note, I want to highlight the words from  Prof. Andrew Trask, regarding, when to apply these techniques. It is important to note, how these techniques can be adapted according with the scenario. Also, trust remains as an key component in the whole privacy pipeline. I think, that, as practitioners, we must do all what is in our hands to ensure these trust with the person\u2019s data. Thus, we can help researchers to share their data sets. Which will allow many discoveries. I think, this is strongly true in the health field, where we cannot risk the user\u2019s privacy to be leak. Finally, I completed the project from this Lesson, where we implemented an encrypted database using an encryption mechanism. This mechanism implement an encoded and decoded process. This allowed us to represent the data (encoded) and to respond with the real value (decoded) when a query was perform. To encode the data, we apply two encoded process, one for the keys and the other for the values. In the keys, we apply one-hot representation. This will turn on a single value in the matrix, which represent the keys. Also, the values are encoded using a tensor representation, where each value correspond to a data dictionary representation. Finally, we used syft to add an encryption layer to our encoder-decoder representation. This allowed us to send the data to diverse workers, where each worker have their data encrypted. Then, we can query over the real values of the data base without revealing the values in the process. See the notebook for this day for more details. \n",

Among the different topics, we talk about how to represent music. In particular we explored the histogram representation of music, where we can represent a sound into an image. Also, we talk about classification in music, where different architectures can be used. Next, we discussed the process of music creation.

Moreover, I have learned about an important aspect of Deep Learning: privacy. Privacy is an important area presented in different aspects of science and technology. In the particular case of Deep Learning, as we continue to develop more complex models, it is also important to consider the privacy component of such models. For this, we can use different frameworks, which maintain privacy using deep learning. Among these techniques, we have: Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Encrypted Federated Learning. Each technique can be used alone or combined to guarantee privacy. We can combine Pytorch alongside an excellent library, which implement these technique and many others called: PySyft. Using PySyft we can add these techniques into our machine learning pipeline. Also, I have completed my Keystone Project: Privacy Techniques in Deep Learning. Finally I would like to express my gratitude towards: <b>Udacity, Facebook and Prof. Andrew Trask</b> for developing the <b>Secure and Private AI Challenge</b> from which I have learned so much. \n",
