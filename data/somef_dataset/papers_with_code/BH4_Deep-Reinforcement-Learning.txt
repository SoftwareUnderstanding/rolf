# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
My attempt to create a single AI that can play several games.

Inspired entirely by this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602 about playing Atari games with the technique named Deep Q Learning.
I also started my code by studying and directly editing the project at https://gist.github.com/EderSantana/c7222daa328f0e885093.

My goal is to continue to make more games that that can be played by the AI with as much modification as needed to the AI until I better understand how changing the neural network structure and the structure of the game that is being played affects the learning of the AI. The next step would be to recreate the neural network in the original paper more exactly and test it on the games I have already created.
