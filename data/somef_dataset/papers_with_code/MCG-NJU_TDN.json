Extract frames from videos(you can use ffmpeg to get frames from video)      \n    2. Generate annotations needed for dataloader (\"<path_to_frames> <frames_num> <video_class>\" in annotations) The annotation usually includes train.txt and val.txt. The format of *.txt file is like:\n        ```\n        dataset_root/frames/video_1 num_frames label_1\n        dataset_root/frames/video_2 num_frames label_2\n        dataset_root/frames/video_3 num_frames label_3\n        ...\n        dataset_root/frames/video_N num_frames label_N\n        ```\n    3. Add the information to `ops/dataset_configs.py`.\n\n- The processing of **Kinetics400** can be summarized into 3 steps:\n    1. We preprocess our data by resizing the short edge of video to 320px. You can refer to [MMAction2 Data Benchmark](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2) for [TSN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/configs/recognition/tsn#kinetics-400-data-benchmark-8-gpus-resnet50-imagenet-pretrain-3-segments) and [SlowOnly](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/configs/recognition/slowonly#kinetics-400-data-benchmark).\n    2.
