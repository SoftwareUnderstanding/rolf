      "excerpt": "Most users do not need the OpenPose C++/Python API, but can simply use the OpenPose Demo:\n\n- **OpenPose Demo**: To easily process images/video/webcam and display/save the results. See [doc/demo_overview.md](doc/demo_overview.md). E.g., run OpenPose in a video with:\n```\n#: Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\\media\\video.avi\n```\n\n- **Calibration toolbox**: To easily calibrate your cameras for 3-D OpenPose or any other stereo vision task. See [doc/modules/calibration_module.md](doc/modules/calibration_module.md).\n\n- **OpenPose C++ API**: If you want to read a specific input, and/or add your custom post-processing function, and/or implement your own display/saving, check the C++ API tutorial on [examples/tutorial_api_cpp/](examples/tutorial_api_cpp/) and [doc/library_introduction.md](doc/library_introduction.md). You can create your custom code on [examples/user_code/](examples/user_code/) and quickly compile it with CMake when compiling the whole OpenPose project. Quickly **add your custom code**: See [examples/user_code/README.md](examples/user_code/README.md) for further details.\n\n- **OpenPose Python API**: Analogously to the C++ API, find the tutorial for the Python API on [examples/tutorial_api_python/](examples/tutorial_api_python/).\n\n- **Adding an extra module**: Check [doc/library_add_new_module.md](./doc/library_add_new_module.md).\n\n- **Standalone face or hand detector**:\n    - **Face** keypoint detection **without body** keypoint detection: If you want to speed it up (but also reduce amount of detected faces), check the OpenCV-face-detector approach in [doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md](doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md).\n    - **Use your own face/hand detector**: You can use the hand and/or face keypoint detectors with your own face or hand detectors, rather than using the body detector. E.g., useful for camera views at which the hands are visible but not the body (OpenPose detector would fail). See [doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md](doc/standalone_face_or_hand_keypoint_detector.md).\n\n\n\n",
