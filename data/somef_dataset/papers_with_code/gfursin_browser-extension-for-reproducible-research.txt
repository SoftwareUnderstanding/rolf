## Notes

This browser extension helps you to annotate web pages with related research papers, 
code, reproducible results, scoreboards, portable workflows and reusable artifacts
for AI, ML, Systems and other emerging technologies. 

The goal is to help researchers and practitioners find, test, reproduce
and adopt novel techniques presented on web pages. You can also add your
own links with relevant information for a given web page as well as rank
the relevance of existing ones.

This extension uses our [Collective Knowledge aggregator and search engine](https://cKnowledge.io).
We regularly index 1M+ URLs from Arxiv, GitHub, GitLab, paperswithcode, Zenodo, 
ACM DL, and continue adding new research links weekly.

The red neuron indicates that a given web page is not annotated.
The blue neuron indicates that there is shared knowledge for this web page.

## Test
Please, navigate to the [MobileNets ArXiv paper]( https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861 ),
[MLPerf inference ArXiv paper]( https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02549v2 ) 
and [MLPerf inference benchmark GitHub]( https://github.com/mlcommons/inference )
to test this extension. You click on the blue neuron of this extension
to see related code, artifacts and results.
