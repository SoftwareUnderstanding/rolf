      "excerpt": "In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), text similarity is a hot spot. It is particularly important to measure the similarity between sentences or phrases in some NLP subareas such as dialog system and information retrieval. Quora Question Pairs is a Kaggle competition, which challenges participants to tackle the problem of identifying duplicate questions. This paper works on the sentence similarity problem and deals with the task of duplicate question pairs identification.\n\nIn all (so far as for the ML course project), we proposes three models to tackle the duplicate question pairs identification problem on the Quora Question Pairs dataset. **Model 1** uses traditional machine learning classifiers like SGD Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier with statistical, NLP and vector features extracted from ques- tion text for classification. **Model 2** uses a Siamese BiLSTM based neural network structure combined with NLP features for classification. **Model 3** fine-tunes BERT pre-trained model and uses a simple BiLSTM based neural network structure after BERT to adapt features from BERT for classification. All models achive a relatively good results.\n\n\n\n",

Model 2 also uses some of features (tm_feature.csv and nlp_feature.csv) from Model 1's feature engineering process. You need to run ipynb notebooks in the correct order to reproduce all my results. \nAnd also, some of my ipynb like: \nin the feature_engineering_train.ipynb i used en_core_web_md but in the modeling.ipynb i changed it to en_core_web_sm that i obtained from previous experiment (this is because my laptop runs out of memory if using the md version, so i give it up in the modeling process, so if you want to reproduce, use the correct version of packages and functions) \nin the siamese_lstm_featured.ipynb, you need to change to Bidirectional to get the results that i've get in the report/ppt/md_comments.  \n",
