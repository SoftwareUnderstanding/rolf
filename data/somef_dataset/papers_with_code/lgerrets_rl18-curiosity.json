      "excerpt": "Environments where the extrinsic rewards are sparsely observed are harder to explore and to learn for RL agents since they may require more episodes to determine which sequences of actions lead to high rewards. Recently, it has been argued that adding intrinsic rewards (for instance through Random Network Distillation) can help to drive the exploration efficiently in Atari games [1][2][3] and can be simply implemented along with Proximal Policy Optimization [4]. As opposed to extrinsic rewards, intrinsic rewards are not necessarily constant over the episodes: such rewards can be seen as \"curiosity\" functions. Through this case study we aim at highlighting the advantages and limitations of curiosity-driven exploration.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12894.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf\n[3] https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/resources/largeScaleCuriosity2018.pdf\n[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf\n\n",
