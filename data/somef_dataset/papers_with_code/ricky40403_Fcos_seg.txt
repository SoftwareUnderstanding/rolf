# Fcos_seg


Fcos: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355


Fcos is an interesting object detection work.
It removes the anchor and the tricks for training are good for multiscale.

With no anchor computing, it may combine the semantic segmentation to produce some great works due to its time and memory efficiency.
