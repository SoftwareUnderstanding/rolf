# Dataset

The ChestX-ray14 dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with 14 disease labels. To evaluate the model, we randomly split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%) and test (20%) sets, following the work in paper. Partitioned image names and corresponding labels are placed under the directory labels
