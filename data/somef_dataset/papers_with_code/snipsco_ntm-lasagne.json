No problem!\nThere are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,\nhelping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding\nnew features and patches.\nGetting Started\n\nMake sure you have a GitHub account.\nOpen a new issue, assuming one does not already exist.\nClearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\n\nMaking Changes\n\nFork this repository.\nCreate a feature branch from where you want to base your work.\nMake commits of logical units (if needed rebase your feature branch before\n  submitting it).\nCheck for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.\nMake sure your commit messages are well formatted.\nIf your commit fixes an open issue, reference it in the commit message (f.e. #15).\nRun all the tests (if existing) to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.\n\nThese guidelines also apply when helping with documentation.\nSubmitting Changes\n\nPush your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository.\nSubmit a Pull Request.\nWait for maintainer feedback.",
