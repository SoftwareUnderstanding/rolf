## We making a recognition of potential insulting pictures

Our goal is to help users understand better 
the possible consequences of their meme post.
Especially those which can offend the feelings of religious.
With adding our bot, you can send him different pictures and it will
tell you when you have a religious meme and will warn you. 
You can add a bot to the conversation and it will watch your memes :)
