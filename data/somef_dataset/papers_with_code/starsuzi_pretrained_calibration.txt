## Overview

Posterior calibration is a measure of how aligned a model's posterior probabilities are with empirical likelihoods. For example, a perfectly calibrated model that outputs 0.8 probability on 100 samples should get 80% of the samples correct. In this work, we analyze the calibration of two pre-trained Transformers (BERT and RoBERTa) on three tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning.

For natural language inference, we use [Stanford Natural Language Inference](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) (SNLI) and [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/) (MNLI). For paraphrase detection, we use [Quora Question Pairs](https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) (QQP) and [TwitterPPDB](https://languagenet.github.io/) (TPPDB). And, for commonsense reasoning, we use [Situations with Adversarial Generations](https://rowanzellers.com/swag/) (SWAG) and [HellaSWAG](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/) (HSWAG).

To measure calibration error, we chiefly use expected calibration error (ECE), where ECE = 0 indicates perfect calibration. When used in-domain, pre-trained models ([BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)) are generally **much more calibrated** than non-pre-trained models ([DA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01933), [ESIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06038)). For example, on SWAG:

| Model   | Accuracy |  ECE |
|---------|:--------:|:----:|
| DA      |   46.80  | 5.98 |
| ESIM    |   52.09  | 7.01 |
| BERT    |   79.40  | 2.49 |
| RoBERTa |   82.45  | 1.76 |

To bring down calibration error, we experiment with two strategies. First, **temperature scaling** (TS; dividing non-normalized logits by scalar T) almost always brings ECE below 1. Below, we show in-domain results with and without temperature scaling:

| Model         | SNLI | QQP  | SWAG |
|---------------|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| RoBERTa       | 1.93 | 2.33 | 1.76 |
| RoBERTa (+TS) | 0.84 | 0.88 | 0.76 |

Second, deliberately inducing uncertainty via **label smoothing** (LS) helps calibrate posteriors out-of-domain. MLE training encourages models to be over-confident, which is typically unwarranted out-of-domain, where models should be uncertain. We show out-of-domain results with and without label smoothing:

| Model       | MNLI | TPPDB |  HSWAG |
|--------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| RoBERTa-MLE  | 3.62 |  9.55 | 11.93 |
| RoBERTa-LS   | 4.50 |  8.91 | 2.14  |

## Instructions

### Requirements

This repository has the following requirements:

- `numpy==1.18.1`
- `scikit-learn==0.22.1`
- `torch==1.2.0`
- `tqdm==4.42.1`
- `transformers==2.4.1`

Use the following instructions to set up the dependencies:

```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3.6 venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Obtaining Datasets

Because many of these tasks are either included in the GLUE benchmark or commonly used to evaluate pre-trained models, the test sets are blind. Therefore, we split the development set in half to obtain a non-blind, held-out test set. The dataset splits are shown below, and additionally, you may [download the exact train/dev/test datasets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ro3Q7019AtGYSG76KeZQSq35lBi7lU3v/view?usp=sharing) used in our experiments. Use `tar -zxf calibration_data.tar.gz` to unpack the archive, and place it in the root directory.

| Dataset |  Train  |   Dev  |  Test  |
|---------|:-------:|:------:|:------:|
| SNLI    | 549,368 |  4,922 |  4,923 |
| MNLI    | 392,702 |  4,908 |  4,907 |
| QQP     | 363,871 | 20,216 | 20,217 |
| TPPDB   |  46,667 |  5,060 |  5,060 |
| SWAG    |  73,547 | 10,004 | 10,004 |
| HSWAG   |  39,905 |  5,021 |  5,021 |

### Fine-tuning Models

Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on any dataset (SNLI, MNLI, QQP, TwitterPPDB, SWAG, HellaSWAG). Below, we show an example script for fine-tuning BERT on SNLI. To use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), set `LABEL_SMOOTHING=-1`, otherwise to use label smoothing (LS), use `0 < LABEL_SMOOTHING < 1`. Models were trained using a single NVIDIA 32GB V100 GPU, although 16GB GPUs can be also be used with smaller batch sizes.

```bash
export DEVICE=0
export MODEL="bert-base-uncased"  # options: bert-base-uncased, roberta-base
export TASK="SNLI"  # options: SNLI, MNLI, QQP, TwitterPPDB, SWAG, HellaSWAG
export LABEL_SMOOTHING=-1  # options: -1 (MLE), [0, 1]
export MAX_SEQ_LENGTH=256

if [ $MODEL = "bert-base-uncased" ]; then
    BATCH_SIZE=16
    LEARNING_RATE=2e-5
    WEIGHT_DECAY=0
fi

if [ $MODEL = "roberta-base" ]; then
    BATCH_SIZE=32
    LEARNING_RATE=1e-5
    WEIGHT_DECAY=0.1
fi
python
python3 train.py \
    --device $DEVICE \
    --model $MODEL \
    --task $TASK \
    --ckpt_path "ckpt/${TASK}_${MODEL}.pt" \
    --output_path "output/${TASK}_${MODEL}.json" \
    --train_path "calibration_data/${TASK}/train.txt" \
    --dev_path "calibration_data/${TASK}/dev.txt" \
    --test_path "calibration_data/${TASK}/test.txt" \
    --epochs 3 \
    --batch_size $BATCH_SIZE \
    --learning_rate $LEARNING_RATE \
    --weight_decay $WEIGHT_DECAY \
    --label_smoothing $LABEL_SMOOTHING \
    --max_seq_length $MAX_SEQ_LENGTH \
    --do_train \
    --do_evaluate
```

### Evaluating Calibration

We evaluate calibration using the output files dumped in the previous step (when `--do_evaluate` is enabled). Below is an example script that evaluates the calibration of RoBERTa-MLE on QQP using temperature scaling. Note that we use QQP-dev to learn the temperature scaling hyperparameter `T`, then evaluate its performance on QQP-test. 

```bash
export TRAIN_PATH="output/dev/QQP_QQP_roberta-base.json"
export TEST_PATH="output/test/QQP_QQP_roberta-base.json"

python3 calibrate.py \
	--train_path $TRAIN_PATH \
	--test_path $TEST_PATH \
	--do_train \
	--do_evaluate
```

And, here is a sample output generated by the previous command:

```
*** training ***
temperature = 1.35

*** evaluating ***
accuracy = 90.92752906257729
confidence = 90.47990015170494
temperature = 1.35
neg log likelihood = 0.21548164472197104
expected error = 1.0882433139537815
max error = 2.4872166586668243
total error = 7.413702354436335
```
