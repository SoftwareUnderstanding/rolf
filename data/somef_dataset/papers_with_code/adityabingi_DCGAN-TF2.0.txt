# DCGAN

Minimalistic tf 2.0 implementation of DCGAN with support for distributed training on multiple GPUs.

This work is aimed to generate novel face images similar to CelebA image dataset using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).

Code compatibility:
python>=3.6
Tensorflow==2.0.0

## Dataset

`python download_celebA.py 0B7EVK8r0v71pZjFTYXZWM3FlRnM CelebA.zip`

Extract CelebA.zip and the images are found in the img_align_celeba folder.

Data Processing:

All the images in the celeba dataset are of (218 ,178, 3) resolution and for this work all the images are cropped by carefully choosing the common face region (128, 128, 3) in all the images. Check data_crop in config.py

## Usage

For multi-gpu training:

`python dcgan.py --train`

To run on single GPU run the above code by replacing strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(devices) (line 185 in dcgan.py) with 
strategy=tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy(device='/GPU:0') and configure device variable by passing it with specific gpu id like "/device:GPU:0" or "/device:GPU:1" 

You can also run single GPU training with tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy also by simply setting num_gpu = 1 in config.py.

For Generating new samples:

`python dcgan.py --generate`


## Results

Following are the results after training GAN on 128x128 resolution CelebA face images for 15 epochs on 2 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs with global batch size of 32 (batch size 16 per gpu). Detailed configuration can be found in config.py
