# cv-project-2020

The project of Introduction to Computer Vision course in Innopolis University, Fall 2020.

The work based on:
    1. Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06937.pdf
    2. Pytorch implementation of the model: https://github.com/princeton-vl/pytorch_stacked_hourglass

The pipeline requires the machine with Nvidia GPU in order to perform training (the best result with 2xGPU setup)
