# AbstractArtGenerator
A Machine Learning project to generate Watercolor art pieces. This is still a work in progress, however the current version works. The plans are to make one universal version in which you can choose size of images produced and make the saving and loading of the model much cleaner.

This project was level 5 of the Hello World course I am taking. The goal of this unit was to undertake an entire machine learning project on your own. Research how to do it, choose your own libraries and use the documentation and such to build one out, test and bug fix it. The final portion is doing a code review, which has already been completed, and fixing to present this project to a group of instructors, peers, and other developers.

This project was based on the paper by Alec Ruford, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala.
