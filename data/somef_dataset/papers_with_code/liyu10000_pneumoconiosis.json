      "excerpt": "Since the models described in source paper and paper by NG's group are not available, I did some search and located some useful dataset analyze and model exploration efforts made by people on Kaggle and Github. \n - Kevin Mader on Kaggle. He has presented very good dataset analysis, data preprocessings and model training.  \n - Caleb P on Kaggle. Tried to MobileNet and InceptionResNetV2 as base model and showed sample data training and result presenting. \n - arnoweng on GitHub. It is a pytorch reimplementation of CheXNet, that presented by NG paper. It only has prediction code, not training code. \n - brucechou1983 on GitHub. It is a keras reimplementation of CheXNet. Contains full codes. \ncnn1, cnn2: Used the data preprocessing and model building method described by Kevin Mader. \ncnn3: Used data preprocessing method by Kevin Mader and model building method by Caleb P. \ncnn4: Used data preprocessing method by Kevin Mader and model building method by brucechou1983. Updated image proprocessing method: center cropping, 0-1 normalization, mean/std normalization. Train on 2 classes. \ncnn5: Used data preprocessing method by Kevin Mader and model building method by brucechou1983. Updated image proprocessing method: center cropping, 0-1 normalization, mean/std normalization. Train on 14 classes. \ncnn6: Used data preprocessing method and model building method by brucechou1983. Followed the styles of optimizer, learningratescheduler, class_weights. Train on 14 classes. \ncnn7: Used data preprocessing method and model building method by brucechou1983.
