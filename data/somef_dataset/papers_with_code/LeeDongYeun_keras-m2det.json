If an annotation doesn't have anchors available, it means it won't contribute to training. It is normal for a small amount of annotations to show up in red, but if most or all annotations are red there is cause for concern. The most common issues are that the annotations are too small or too oddly shaped (stretched out). \n",

Results using the `cocoapi` are shown below (note: according to the paper, this configuration should achieve a mAP of 0.357).\n\n```\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.350\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.537\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.374\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.191\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.383\n Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.472\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=  1 ] = 0.306\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets= 10 ] = 0.491\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.533\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.345\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.577\n Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.681\n```\n\nFor training on Open Images Dataset [OID](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)\nor taking place to the [OID challenges](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/challenge.html), run:\n```shell\n#: Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_m2det/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID\n\n#: Using the installed script:\nm2det-train oid /path/to/OID\n\n#: You can also specify a list of labels if you want to train on a subset\n#: by adding the argument 'labels_filter':\nkeras_m2det/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --labels-filter=Helmet,Tree\n\n#: You can also specify a parent label if you want to train on a branch\n#: from the semantic hierarchical tree (i.e a parent and all children)\n(https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/challenge_2018/bbox_labels_500_hierarchy_visualizer/circle.html)\n#: by adding the argument 'parent-label':\nkeras_m2det/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --parent-label=Boat\n```\n\n\nFor training on [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php), run:\n```shell\n#: Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_m2det/bin/train.py kitti /path/to/KITTI\n\n#: Using the installed script:\nm2det-train kitti /path/to/KITTI\n\nIf you want to prepare the dataset you can use the following script:\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/examples/object-detection/prepare_kitti_data.py\n```\n\n\nFor training on a [custom dataset], a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data.\nSee below for more details on the format of these CSV files.\nTo train using your CSV, run:\n```shell\n#: Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_m2det/bin/train.py csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes\n\n#: Using the installed script:\nm2det-train csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes\n```\n\nIn general, the steps to train on your own datasets are:\n1) Create a model by calling for instance `keras_m2det.models.backbone('resnet50').retinanet(num_classes=80)` and compile it.\n   Empirically, the following compile arguments have been found to work well:\n```python\nmodel.compile(\n    loss={\n        'regression'    : keras_m2det.losses.smooth_l1(),\n        'classification': keras_m2det.losses.focal()\n    },\n    optimizer=keras.optimizers.adam(lr=1e-5, clipnorm=0.001)\n)\n```\n2) Create generators for training and testing data (an example is show in [`keras_m2det.preprocessing.pascal_voc.PascalVocGenerator`](https://github.com/LeeDongYeun/keras-m2det/blob/master/keras_m2det/preprocessing/pascal_voc.py)).\n3) Use `model.fit_generator` to start training.\n\n",
