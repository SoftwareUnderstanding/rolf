      "excerpt": "This capstone project would be aimed at building an image classification model using convulated neural networks that will identify the following 4 categories of products: backpacks, clothing, footwear and watches. The source data to construct this model will be based on 20,000 images scraped from Amazon, the world's largest online retailer. Based on this, a recognition model will be used to correctly class a certain product image. Secondly, a recommendation system would be built to promote the closest matches based on a select product image.\n\nStakeholders will be the e-commerce companies and the user of the services themselves. It will help the company improve the effectiveness of potential transactions. It will also improve the user experience with more accuracy and also to avoid problems arising from wrongly identifying products. Often, users may want to source for similar looking items and a recommender would help to efficiently match a user's preferences to similar postings, giving rise to increased transactions and sales turnover.\n\nThe detailed solution to this would be to make use of unsupervised machine learning via neural networks in order to perform multi-classification of product categories. Dimensional clustering can also be used in order to match similar looking product images for the recommender system.\n\nMetrics used to measure the performance would be accuracy using majority class and also compared to Imagenet pre-trained model performance, to be within 5 percentage points. Challenges foreseen would be lack of sufficient data, complex background noise or poor resolution images.\n\n",

      "excerpt": "E-commerce sites have thousands of listings everyday and at times, the users may not be correctly classifying their uploaded image or be using the wrong product depiction. Mismatch of product listing information will decrease the effectiveness of succssful transactions and also result in unnecessary resources being utilitzed to perform these corrections on a large scale. A product detection system would help to ensure the correct listing and categorization of products or to assist the user in classifying product types. To meet this need, an image classifer will be trained and developed to accurately identify the correct image labels with the use of convulated neural networks. Customized CNN architecture and fine-tuned VGG-16 models will be used to analyse classification effectiveness. The aim is to have a self-constructed network model within 5 percentage points of a tested award winning pre-trained model.\n\nAlso, in order to boost listings and sales, it would be desirable to have an image recommendation system, based on deep learning,to present product images which are visually similar to previous posting images viewed by the user. Making use of nearest neighbours, a model will also be developed to match closest resembling products images within a particular category.\n\n\n",
