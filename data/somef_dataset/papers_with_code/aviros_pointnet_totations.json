It is list of numbers in between 0-7 represents the pi/2 rotation upon the axis. i.e, 3 represents X not rotate, Y rotate, Z rotate)\n\nThen, Classifier is learned on top of previous network. Exampled usage:\n\t\n\tpython trainClasiffiers.py \\\n\t--model_save_path=fc3_stop_gradient_4rotations \\\n\t--model_restore_path=fourRotations \\\n\t--fc_layers_number=3 \\\n\t--freeze_weights='True'\n\n(Note: 'model_restore_path'  have to be consistent with the same name of 'model_save_path' parameter from trainRotation.py, as it use the trained parameters of previous network at initialization)\n\nLog files and network parameters will be saved to `log` folder in default. Point clouds of <a href=\"http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">ModelNet40</a> models in HDF5 files will be automatically downloaded (416MB) to the data folder. Each point cloud contains 2048 points uniformly sampled from a shape surface. Each cloud is zero-mean and normalized into an unit sphere. There are also text files in `data/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048` specifying the ids of shapes in h5 files.\n\nTo see HELP for the training script:\n\nWe can use TensorBoard to view the network architecture and monitor the training progress.\n\n    tensorboard --logdir log\n",
