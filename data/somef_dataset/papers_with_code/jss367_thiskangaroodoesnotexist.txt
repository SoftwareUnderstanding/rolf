Code for website generating fake images of kangaroos

The code is from this implementation of the Improved GAN idea: https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models/blob/master/GAN/improved_wasserstein_gan/wgan_gp_tensorflow.py

The paper is here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf

Future thoughts:

If we gave it enough photos of different animals, could it be expanded to create animals that don't exist (iNaturalist data?)?
