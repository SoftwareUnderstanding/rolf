You can use mmdet3d through `pip install mmdet3d`.\r\n\r\n### Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- Support Batch Inference (#95, #103, #116): MMDetection3D v0.6.0 migrates to support batch inference based on MMDetection >= v2.4.0. This change influences all the test APIs in MMDetection3D and downstream codebases.\r\n- Start to use collect environment function from MMCV (#113): MMDetection3D v0.6.0 migrates to use `collect_env` function in MMCV.\r\n`get_compiler_version` and `get_compiling_cuda_version` compiled in `mmdet3d.ops.utils` are removed.
