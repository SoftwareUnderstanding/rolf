# Wasserstein Embedding for Graph Learning (WEGL)

This reposority contains a sample implementation code pertaining to our recent work, [Wasserstein Embedding for Graph Learning (WEGL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09430), in which we leverage the linear optimal transport (LOT) theory to introduce a novel and fast framework for embedding entire graphs in a vector space that can then be used for graph classification tasks.

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository runs WEGL on the OGBG-molhiv dataset from the [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu/), achieving state-of-the-art results on molecular property prediction using a downstream random forest classifier with much-reduced training complexity compared to the existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches.
