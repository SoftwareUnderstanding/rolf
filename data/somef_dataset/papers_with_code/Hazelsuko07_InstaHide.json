      "excerpt": "InstaHide[1] is a practical instance-hiding method for image data encryption in privacy-sensitive distributed deep learning. \nInstaHide uses the Mixup[2] method with a one-time secret key consisting of a pixel-wise random sign-flipping mask and samples from the same training dataset (Inside-dataset InstaHide) or a large public dataset (Cross-dataset InstaHide). It can be easily plugged into an existing distributed learning pipeline, and is very efficient and incurs minor reduction on accuracy. \nWe also release a challenge to further investigate the security of InstaHide. \n",
