# 2D human pose estimation with DSNT

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a
[ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) or
[Stacked Hourglass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06937) model
on the [MPII Human Pose dataset](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/)
using the differentiable spatial to numerical transform (DSNT).

If you want to use DSNT in your own project, check out [dsntnn](https://github.com/anibali/dsntnn)
instead. `dsntnn` is a small, self-contained library containing all of the operations required
for DSNT, the loss function, and regularization terms.

## Requirements

### Dataset

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to set the desired location for the MPII Human Pose
dataset on your computer.

Next, download and install the MPII Human Pose dataset:

```
$ ./run.sh python
>>> from torchdata import mpii
>>> mpii.install_mpii_dataset('/datasets/mpii')
```

## Running scripts

### Tests

```bash
$ ./run.sh pytest
```

### Training

1. [Optional] Start the Showoff server. Showoff is a visualisation server which can be used to
   display metrics while training.
   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up -d showoff
   ```
2. Run the training script (pass `--showoff=""` if not using Showoff).
   ```bash
   $ ./run.sh src/dsnt/bin/train.py --epochs=100
   ```
3. Wait until the training finishes. If using Showoff, you can monitor progress by going to
   [http://localhost:16676](http://localhost:16676).

### Inference

`bin/infer.py` may be used to generate predictions from trained models on the
MPII dataset. The predictions can be written to HDF5 files compatible with
[eval-mpii-pose](https://github.com/anibali/eval-mpii-pose). This is especially
useful for generating Matlab submission files which are compatible with the
official MPII evaluation code.

## Other implementations

If you write an implementation of DSNT, please let me know so that I can add it
to the list.
