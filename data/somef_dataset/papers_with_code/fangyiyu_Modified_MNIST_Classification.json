So I built the gated convolutional layer based on the mechanism below: \nThe architecture of the GCN model built in this task is the same as the CNN model above, and the loss function and optimizer are also identical.

After training for 15 epochs, the accuracy on the training and testing dataset are 0.9283 and 0.9689 respectively. \nA simple CNN, RNN or GCN model is not powerful enough to capture the patterns in the training dataset, in other words, they underfit the modified MNIST dataset, to address underfitting, we could try using a bigger neural network by adding new layers or increasing the number of neurons in existing layers or training the models for longer; therefore, I implemented a more sophiscated model-VGG on the dataset, and it turned out to fit the dataset well.  \n",
