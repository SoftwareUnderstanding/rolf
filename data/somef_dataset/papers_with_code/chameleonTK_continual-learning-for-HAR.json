      "excerpt": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been developed for a long time. Many highly accurate models were proposed. However, one major obstacle towards the real-life smart home is the ability to adapt to change. \n\nThis project aims to develop a continual learning model that is able to learn a new task but also retain previously learned tasks. The key technique used here is **generative replay**. Two agents are working together: one generative model is to mimic all trained lesson while one fully-connected neural network is to gradually lean to capture structured knowledge.\n\nSee technical detail [here](Reports/final-report.pdf)\n\n\nIt is an part of [CS5099 Dissertation](https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/modules/CS5099.html) at University of St. Andrews.\n\n\n",
