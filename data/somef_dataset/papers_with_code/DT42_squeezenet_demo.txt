# SqueezeNet Keras Implementation
This is the Keras implementation of SqueezeNet using functional API (arXiv [1602.07360](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07360.pdf)).
SqueezeNet is a small model of AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size.
The original model was implemented in [caffe](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet).

## Reference
[pysqueezenet by yhenon](https://github.com/yhenon/pysqueezenet)

Differences:
* Switch from Graph model to Keras 1.0 functional API
* Fix the bug of pooling layer 
* Many thanks to [StefOe](https://github.com/StefOe), the source can now support Keras 2.0 API.

## Result
This repository contains only the Keras implementation of the model, for other parameters used, please see the demo script, [squeezenet_demo.py](https://github.com/tammyyang/simdat/blob/devel/examples/keras/squeezenet_demo.py) in the simdat package.

The training process uses a total of 2,600 images with 1,300 images per class (so, total two classes only).
There are a total 130 images used for validation. After 20 epochs, the model achieves the following:
```
loss: 0.6563 - acc: 0.7065 - val_loss: 0.6247 - val_acc: 0.8750
```
