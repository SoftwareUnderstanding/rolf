# ResNet/
ResNet/ contains my pytorch implimentation of a ResNet50 based on the arcitecture described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385

In order to test the models ability to both bound and classify image data, I have used the public dataset MIT http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
- Image Data http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/images.tar
- Annotation Data http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/annotation.tar
