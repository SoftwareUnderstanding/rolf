      "excerpt": "An unofficial TensorFlow 2 implementation of Trainable Resizer and Vision Transformer joint training model (LResizerViT). Below is the overall proposed learnable resizer blocks. \nIt's shown how we can train a higher resolution image for vision transformer model. Usually transformer based models with high resolutoin may not fit into GPU. In such cases, we can adopt a Trainable Resizer mechanism as a backbone of the transformer models and perform as a joint  learning of the image resizer and recognition models. \nLearning to Resize Images for Computer Vision Tasks - Google Research. For a given image resolutoin and a model, this research work answer how to best resize that image in a target resolutoin. Off-the-shelf image resizers for example: bilinear, bicubic methods are commonly used in most of the machine learning softwares. But this may limit the on-task performance of the trained model. In the above work, it's shown that typical linear resizer can be replaced with the Learned Resizer. \nVision Transformer - Google Research. We know that the transformer models are computationally expensive. And thus limits the input size roughly around 224, 384. So, the idea is to use this resizer mechanism as a bacbone of the vision transformer, so that we can input enough large image for joint learning. So, the overall model architecture would be  \n",
