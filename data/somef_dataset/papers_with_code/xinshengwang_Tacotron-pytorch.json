      "excerpt": "* Text processing\n\n    Refer to ```bash/text-to-seq``` to preprocess the input transcriptions. In this script, ```save_dir ``` will be the text input dir in the training script. \n    ```\n    python text_processing.py \\\n        --txt_dir=${the path to the text dir} \\\n        --save_dir=${dir to save texts_seq}\n    ``` \n* Training\n\n    This code supports kinds of attention mechanisms and reference embedding methods. You can define the specific model within a hyperparameter config file. In ```/bash```, there are already several set hyperparameter files.  You can follow the script ```bash/gst-train.sh``` to start the training.\n    ```\n    python main.py \\\n        --cfg_file= config/gst-tts.yaml \\\n        --txt_dir=/path to/texts_seq \\\n        --mel_dir=/path to/mels \\\n        --file_dir=/path to filename dir \\\n        --save_root=/logdir \\\n        --train \n    ```\n    Note that \"--file_dir\" is a directory to save/load filenames for training and test. You don't have to manually create these files. If not filename file exists, this code will create them.  \n\n",
