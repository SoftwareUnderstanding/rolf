# ðŸ›‘ Note: This model is still not reliable to use. It is just a research for now. 

To read Motivation and Goal behind this research go to this [Github Repository](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset/blob/master/README.md).
# Dataset 
```
dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ covid19 [32 entries]
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ normal [25 entries]
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pneumonia [20 entries]
â”œâ”€â”€ train
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ covid19 [219 entries]
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ normal [210 entries]
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pneumonia [210 entries]
â””â”€â”€ validate
    â”œâ”€â”€ covid19 [32 entries]
    â”œâ”€â”€ normal [20 entries]

Soon more data will be added


# Model Design
## covidcnn161
It is a custom model designed using Residual Blocks. Learn more about [Residual block](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

![model_161](model/images/Covidcnn_161.svg)

* New model based on **Densenet moudule** comming soon.

# Model Result

![Model Accuracy](model/images/modelAccuracy_100.png)
![Model Loss](model/images/modelLoss_100.png)

* This model was trained on **very small sets of images**, therfore the model is not **generalized** enough to use. 

# Usage
```
$python3 detect.py --help
usage: detect.py [-h] -m MODEL -i IMAGE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        path to model
  -i IMAGE, --image IMAGE
                        path to input image

```
Example
```
python3 detect.py -m model/trained_model/covid-19_large.h5 -i model/samples/normal.jpeg 
```


# Deploying model

After the model was trained it was compressed into [tflite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) model. After which it was 
deployed on [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application.
