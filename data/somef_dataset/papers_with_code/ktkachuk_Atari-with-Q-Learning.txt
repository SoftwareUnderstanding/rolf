# Atari with Q-Learning
This directory contains the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning agent which plays the Atari game Breakout. The agent was trained with Q-Learning.

The Jupyter notebook contains all explanations, illustrations, equations and the complete code. It can be used as a standalone. In addition the code is split in two .py files (training and playing) for ad hoc usage.

A pretrained model was also added to serve as a showcase. The model is not fully converged, but archives an average score of 23 points per game.
