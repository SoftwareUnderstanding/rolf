# Q&A
- Q: Why do not use distribution Q to supervise distribution P directly?<br>
  A: The reasons are two-fold: 1) Previous method has considered to use the clustering assignments as pseudo labels to re-train the encoder in a supervised manner, i.e., [deepCluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05520). However, in experiment, we find that the gradient of cross-entropy loss is too violent to prevent the embedding spaces from disturbance. 2) Although we can replace the cross-entropy loss with KL divergence, there is still a problem that we worried about, that is, there is no clustering information. The original intention of our research on deep clustering is to integrate the objective of clustering into the powerful representation ability of deep learning. Therefore, we introduce the distribution P to increase the cohesion of clustering performance, the details can be found in [DEC](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/xieb16.pdf).

- Q: How to apply SDCN to other datasets?<br>
  A: In general, if you want to apply our model to other datasets, three steps are required.
  1) Construct the KNN graph based on the similarity of features. Details can be found in ```calcu_graph.py```.
  2) Pretrain the autoencoder and save the pre-trained model. Details can be found in ```data/pretrain.py```.
  3) Replace the args in ```sdcn.py``` and run the code.
