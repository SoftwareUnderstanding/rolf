Notes:<br>
FCOS No Tricks means the setting is same as original paper, i.e., centerness is on cls branch, GN is added, use P5 instead of C5,
and other setting like norm_on_bbox, centerness_on_reg, center_sampling is set to False. The mAP reported by the original paper is 0.371.
For more information about FCOS, please see [fcos.md](docs/fcos.md)

For OpenPose, please go into https://github.com/kohillyang/mx-openpose for more information.

RFCN trained on VOC is reported as mAP@IoU=0.5 according to VOC Metric, and it is slightly different from mAP @IoU=0.5 of COCO.

MS means the model is using multi-scaling when training.

FPN(MS) and RFCN are bought from <https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets> and rewritten by new Gluon API,
their performance should be same with the model from <https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets>.
