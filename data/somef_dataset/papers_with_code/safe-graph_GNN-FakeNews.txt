This repo includes the Pytorch-Geometric implementation of a series of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based fake news detection models.
All [GNN models](#user-guide) are implemented and evaluated under the User Preference-aware Fake News Detection ([UPFD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12259.pdf)) framework.
The fake news detection problem is instantiated as a graph classification task under the UPFD framework. 

You can make reproducible run on [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7305473/tree) without manual configuration.

The UPFD dataset and its example usage is also available at the PyTorch-Geometric official repo

We welcome contributions of results of existing models and the SOTA results of new models based on our dataset.
You can check the [benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/upfd) hosted by PaperWithCode for SOTA models and their performances.

## Installation

### Install via PyG

Our [dataset](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/torch_geometric/datasets/upfd.py) has been integrated with the official PyTorch-Geometric library. Please follow the installation instructions of [PyTorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) to install the latest version of PyG and check the [code example](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/upfd.py) for dataset usage.


### Install via DGL

Our [dataset](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/python/dgl/data/fakenews.py) has been integrated with the official [Deep Graph library](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl)(DGL). Please follow the installation instructions of [DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) to install the latest version of DGL and check the [docstring](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/python/dgl/data/fakenews.py) of the dataset class for dataset usage.

### Manually Install

To run the code in this repo, you need to have `Python>=3.6`, `PyTorch>=1.6`, and `PyTorch-Geometric>=1.6.1`.
Please follow the installation instructions of [PyTorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) to install PyG.

Other dependencies can be installed using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews.git
cd GNN-FakeNews
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

If you have installed the latest version of PyG or DGL, you can use their built-in dataloaders to download and load the UPFD dataset.

If you install the project manually, you can download the dataset (1.2GB) via the links below and
unzip the data under the `\data` directory.

The dataset includes fake&real news propagation networks on Twitter built according to fact-check information from
[Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/) and [Gossipcop](https://www.gossipcop.com/).
The news retweet graphs were originally extracted by [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet).
We crawled near 20 million historical tweets from users who participated in fake news propagation in FakeNewsNet to
generate node features in the dataset.

The statistics of the dataset is shown below:

| Data  | #Graphs  | #Fake News| #Total Nodes  | #Total Edges  | #Avg. Nodes per Graph  |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Politifact | 314   |   157    |  41,054  | 40,740 |  131 |
| Gossipcop |  5464  |   2732   |  314,262  | 308,798  |  58  |


Due to the Twitter policy, we could not release the crawled user historical tweets publicly.
To get the corresponding Twitter user information, you can refer to news lists and the node_id-twitter_id mappings under `\data`.
Two `.pkl` files include the dictionaries with the keys as the node_ids in the datasets and the values represent corresponding Twitter user_ids.
In the UPFD project, we use [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) and [Twitter Developer API](https://developer.twitter.com/en) to get the user information.

We incorporate four node feature types in the dataset, the 768-dimensional `bert` and 300-dimensional `spacy` features 
are encoded using pretrained [BERT](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg) word2vec, respectively.
The 10-dimensional `profile` feature is obtained from a Twitter account's profile.
You can refer to [profile_feature.py](https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews/blob/master/utils/profile_feature.py) for profile feature extraction.
The 310-dimensional `content` feature is composed of a 300-dimensional user comment word2vec (spaCy) embedding
plus a 10-dimensional profile feature.

Each graph is a hierarchical tree-structured graph where the root node represents the news, the leaf nodes are Twitter users who retweeted the root news.
A user node has an edge to the news node if he/she retweeted the news tweet. Two user nodes have an edge if one user retweeted the news tweet from the other user.
The following figure shows the UPFD framework including the dataset construction details 
You can refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00625.pdf) for more details about the dataset.

## Models

All GNN-based fake news detection models are under the `\gnn_model` directory.
You can fine-tune each model according to arguments specified in the argparser of each model.
The implemented models are as follows:

Since the UPFD framework is built upon the [PyG](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric), you can easily try other graph classification models
like [GIN](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/mutag_gin.py) and [HGP-SL](https://github.com/cszhangzhen/HGP-SL)
under our dataset.
