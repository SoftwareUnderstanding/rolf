Please contact with any questions. \nIn the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, we want to improve prognostic predictions to triage and manage patient care. Data is the first step to developing any diagnostic/prognostic tool. While there exist large public datasets of more typical chest X-rays from the NIH [Wang 2017], Spain [Bustos 2019], Stanford [Irvin 2019], MIT [Johnson 2019] and Indiana University [Demner-Fushman 2016], there is no collection of COVID-19 chest X-rays or CT scans designed to be used for computational analysis. \nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) presents several unique features Fang, 2020 and Ai 2020. While the diagnosis is confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images with a pattern that is only moderately characteristic for the human eye Ng, 2020. In late January, a Chinese team published a paper detailing the clinical and paraclinical features of COVID-19. They reported that patients present abnormalities in chest CT images with most having bilateral involvement Huang 2020. Bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation constitute the typical findings in chest CT images of intensive care unit (ICU) patients on admission Huang 2020. In comparison, non-ICU patients show bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation in their chest CT images Huang 2020. In these patients, later chest CT images display bilateral ground-glass opacity with resolved consolidation Huang 2020. \nOur goal is to use these images to develop AI based approaches to predict and understand the infection. Our group will work to release these models using our open source Chester AI Radiology Assistant platform. \nThe tasks are as follows using chest X-ray or CT (preference for X-ray) as input to predict these tasks: \n",
