      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870\n\n## 1. Problem\n\nIdentifying a fruit in an image and drawing a bounding box on it\n\n## 2. What is Fruit Detection Dataset \n\nThe data we're using is from Kaggle's Fruit Images for Object Detection competition \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/mbkinaci/fruit-images-for-object-detection\n\n## 3. Why Fruit Detection ?\nRobotic harvesting can provide a potential solution for the ever-increasing labour costs and increasing fruit quality For these reasons, there has been growing interest in the use of agricultural robots for harvesting fruit and vegetables over the past three decades\n\n## 4. Workflow\nThe Workflow is quite simple Since we'll be using transfer learning on the Mask-RCNN model already trained on the famous COCO Dataset"
