      "excerpt": "In this version, we also support training from multiple folders. With the assumption that we may need to train the BERT with samples length of 128 first, and then 256 and 512. Please note that we only support the 2-level directory, it means we have to put all the training data to the second-level subfolders under the root folder, which we defined by parameter --tokens_dir when training. E.g: \n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 root_tokens_dir\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokens_128\n\u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 training tokens files ...\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokens_256\n\u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 training tokens files ...\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tokens_512\n|        \u251c\u2500\u2500 training tokens files ...\n```\nWhen training, each tokens subfolder will be trained sequentially with a particular batch-size and number of epochs as well. The list of tokens subfolders needs to be defined by parameter --tokens_dir_list, while the list of batch-sizes and epochs correspond to --batch_size_list and --epochs_list. If we don't define the  --batch_size_list and --epochs_list, all tokens subfolder will be trained with the same batch-size and number of epochs, which are defined by the parameters --training_batch_size and --epochs. An example of configurations is below: \n```\n--tokens_dir_list=tokens_128,tokens_256,tokens_512\n--batch_size_list=32,16,8\n--epochs_list=2,4,6\n```\nWe also support a special mode called various length training. Activate this mode by adding parameter --train_various_length. It's pretty the same with training with multiple folders. The only difference is that we only use one Optimizer/Scheduler during the training process, instead of each Optimizer/Scheduler for each tokens subfolder. \n\n",
