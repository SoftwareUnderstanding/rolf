      "excerpt": "The simplest way to get started for generation is to use the default pre-trained\nversion of T5 on ONNX included in the package.\n\n> **_NOTE:_**  Please note that the first time you call get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer, the models are\nbeing downloaded which might take a minute or two.\n\n```python\nfrom onnxt5 import GenerativeT5\nfrom onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer\ndecoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()\ngenerative_t5 = GenerativeT5(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, onnx=True)\nprompt = 'translate English to French: I was a victim of a series of accidents.'\n\noutput_text, output_logits = generative_t5(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.)\n#: output_text: \"J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une s\u00e9rie d'accidents.\"\n```\n\nOther tasks just require to change the prefix in your prompt, for instance for summarization:\n```python\nprompt = 'summarize: <PARAGRAPH>'\noutput_text, output_logits = generative_t5(prompt, max_length=100, temperature=0.)\n```\n\nIf you want to get the embeddings of text, you can run the following\n```python\nfrom onnxt5.api import get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer, run_embeddings_text\n\ndecoder_sess, encoder_sess, tokenizer = get_encoder_decoder_tokenizer()\nprompt = 'Listen, Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.'\nencoder_embeddings, decoder_embeddings = run_embeddings_text(encoder_sess, decoder_sess, tokenizer, prompt)\n```\n\nONNXT5 also lets you export and use your own models. See the `examples\\` folder for more detailed examples.\n\nT5 works with tokens such as `summarize:`, `translate English to German:`, or `question: ... context:`. You can see a \nlist of the pretrained tasks and token in the appendix D of the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).\n\n",
