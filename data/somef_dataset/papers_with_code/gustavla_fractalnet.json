There is still no public release of local+global, but we suggest\nimplementing this through tying weights. \n\nCaffe\n~~~~~\nSee the ``caffe`` directory for code and more information.\n\nFractal pattern generation\n--------------------------\nWiring up a fractal network manually would take hours, so we provide simple\nPython scripts that will do it for you. See the ``generation`` directory for\ncode and more information.\n\nData augmentation\n-----------------\nWe use a Python layer in Caffe to implement data augmentation. It is not yet\navailable here.\n\nCite\n----\nIf this is useful to you, please consider citing us::\n\n    @article{larsson2016fractalnet,\n      title={FractalNet: Ultra-Deep Neural Networks without Residuals},\n      author={Larsson, Gustav and Maire, Michael and Shakhnarovich, Gregory},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.07648},\n      year={2016}\n    }\n",
