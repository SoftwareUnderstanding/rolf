      "excerpt": "This repository contains our Tensorflow implementation for MHAL, a multi-head attention labeller that performs joint text classification on multiple compositional levels (i.e., both at the sentence and world level).  \nMHAL is an instance of multi-task learning; it uses hard parameter sharing to perform two tasks: sequence labelling and sentence classification. By design, these two tasks are intertwined and learned jointly. The token-level predictions are directly extracted from the attention evidence scores, which are in turn used to build sentence-level representations and predictions.  \nDue to its architectural design and the fluid transfer of knowledge between compositional levels, MHAL can be instantiated (and perform reasonably well) as a zero-shot sequence labeller. This means that, without receiving any supervision signal on the sentence-level, MHAL can perform sophisticated word-level classifications. For instance, given a sentence like \"John Smith lives in Cambridge\" whose label is, say, \"E\" (meaning that it contains named entities) MHAL can label \"John Smith\" as a person and \"Cambridge\" as a location (see visualizations of this task below).  \nMHAL is a robust and versatile model. It extracts knowledge at different levels of granularity and fluidly transfers it between tasks. \nOur paper \"Seeing Both the Forest and the Trees: Multi-head Attention for Joint Classification on Different Compositional Levels\" (by Miruna Pislar and Marek Rei) has been published at COLING 2020 (see citation instructions at the bottom). \nIn natural languages, words are used in association to construct sentences. It is not words in isolation, but the appropriate combination of hierarchical structures that conveys the meaning of the whole sentence. Neural networks can capture expressive language features; however, insights into the link between words and sentences are difficult to acquire automatically. In this work, we design a deep neural network architecture that explicitly wires lower and higher linguistic components; we then evaluate its ability to perform the same task at different hierarchical levels. Settling on broad text classification tasks, we show that our model, MHAL, learns to simultaneously solve them at different levels of granularity by fluidly transferring knowledge between hierarchies. Using a multi-head attention mechanism to tie the representations between single words and full sentences, MHAL systematically outperforms equivalent models that are not incentivized towards developing compositional representations. Moreover, we demonstrate that, with the proposed architecture, the sentence information flows naturally to individual words, allowing the model to behave like a sequence labeller (which is a lower, word-level task) even without any word supervision, in a zero-shot fashion. \nThe architecture is based on BiLSTMs that builds contextual vector representations for each word. These vectors are then passed through a multi-head attention mechanism, which predicts label distributions for both individual words and the whole sentence. Each attention head is incentivized to be predictive of a particular label, allowing the system to also assign labels to individual words while composing a sentence-level representation for sentence classification. \n",

      "excerpt": "In addition to the standard NLL objectives for sentence classification and sequence labelling, MHAL makes use of some auxiliary objectives: \n* a language modelling loss (configurable to be char and/or word-based) that facilitates the 'acquisition' of linguistic knowledge  \n* an attention loss, to enable a fluid label transfer between compositional levels, ensuring that the attention weights reflect the ground truth of the sentence \n* a regularization term that encourages the learning of sentence-averaged queries that are truly diverse across labels (so, it imposes the construction of a distinct subspace for each label in the tagset) \nMHAL was tested on named entity recognition (CoNLL-2003 dataset), sentiment analysis (Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset), and grammatical error detection (FCE dataset). For all of these datasets, annotations are available either 1) for both individual words and full sentences or 2) only for the words, but we can infer the labels for the sentences. See paper for details. \nThe training and test data is expected in standard CoNLL-type. There is one word per line, with an arbitrary number of tab-separated values. The first value must be the word, the last one is its label. Each sentence is separated by an extra empty line. If the sentence labels are also specified, then they precede all the constituent words and have to start with sent_label followed by an equal number of columns as the tokens, the last one being the sentence label.
