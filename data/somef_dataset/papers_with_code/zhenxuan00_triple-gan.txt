# Triple Generative Adversarial Nets (Triple-GAN)
## [Chongxuan Li](https://github.com/zhenxuan00), [Kun Xu](https://github.com/taufikxu), Jun Zhu and Bo Zhang

Code for reproducing most of the results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02291). Triple-GAN: a unified GAN model for classification and class-conditional generation in semi-supervised learning.

Warning: the code is still under development.


## Triple-GAN-V2 and code in Pytorch!

We propose Triple-GAN-V2 built upon mean teacher classifier and projection discriminator with spectral norm and implement Triple-GAN in Pytorch. See the source code at https://github.com/taufikxu/Triple-GAN

## Results

Triple-GAN can achieve excellent classification results on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR10 datasets, see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02291) for a comparison with the previous state-of-the-art. See generated images as follows:
