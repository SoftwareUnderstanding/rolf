# Image-Captioning-with-Translation

Image Captioning is one of the most basic application of Natural Language Processing with immense application in many places.
 
## Technical Points

1) The model was trained on MS-COCO dataset. The dataset was downloaded from the given link "http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip".

*NOTE: The dataset is almost 15 GB in size so make sure to have a suffiecient strong Internet Connection*

2) The model was trained for 150 epochs with a batch size of 64. The batch size can be altered as per the system requirements.
3) Attention mechanism was deployed in this model. To learn about more about the attention mechanism go to the following site "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473"

4) Google translate was used to convert the caption into various languages. In the model.py the caption generated were in English, Hindi and Bengali.

## Applications

1) ICT can be used as an additional attachment for the blind stick where the person can get accurate captions along with the directions given by the blind stick.

2) Moreover it can be used as a fun project for demonstrating and understanding the essence of Natural Language Processing.
