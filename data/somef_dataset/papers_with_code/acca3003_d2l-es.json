    "excerpt": "Contributing to This Book\n:label:sec_how_to_contribute\nContributions by readers help us improve this book. If you find a typo, an outdated link, something where you think we missed a citation, where the code does not look elegant or where an explanation is unclear, please contribute back and help us help our readers. While in regular books the delay between print runs (and thus between typo corrections) can be measured in years, it typically takes hours to days to incorporate an improvement in this book. This is all possible due to version control and continuous integration testing. To do so you need to submit a pull request to the GitHub repository. When your pull request is merged into the code repository by the author, you will become a contributor.\nMinor Text Changes\nThe most common contributions are editing one sentence or fixing typos. We recommend you to find the source file in the github repo and edit the file directly. For example, you can search the file through the Find file button (:numref:fig_edit_file) to locate the source file, which is a markdown file. Then you click the \"Edit this file\" button on the upper-right corner to make your changes in the markdown file.\n\n:width:300px\n:label:fig_edit_file\nAfter you are done, fill in your change descriptions in the \"Propose file change\" panel on the page bottom and then click the \"Propose file change\" button. It will redirect you to a new page to review your changes (:numref:fig_git_createpr). If everything is good, you can submit a pull request by clicking the \"Create pull request\" button.\nPropose a Major Change\nIf you plan to update a large portion of text or code, then you need to know a little bit more about the format this book is using. The source file is based on the markdown format with a set of extensions through the d2lbook package such as referring to equations, images, chapters, and citations. You can use any Markdown editors to open these files and make your changes.\nIf you would like to change the code, we recommend you to use Jupyter to open these Markdown files as described in :numref:sec_jupyter. So that you can run and test your changes. Please remember to clear all outputs before submitting your changes, our CI system will execute the sections you updated to generate outputs.\nSome sections may support multiple framework implementations, you can use d2lbook to activate a particular framework, so other framework implementations become Markdown code blocks and will not be executed when you \"Run All\" in Jupyter. In other words, first install d2lbook by running\nbash\npip install git+https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-book\nThen in the root directory of d2l-en, you can activate a particular implementation by running one of the following commands:\nbash\nd2lbook activate mxnet chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp-scratch.md\nd2lbook activate pytorch chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp-scratch.md\nd2lbook activate tensorflow chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp-scratch.md\nBefore submitting your changes, please clear all code block outputs and activate all by\nbash\nd2lbook activate all chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp-scratch.md\nIf you add a new code block not for the default implementation, which is MXNet, please use #@tab to mark this block on the beginning line. For example, #@tab pytorch for a PyTorch code block, #@tab tensorflow for a TensorFlow code block, or #@tab all a shared code block for all implementations. You may refer to d2lbook for more information.\nAdding a New Section or a New Framework Implementation\nIf you want to create a new chapter, e.g. reinforcement learning, or add implementations of new frameworks, such as TensorFlow, please contact the authors first, either by emailing or using github issues.\nSubmitting a Major Change\nWe suggest you to use the standard git process to submit a major change. In a nutshell the process works as described in :numref:fig_contribute.\n\n:label:fig_contribute\nWe will walk you through the steps in detail. If you are already familiar with Git you can skip this section. For concreteness we assume that the contributor's user name is \"astonzhang\".\nInstalling Git\nThe Git open source book describes how to install Git. This typically works via apt install git on Ubuntu Linux, by installing the Xcode developer tools on macOS, or by using GitHub's desktop client. If you do not have a GitHub account, you need to sign up for one.\nLogging in to GitHub\nEnter the address of the book's code repository in your browser. Click on the Fork button in the red box at the upper-right of :numref:fig_git_fork, to make a copy of the repository of this book. This is now your copy and you can change it any way you want.\n\n:width:700px\n:label:fig_git_fork\nNow, the code repository of this book will be forked (i.e., copied) to your username, such as astonzhang/d2l-en shown at the upper-left of the screenshot :numref:fig_git_forked.\n\n:width:700px\n:label:fig_git_forked\nCloning the Repository\nTo clone the repository (i.e., to make a local copy) we need to get its repository address. The green button in :numref:fig_git_clone displays this. Make sure that your local copy is up to date with the main repository if you decide to keep this fork around for longer. For now simply follow the instructions in :ref:chap_installation to get started. The main difference is that you are now downloading your own fork of the repository.\n\n:width:700px\n:label:fig_git_clone\n```\nReplace your_github_username with your GitHub username\ngit clone https://github.com/your_github_username/d2l-en.git\n```\nEditing the Book and Push\nNow it is time to edit the book. It is best to edit the notebooks in Jupyter following instructions in :numref:sec_jupyter. Make the changes and check that they are OK. Assume we have modified a typo in the file ~/d2l-en/chapter_appendix_tools/how-to-contribute.md.\nYou can then check which files you have changed:\nAt this point Git will prompt that the chapter_appendix_tools/how-to-contribute.md file has been modified.\n```\nmylaptop:d2l-en me$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\nmodified:   chapter_appendix_tools/how-to-contribute.md\n\n```\nAfter confirming that this is what you want, execute the following command:\ngit add chapter_appendix_tools/how-to-contribute.md\ngit commit -m 'fix typo in git documentation'\ngit push\nThe changed code will then be in your personal fork of the repository. To request the addition of your change, you have to create a pull request for the official repository of the book.\nPull Request\nAs shown in :numref:fig_git_newpr, go to your fork of the repository on GitHub and select \"New pull request\". This will open up a screen that shows you the changes between your edits and what is current in the main repository of the book.\n\n:width:700px\n:label:fig_git_newpr\nSubmitting Pull Request\nFinally, submit a pull request by clicking the button as shown in :numref:fig_git_createpr. Make sure to describe the changes you have made in the pull request. This will make it easier for the authors to review it and to merge it with the book. Depending on the changes, this might get accepted right away, rejected, or more likely, you will get some feedback on the changes. Once you have incorporated them, you are good to go.\n\n:width:700px\n:label:fig_git_createpr\nYour pull request will appear among the list of requests in the main repository. We will make every effort to process it quickly.\nSummary\n\nYou can use GitHub to contribute to this book.\nYou can edit the file on GitHub directly for minor changes.\nFor a major change, please fork the repository, edit things locally and only contribute back once you are ready.\nPull requests are how contributions are being bundled up. Try not to submit huge pull requests since this makes them hard to understand and incorporate. Better send several smaller ones.\n\nExercises\n\nStar and fork the d2l-en repository.\nFind some code that needs improvement and submit a pull request.\nFind a reference that we missed and submit a pull request.\nIt is usually a better practice to create a pull request using a new branch. Learn how to do it with Git branching.\n\nDiscussions",
