      "excerpt": "\u00c6l\u00e6ctra is a Danish Transformer-based language model created to enhance the variety of Danish NLP resources with a more efficient model compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Initially a cased and an uncased model are released. It was created as part of a Cognitive Science bachelor's thesis. \n\u00c6l\u00e6ctra was pretrained with the ELECTRA-Small (Clark et al., 2020) pretraining approach by using the Danish Gigaword Corpus (Str\u00f8mberg-Derczynski et al., 2020) and evaluated on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Since NER only presents a limited picture of \u00c6l\u00e6ctra's capabilities I am very interested in further evaluations. Therefore, if you employ it for any task, feel free to hit me up your findings! \n\u00c6l\u00e6ctra was, as mentioned, created to enhance the Danish NLP capabilties and please do note how this GitHub still does not support the Danish characters \"\u00c6, \u00d8 and \u00c5\" as the title of this repository becomes \"-l-ctra\". How ironic.\ud83d\ude42 \nHere is an example on how to load both the cased and the uncased \u00c6l\u00e6ctra model in PyTorch using the \ud83e\udd17Transformers library: \n",
