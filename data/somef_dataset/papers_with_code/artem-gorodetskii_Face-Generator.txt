# Face-Generator
Jupyter notebook contains tensorflow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. 
It was trained on gray scale images from Kaggle competition (Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge). The training data can be downloaded using the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

The model contains modified network architecture proposed by A. Radford et all. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).
