DTranNER equips with deep learning-based label-label transition model to describe ever-changing contextual relations between neighboring labels.

In our implementation, the datasets are accessed via $PROJECT_HOME/data/. For details on NER datasets, please refer to A Neural Network Multi-Task Learning Approach to Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (Crichton et al. 2017). \nIn this study, we use IOBES tagging scheme. O denotes non-entity token, B denotes the first token of such an entity consisting of multiple tokens, I denotes the inside token of the entity, E denotes the last token, and S denotes a single-token-based entity. We are conducting experiments with IOB tagging scheme at this moment. It will be reported soon. \nHere we compare our model with recent state-of-the-art models on the five biomedical corpora mentioned above. We measure F1 score as the evaluation metric. The experimental results are shown in below the table. \n|Model | BC2GM | BC4CHEMD | BC5CDR-Chemical | BC5CDR-Disease | NCBI-disease| \n",
