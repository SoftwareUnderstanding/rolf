# light-reid
a toolbox of light reid for fast feature extraction and search 
- [x] light-model: model distillation (3x faster feature extraction)
- [x] light-feature: binary code learning (6x faster retrieval)
- [x] light-search: [coarse2fine search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06826) (2x faster retrieval)

it features
- [x] easy switch between light and non-light reid
- [x] simple modules for reid implementation
- [x] implementations of state-of-the-art deep reid models 


## What's New
- [2021.06]: we support [vision transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) as cnn backbones. please refer [base_config_duke_vit.yaml](./examples/bagtricks_buildwithconfigs/configs/base_config_duke_vit.yaml)
- [2020.12]: we release a strong pipeline for occluded/partial re-id. please refer [occluded_reid](./examples/occluded_reid)
- [2020.11]: we support pca_reduction to 128d with almost no accuracy drop. please refer [bagtricks_pca](./examples/bagtricks_pca)
- [2020.11]: we support build with config files, making coding more simple. please refer [bagtricks_buildwithconfigs](./examples/bagtricks_buildwithconfigs)
- [2020.08]: We release a toolbox of light-reid learning for faster inference, getting >30x faster speed.
- [2020.03]: We implement [BagTricks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930088) and support IBN-Net, MSMT17, combineall, multi-dataset train. Please see branch [version_py3.7_bot](https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid/tree/version_py3.7_bot).
- [2019.03]: We give a clean implemention of  [BagTricks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930088) with python2.7. Please see branch [version_py2.7](https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid/tree/version_py2.7).

## Installation
```shell script
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid.git

# create environment
cd light-reid
conda create -n lightreid python=3.7
conda activate lightreid

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements

# install torch and torchvision (select the proper cuda version to suit your machine)
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision -c pytorch
# install faiss for stable search
conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch
```

## Prepare Datasets

- download datasets that you need, [reid_datasets.md](./reid_datasets.md) lists various of datasets and their links.
- update datasets path at [./lightreid/data/datasets/datasetpaths.yaml](./lightreid/data/datasets/datasetpaths.yaml)

## Quick Start 
[1 step](./examples/bagtricks_buildwithconfigs) to build a SOTA reid model with configs


## Implemented reid methods and experimental results

- [x] [bagtricks_buildwithconfigs](./examples/bagtricks_buildwithconfigs): easily implement a strong reid baseline
- [x] [bagtricks_pca](./examples/bagtricks_pca): reduce feature dimension with PCA
- [x] [occluded_reid](./examples/occluded_reid): a simple&strong reid baseline for occluded reid
- [x] [generalizable_reid](./examples/generalizable_reid): a reid model performs well on multiple datasets
