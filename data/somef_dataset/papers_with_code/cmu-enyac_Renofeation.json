      "excerpt": "In our recent paper \"Renofeation: A Simple Transfer Learning Method for Improved Adversarial Robustness\", we show that numerous fine-tuning methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples based on the pre-trained model. This poses security concerns for indutrial applications that are based on fine-tuning such as Google's Cloud AutoML and Microsoft's Custom Vision. \nTo combat such attacks, we propose Re-training with noisy feature distillation or Renofeation. Renofeation does not start training from pre-trained weights but rather re-initialize the weights and train with noisy feature distillation. To instantiate noisy feature distillation, we incorporate spatial dropout and stochastic weight averaging with feature distillation to avoid over-fitting to the pre-trained feature without hurting the generalization performance, which in turn improves the robustness. \nTo this end, we demonstrate empirically that the attack success rate can be reduced from 74.3%, 65.7%, 70.3%, and 50.75% down to 6.9%, 4.4%, 4.9%, and 6.9% for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and MobileNetV2, respectively. Moreover, the clean-data performance is comparable to the fine-tuning baseline! \nFor more details and an ablation study of our proposed method, please check out our paper! \n",
