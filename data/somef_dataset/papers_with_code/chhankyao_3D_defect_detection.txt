# 3D Context Encoder for Defect Detection

## 3D model projection
- convert mesh models into point clouds
- rotate point cloud models
- render 3D point clouds into images
- create training data for context encoder

## Context encoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07379)
- network architecture: ResNet / U-Net
- loss: reconstruction loss + adversarial loss
