      "excerpt": "Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central \nproblem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of \noptimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on \nminimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking \nhigh-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this \npaper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable \nof inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an \nadversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is \n",
