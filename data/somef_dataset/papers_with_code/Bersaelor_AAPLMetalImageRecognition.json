      "excerpt": "This sample demonstrates how to perform runtime inference for image recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Metal Performance Shaders. This sample is a port of the TensorFlow-trained Inception_v3 network, which was trained offline using the ImageNet dataset. The CNN creates, encodes, and submits different layers to the GPU. It then performs image recognition using trained parameters (weights and biases) that have been acquired and saved from the pre-trained network.\n\nThe Network can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py\n\nInstructions to run this network on TensorFlow can be found here:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html#image-recognition\n\nThe Original Network Paper can be found here:\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf\n\nThe network parameters are included in binary .dat files that are memory-mapped when needed.\n\nThe weights for this particular network were batch normalized but for inference the following may be used for every feature channel separately to get the corresponding weights and bias:\n\nA = \ud835\udec4 / \u221a(s + 0.001), b = \u00df - ( A * m )\n\nW = w*A\n\ns: variance\nm: mean\n\ud835\udec4: gamma\n\u00df: beta\n\nw: weights of a feature channel\nb: bias of a feature channel\nW: batch nomalized weights\n\nThis is derived from:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167v3.pdf\n\n",
