# tf-skipgram
Skipgram models using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [TensorFlow Text](https://www.tensorflow.org/text) and [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy). This repository/future package bases of negative sampling Skipgram's way of learning to define models able to learn word or item representation.

## Word representation
This project aims to propose several ways to learn word representation:
* Word-level negative sampling Skipgram
* Subword-level negative sampling Skipgram
* Attentional Subword-level negative sampling Skipgram
* Contextual Subword-level negative sampling Skipgram from Transformer

## Recommendation
The second aim of this project is to provide models for item representation learning in the recommendation framework. Examples and experiments will focus on [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset.
