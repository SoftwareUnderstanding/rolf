Kindly refer to Project_Report.pdf for the detailed information about this work. All the codes have been already uploaded. \nThis is an implimentation of Mask R-CNN proposed by Facebook AI Research (Girshick et al) for water detection implemented in python3, Keras and Tensorflow based on (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). The Mask R-CNN model performes water curtain detection, draws bounding box around it and applies segmentation mask. \nUPDATE: The model now can also detect the person and can give the water distribution as a function of height. \nThe repository includes: \n* The source code of Mask R-CNN with Resnet 101 and FPN(Feature Pyramid Network) as backbone. \n* The implimentation detail of Mask R-CNN for water detection. \n",

      "excerpt": "Mask R-CNN model training requires annotated images. This work uses ```VGG-Image annotator-1.0.6``` for annotation, which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via-1.0.6.html). The VGG annotation tool is an online html web page which does not require any downloading and is very easy to use. The annotation tool gives annotation in ```.json``` file containg the x and y co-ordinates of annotated pixels.\n\n```\n\nCODE TIP:\nIf you are using VGG-Image annotator-1.0.6, than the code of this repository doesnot require any modification\nwhile training.\nSide Note: If your data set is in video instead of images, this repository includes the python code to sample\nvideo at predefined sampling rate into images. \n```\n",
