# Object Detection for Autonomous Driving application using YOLO V2 on Tensorflow and Keras

## Work from Deep learning Specialization : Course 4 : Week 3 : Assignment 1

### Implemented object detection using the very powerful YOLO model by dealing with bounding boxes.

Ideas are taken from the following two reasearch papers about YOLO model : Redmon et al., 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).

The model is capable of detecting 80 different classes listed under "coco_classes.txt"

### RESULTS:
