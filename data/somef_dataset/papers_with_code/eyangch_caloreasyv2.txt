# Caloreasyv2
This website can count your nutrition intake (work in progress) <br>
It's cool stuff.<br>
It can do stuff like keeping track of calories, fat, sugar, carbs, and protein.<br>
It can also scan barcodes to make entering foods easier. Barcode library: [QuaggaJS](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS) <br>
It also has a weird implementation of R-CNN (kind of functional). R-CNN paper: [arXiv:1311.2524](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) <br>
