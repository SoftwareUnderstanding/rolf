(This practice has also been widely used by various authors in the realization of the same papers about Covid with deep NN). \nBefore to train your model you have to set path for dataset. It is advisable to upload images only once and store them in an array (in our case you can find array in \"data\" folder).\nIn my case I've stored data in npy_32 (where 32 means size of images uploaded). \n\nTo train run: \n```sh\n$ python odenet_big.py\n```\n\n",
