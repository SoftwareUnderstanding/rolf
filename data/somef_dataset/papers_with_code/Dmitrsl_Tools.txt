## tsfresh

tsfresh is used to to extract characteristics from time series. Let’s assume you recorded the ambient temperature around your computer over one day as the following time series:

the time series
Now you want to calculate different characteristics such as the maximal or minimal temperature, the average temperature or the number of temporary temperature peaks:

some characteristics of the time series
Without tsfresh, you would have to calculate all those characteristics by hand. With tsfresh this process is automated and all those features can be calculated automatically.

Further tsfresh is compatible with pythons pandas and scikit-learn APIs, two important packages for Data Science endeavours in python.
