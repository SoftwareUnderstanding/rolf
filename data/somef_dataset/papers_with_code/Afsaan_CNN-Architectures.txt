2. Alexnet
	
	AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the 	 	 runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of 	graphics processing units (GPUs) during training

3. VGG

	The full name of VGG is the Visual Geometry Group, which belongs to the Department of Science and Engineering of Oxford University. It has released a series of convolutional network models beginning 		with VGG, which can be applied to face recognition and image classification, from VGG16 to VGG19. The original purpose of VGG's research on the depth of convolutional networks is to understand how the 	 depth of convolutional networks affects the accuracy and accuracy of large-scale image classification and recognition. -Deep-16 CNN), in order to deepen the number of network layers and to avoid too 	  	  many parameters, a small 3x3 convolution kernel is used in all layers.
