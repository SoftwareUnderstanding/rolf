      "excerpt": "This repo contains a trained esrGAN model (one using dense blocks and one using RRDB blocks described in the esrGAN paper), a trained srGAN model, and a trained esrGAN model, with versions for TF 2.3.0 (default version in Google Colab/Kaggle) and TF 2.2.0 (latest release for Anaconda). For fine-tuning your own model, there is an srGAN and esrGAN Jupyter notebook, and you input your low/high-res images in the /train directory. \nI also made a script (superResTest.py) to upscale any image 4x if the dimensions of the image is divisible by 32 (e.g 128x128 -> 512x512, 32x64 -> 128x256) \n",
