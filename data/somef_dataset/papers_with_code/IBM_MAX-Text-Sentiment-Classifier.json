The implementation in this repository was not trained or fine-tuned on the Sentiment140 or IMDB reviews datasets. \nThe second row describes the performance of the BERT-Base (English - Uncased) model when fine-tuned on the specific task. This was done simply for reference, and the weights are therefore not made available. \nThe generalization results (first row) are very good when the input data is similar to the data used for fine-tuning (e.g. Sentiment140 (tweets) when fine-tuned on the IBM Claims Dataset).

The json structure should have one key, `text`, with as value a list of input strings to be analyzed. An example can be found in the image below.\n\nSubmitting proper json data triggers the model and will return a json file with a `status` and a `predictions` key. With this `predictions` field, a list of class labels and their corresponding probabilities will be associated. The first element in the list corresponds to the prediction for the first string in the input list.\n\n\n![Swagger UI Screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)\n\nYou can also test it on the command line, for example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -d \"{ \\\"text\\\": [ \\\"The Model Asset Exchange is a crucial element of a developer's toolkit.\\\" ]}\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5000/model/predict\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response like that below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"predictions\": [\n    [\n      {\n        \"positive\": 0.9977352619171143,\n        \"negative\": 0.0022646968718618155\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n",
