      "excerpt": "Multiple Object Tracking, MOT, aims to track motion trajectories of multiple objects in a series of video frames. This task includes two aspects: object detection and data association. Specifically, for each frame, the first step is to detect interested objects, which are then used to track objects by data association.  \nSeveral approaches have been used to tackle MOT task, the following method is relatively mature for production: Backend tracking optimization algorithm based on Kalman Filter and Hungaraian (Kuhn-Munkres) algorithms, with SORT and DEEP-SORT as examples.  \nSORT, Simple Online and Realtime Tracking, uses a linear velocity model and Kalman Filter to detect and predict object locations. Hungarian algorithm then serves as a matching optimization algorithm by searching for the maximum matching of a bipartite graph. SORT uses IOU distance, Intersection Over Union distance, as weights to integrate the Hungarian algorithm for data association. SORT also adopts linear assignment implementation directly from sklearn. A threshold of 0.3 for IOU is selected in the original paper to determine whether or not two objects have the same identity. SORT assumes that objects do not move too much between any two frames. This assumption, together with occlusion issues, implies that SORT suffers from high Identity Switches. Its open-sourced version can be found here: https://github.com/abewley/sort. \n",
