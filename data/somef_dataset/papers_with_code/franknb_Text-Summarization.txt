# Text-Summarization

### Before anything: 

- **What is this?**

As described, a testing place for different text summarization tools.

- **What is the background?**

![workflow](workflow.png)
Here's a workflow I created for the complete task. Put it simple, we were asked to complete the task of generating automated summarzations from the Credera weekly updates videos. The videos are on Microsoft Stream, and ultimately we need to generate summarized texts for each video.

For now, we will be focusing on the 3rd part of the workflow, namely, the text summarization.

- **What are the notebooks about?**

They includes different approaches for text summarization. In the following part, I will give simple introductions of each methods.

1. **DistilBERT** from ***transformers***

- **What is DistilBERT?**: 

  - Distil here means (Knowledge) Distillation, just as the literal means, is a compression technique in which a small model is trained to reproduce the behavior of a larger model (or an ensemble of models). It was first introduced in (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/compression.kdd06.pdf), then generalized in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)

  - BERT here stands for ***Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers***, is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), a popular attention model, to language modelling. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training. The paperâ€™s results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language models.
