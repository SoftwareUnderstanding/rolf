      "excerpt": "Project Sketch-to-Shoe is a thorough yet comprehensible reimplementation of the pix2pix GAN paper (Isola et al.) which can be found here. It adheres to the PyTorch framework and is trained on various sketches/images of shoes. \nThe dataset, called Edges2Shoes has been obtained from here and has been boiled down to contain a total of 2,392 training images along with 200 validation images. To sum it all up, project sketch-to-shoe transforms outlines/sketches of any given footwear design to a realistic copy of the same. \nThe pix2pix GAN is used for image to image translation and project Sketch-to-Shoe makes use of the same to visualize realistic images of shoes from their respective edge maps(i.e. sketches) \nModel Architectures: \nThe discriminator's architecture follows that of a PatchGAN with NxN or 15x15 patches(for edges2shoes data) which runs over the images in order to classify each patch as real or fake. According to the paper, this approach (patchGAN) is smaller, has fewer parameters during training and runs faster with respect to large images. \nThe generator's architecture is similar to that of a U-net and consists of the encoder-decoder structure in which the encoder down-samples images to 1x1 dimensions whereas the decoder up-samples them back to their original size which is 256x256 in case of the edges2shoes dataset. \n",
