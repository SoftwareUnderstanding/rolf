      "excerpt": "Data augmentation is vital for deep learning neural networks. By providing massive training samples, it helps to \nimprove the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usually employ geometrical transformations, random cropping and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of \u201caeroplane\u201d may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself, but also its co-occurrence context like \u201csky\u201d, which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence between object instances and contextual information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with several alternative network architectures demonstrate that CDA can boost various popular WSSS methods to the new state-of-the-art by a large margin. \nThanks to the work of jiwoon-ahn, our work is mainly based on his IRNet respository. Besides, for clarity, we only provide the IRN augmentation code. You can use the same modifications for SEAM and AffinityNet. The model weights are given below. \n",
