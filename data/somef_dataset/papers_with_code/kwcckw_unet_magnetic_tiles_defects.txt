# Magnetic tiles blow hole defects segmentation using Unet

In this example, segmentation was done to identify the area of blow hole in the magnetic tiles using deep learning approach.

The dataset is available from:

https://github.com/abin24/Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets.

And the deep learning model UNet is adapted from:

https://github.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch

Original paper of UNet:
U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation (Ronneberger et al., 2015) https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597



The code was developed in Google Colab environment.
