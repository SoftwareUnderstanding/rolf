The data set comes from [Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3?fbclid=IwAR2-zVkhGrlEklqZv_gp05hp-vAJCi31BR0Ux8Zbus1Q_lrCXtwuNq-zRDg)

The main reference paper is [Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867418301545%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

The main.py, main01.py, and main02.py are training source codes.

The result of the Lime algorithm is shown in two lime.py files.

The visualization.py would show the output of 2 conv. layers and use the tSNE to visualize 3 fully connecting layers.
