      "excerpt": "A Bijector is a differentiable bijection with a differentiable inverse. That's basically it. \nThe primary application of Bijectors is the (very profitable) business of transforming (usually continuous) probability densities. If we transfrom a random variable x ~ p(x) to y = b(x) where b is a Bijector, we also get a canonical density q(y) = p(b\u207b\u00b9(y)) |det J(b\u207b\u00b9, y)| for y. Here J(b\u207b\u00b9, y) is the Jacobian of the inverse transform evaluated at y. q is also known as the push-forward of p by b in measure theory. \nThere's plenty of different reasons why one would want to do something like this. It can be because your p has non-zero probability (support) on a closed interval [a, b] and you want to use AD without having to worry about reaching the boundary. E.g. Beta has support [0, 1] so if we could transform p = Beta into a density q with support on \u211d, we could instead compute the derivative of logpdf(q, y) wrt. y, and then transform back x = b\u207b\u00b9(y). This is very useful for certain inference methods, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo, where we need to take the derivative of the logpdf-computation wrt. input. \nAnother use-case is constructing a parameterized Bijector and consider transforming a \"simple\" density, e.g. MvNormal, to match a more complex density. One class of such bijectors is Normalizing Flows (NFs) which are compositions of differentiable and invertible neural networks, i.e. composition of a particular family of parameterized bijectors.[1] We'll see an example of this later on. \n",

As a user, you'll rarely have to deal with this dimensionality specification. Unfortunately there are exceptions, e.g. Exp which can be applied to both real numbers and a vector of real numbers, in both cases treating it as a single input. This means that when Exp receives a vector input x as input, it's ambiguous whether or not to treat x as a batch of 0-dim inputs or as a single 1-dim input. As a result, to support batch-computation it is necessary to know the expected dimensionality of the input and output. Notice that we assume the dimensionality of the input and output to be the same. This is a reasonable assumption considering we're working with bijections. \n",

Consider for example the one from above with `Beta(2, 2)`.\n\n```julia\njulia> using Random; Random.seed!(42);\n\njulia> using Bijectors; using Bijectors: Logit\n\njulia> dist = Beta(2, 2)\nBeta{Float64}(\u03b1=2.0, \u03b2=2.0)\n\njulia> x = rand(dist)\n0.36888689965963756\n\njulia> b = bijector(dist) #: bijection (0, 1) \u2192 \u211d\nLogit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)\n\njulia> y = b(x)\n-0.5369949942509267\n```\n\nIn this case we see that `bijector(d::Distribution)` returns the corresponding constrained-to-unconstrained bijection for `Beta`, which indeed is a `Logit` with `a = 0.0` and `b = 1.0`. The resulting `Logit <: Bijector` has a method `(b::Logit)(x)` defined, allowing us to call it just like any other function. Comparing with the above example, `b(x) \u2248 link(dist, x)`. Just to convince ourselves:\n\n```julia\njulia> b(x) \u2248 link(dist, x)\ntrue\n```\n\n",

      "excerpt": "But the real utility of `TransformedDistribution` becomes more apparent when using `transformed(dist, b)` for any bijector `b`. To get the transformed distribution corresponding to the `Beta(2, 2)`, we called `transformed(dist)` before. This is simply an alias for `transformed(dist, bijector(dist))`. Remember `bijector(dist)` returns the constrained-to-constrained bijector for that particular `Distribution`. But we can of course construct a `TransformedDistribution` using different bijectors with the same `dist`. This is particularly useful in something called _Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI)_.[2] An important part of ADVI is to approximate a constrained distribution, e.g. `Beta`, as follows:\n1. Sample `x` from a `Normal` with parameters `\u03bc` and `\u03c3`, i.e. `x ~ Normal(\u03bc, \u03c3)`.\n2. Transform `x` to `y` s.t. `y \u2208 support(Beta)`, with the transform being a differentiable bijection with a differentiable inverse (a \"bijector\")\n\nThis then defines a probability density with same _support_ as `Beta`! Of course, it's unlikely that it will be the same density, but it's an _approximation_. Creating such a distribution becomes trivial with `Bijector` and `TransformedDistribution`:\n\n```julia\njulia> dist = Beta(2, 2)\nBeta{Float64}(\u03b1=2.0, \u03b2=2.0)\n\njulia> b = bijector(dist)              #: (0, 1) \u2192 \u211d\nLogit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)\n\njulia> b\u207b\u00b9 = inverse(b)                    #: \u211d \u2192 (0, 1)\nInverse{Logit{Float64},0}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0))\n\njulia> td = transformed(Normal(), b\u207b\u00b9) #: x \u223c \ud835\udcdd(0, 1) then b(x) \u2208 (0, 1)\nTransformedDistribution{Normal{Float64},Inverse{Logit{Float64},0},Univariate}(\ndist: Normal{Float64}(\u03bc=0.0, \u03c3=1.0)\ntransform: Inverse{Logit{Float64},0}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0))\n)\n\n\njulia> x = rand(td)                    #: \u2208 (0, 1)\n0.538956748141868\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that `support(Beta)` is the _closed_ interval `[0, 1]`, while the constrained-to-unconstrained bijection, `Logit` in this case, is only well-defined as a map `(0, 1) \u2192 \u211d` for the _open_ interval `(0, 1)`. This is of course not an implementation detail. `\u211d` is itself open, thus no continuous bijection exists from a _closed_ interval to `\u211d`. But since the boundaries of a closed interval has what's known as measure zero, this doesn't end up affecting the resulting density with support on the entire real line. In practice, this means that\n\n```julia\ntd = transformed(Beta())\n\ninverse(td.transform)(rand(td))\n```\n\nwill never result in `0` or `1` though any sample arbitrarily close to either `0` or `1` is possible. _Disclaimer: numerical accuracy is limited, so you might still see `0` and `1` if you're lucky._\n\n",
