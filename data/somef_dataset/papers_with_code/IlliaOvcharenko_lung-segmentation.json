Splits were saved into ```splits.pk```.\n\nThe main task is to implement pixel-wise segmentation on the available data to detect lung area.\nDownload link on the dataset https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffbbyoPf-I3Y0iGbBahXpWqYdGd7xxQQ/view.\n\n",

They are both showing almost the same things - overlap between ground truth and calculated mask.  \nThe main disadvantage is that they consider only the number of true positives, false positives and false negatives and ignore predicted location. So, more reasonable is to use average contour distance and average surface distance. These metrics are not implemented yet, more information about them you could find in \"Accurate Lung Segmentation via Network-WiseTraining of Convolutional Networks\" preprint, check out references list. \n",
