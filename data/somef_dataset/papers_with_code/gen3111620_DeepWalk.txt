# Implemented DeepWalk algorithm 


## Overview
```
The repo is a simple DeepWalk algorithm implementation.

you can input the networkx and get random walk path and use gensim to build word2vec skipgram model.

```

## Installation
```

pip install -r requirement  

```

## How to use

```

1. using networkx to create network architecture for yourself.

2. using DeepWalk module and call random_walk to build random walk records.

3. using DeepWalk module and call buildWord2Vec to build word2vec model.

```
