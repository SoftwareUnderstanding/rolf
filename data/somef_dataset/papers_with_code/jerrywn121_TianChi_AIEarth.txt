# TianChi AIEarth
This is the top 1 (Bæ¦œ) solution for the TianChi AIEarth Contest (https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531871/introduction?lang=zh-cn)

The three models are implemented in Pytorch for Nino prediction and currently support single-GPU training only.
Note that the model architecture of the SAConvLSTM and Conv-TT-LSTM are from the original papers, and we novelly modify the TimeSformer as STTransformer for spatio-temporal prediction.

## Dependencies
In general, several major packages are needed\
xarray==0.17.0\
netcdf4==1.5.6\
torch==1.7.1\
numpy==1.19.1
