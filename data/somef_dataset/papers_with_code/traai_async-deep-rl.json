      "excerpt": "A Tensorflow-based implementation of all algorithms presented in Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning. \nThis implementation uses processes instead of threads to achieve real concurrency. Each process has a local replica of the network(s) used, implemented in Tensorflow, and runs its own Tensorflow session. In addition, a copy of the network parameters are kept in a shared memory space. At runtime, each process uses its own local network(s) to choose actions and compute gradients (with Tensorflow). The shared network parameters are updated periodically in an asynchronous manner, by applying the grads obtained from Tensorflow into the shared memory space.  \n",

      "excerpt": "As you can see, the score achieved is much higher than the one reported in the paper. That is due to the effect of having 100 actors. So concurrently exploring the environment in different ways definitely helps with the learning process and makes experience replay not needed. Note, however, that the performance in terms of training time is slightly worse than with fewer actors. This is probably due to our implementation, which is not optimal, and to the limitations of the machine we used. \n",

Default values have been chosen according to the paper and [information](https://github.com/muupan/async-rl/wiki) received by @muupan from the authors. To see a list, please run:\n```\npython main.py -h\n```\n\nIf you just want to see the code in action, you can kick off training with the default hyperparameters by running:\n```\npython main.py pong --rom_path ../atari_roms/\n```\n\nTo run outside a docker, you need to install some dependencies:\n- Tensorflow\n- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation)\n- The Arcade Learning Environment ([ALE](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)).(Note that OpenAI Gym uses ALE internally, so you could use that version. This would require some hacking.)\n- Scikit-image\n- Open CV v2, for standalone ALE (It should be possible to change the code in `emulator.py` to use Scikit-image instead of CV2. Indeed, CV2 might slow things down)  \n\nTo run inside a docker:\n\n(1) Clone this repo at `~/some-path`.\n\n(2) Make sure your machine has docker installed. Follow instructions [here]\n(https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/) if not. [These] \n(https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instructions may work for Windows.\n\n(3) Make sure you have xquartz installed in order to visualise game play. \nDo the following in a separate terminal window:\n```\n$ brew cask install --force xquartz\n$ open -a XQuartz\n$ socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\\\"$DISPLAY\\\"\n```\n\n(4) Get our docker image containing all dependencies to run the algorithms and \nto visualise game play.\n```shell\n$ docker pull restrd/tensorflow-atari-cpu\n```\n\n(5) Run the docker image. This will mount your home folder to `/your-user-name` \ninside the container. Be sure to give a name to the container: \n`<container-name>`\n```shell\n$ docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --name \"<container-name>\" -v ~/:/root/$usr -e DISPLAY=$(ifconfig vboxnet0 | awk '$1 == \"inet\" {gsub(/\\/.*$/, \"\", $2); print $2}'):0 -it docker.io/restrd/tensorflow0.10-atari-cpu\n```\n\n(6) Shell into the container.\n```\n$ docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash\n```\n\n(7) Go to the algorithms folder \n(`/your-user-name/some-path/async-deep-rl/algorithms`) and choose which \nalgorithm to run via the configuration options in `main.py`.\n\n(8) If you want to run the algorithms using [Open AI GYM](https://gym.openai.com/) with 16 processes and visualize the games, e.g.:\n```shell\n$ python main.py BeamRider-v0 --env GYM -n 16 -v 1 \n```\n\n",
