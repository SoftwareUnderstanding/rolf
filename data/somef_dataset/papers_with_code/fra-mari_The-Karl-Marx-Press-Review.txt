### Concept
This website has been developed with Python and Flask to provide a visualisation of **a project on text generation with [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)**. Trained on 8 million webpages, GPT-2 was released in 2019 for generating high-quality short texts based on a few words provided as an initial input. 

For this project, I decided to **fine-tune the GPT-2**, that is to make it especially sensitive to a certain vocabulary or style, so as to reproduce those features while generating text. To achieve this goal and to better be able to assess its results, I first looked for **a corpus of texts featuring a very colourful, if homogenous, rhetoric** to retrain the GPT-2 on. My choice eventually fell on the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which I scraped from the website of the [Marx Engels Archive](https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/index.htm). Moreover, to observe the outcome of ‚ÄúMarxist‚Äù textual generation on a variety of topics, I thought it could be interesting to **provide inputs for the GPT-2 from a newspaper**. Hence the idea of this peculiar press review, which is updated with the latest news of [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com).

### Architecture
The model is fine-tuned by means of [aitextgen](https://docs.aitextgen.io/), a Python library developed by [Max Woolf](https://github.com/minimaxir). Aitextgen leverages PyTorch to retrain the 124 M version of GPT-2 using the dataset provided by the user. 

The webapp cyclically collects articles from _The Guardian_‚Äôs API and uses the language model to generate ‚ÄúMarxist comments‚Äù based on them. I also implemented some basic **sentiment analysis** on the generated comments using [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) (_Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner_). All these data are eventually stored in the SQL database.

The website also features a function for directly interacting with the model. The Marxist GPT-2 is not _always_ very intelligent, however it is pretty opinionated one, and it is always fun to talk to it! üòâ

### To Use This Code Locally
#### STEP 1: Generate the dataset and the model:

- Clone this repository
- Go to the folder `data_and_model`:
  - install the requirements with `pip install requirements.txt`;
  - run: `python scraper_preprocesser.py` **to download the dataset on which to fine-tune the GPT-2 model** (`marx.txt`). After running the process, you should see it in a new subfolder called `training_dataset/preprocessed`;
  - **To download and fine-tune the GPT-2 model**, load the Notebook `Text-Generating_GPT-2_Finetuner_on_Colab_GPU.ipynb` into your Google Drive, <u>open it with Google Colaboratory</u> and follow the instructions to create the two files `pytorch_model.bin` and `config.json`;
  - Paste these files into the two subfolders `trained_model` to be found in: `marxist_press_review/article_collector/` and `marxist_press_review/press_review_app/`.

#### STEP 2: Setting the required environment variables

In order for this webapp to work, you will need to set _two environment variables_:
1. The password for the PostgreSQL database which will be created. Unless you do not want to change its name in the `docker-compose.yml` file, this variable must be called `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`;
2. The API key for **The Guardian Open Platform**, which you can generate upon free registration via [this link](https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer).  Unless you do not want to change its name in the `docker-compose.yml` file, this variable must be called `GUARDIAN_API_KEY`.

#### STEP 3: Running the webapp with Docker

- Install Docker, then go into the folder `marxist_press_review`:
  - run `docker-compose build` and wait for Docker to set up everything for you;
  - run `docker-compose up` and wait for the log to confirm that the webapp has correctly started (something like `press_review_app_1   | 2021-08-16 15:38:21,336: INFO:  * Running on http://<ANY-ADDRESS-ENDING-BY-:5000/>`);
  - wait for another while, as the software downloads the most recent articles from _The Guardian_'s API to PostgreSQL (the log will confirm that your API key works correctly by printing lines such as: `2021-08-16 15:40:12,819: INFO: Successfully connected to https://content.guardianapis.com/search?section=world: scraping...`);
- open the address `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and the website should appear. 

Have fun talking with Karl Marx!
