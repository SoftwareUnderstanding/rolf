      "excerpt": "There is obviously imbalanced phenomenon in this data set : Some classes have only 2 or 3 examples, others have up to 10 examples. To solve this problem, I find classes which have less than 5 examples and do some random transformations : with classes which have 2 examples, 4 transformations were implemented, with classes which have 3 examples, 3 transformations were implemented and with classes which have 4 examples, 2 transformations were implemented. Therefor, all the classes basically have at least 6 example for training.  \nWith the limited number of data, the idea is to use a pretrained model for face recognition. After having done some research, I found a pretrained model called FaceNet that would be useful. The limitation of this model is that the data is not faces of asian people meanwhile our purpose is to recognize vietnamese celebrities. \n",

MTCNN showed very bad results : about 200 images in training set and 600 images in test set that can not be detected by MTCNN. This problem can be explained that many faces in this data were looking down or other ways, some others are in black and white. So I tried the face detector of mxnet with threshold = 0.2. The result was remarkable compared to MTCNN.  \n",
