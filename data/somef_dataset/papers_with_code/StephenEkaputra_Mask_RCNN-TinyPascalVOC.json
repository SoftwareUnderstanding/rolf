Somehow, we need validation data to train the model but \u2018test.json\u2019 has no image id and annotation key. So, we took only 10 training data which has annotation key as validation data to train faster and set the validation step in config.py to 1. Further, we fixed the \u2018pascal_train.json\u2019 format into coco annotation format (http://cocodataset.org/).
