Google's BERT achieved new state of art result on more than 10 tasks in NLP using pre-train in language model then 

fine-tuning. <a href='https://github.com/brightmart/bert_language_understanding'>Pre-train TexCNN: idea from BERT for language understanding with running code and data set</a>


#### Introduction
it has all kinds of baseline models for text classification.

it also support for multi-label classification where multi labels associate with an sentence or document.

although many of these models are simple, and may not get you to top level of the task. but some of these models are very 

classic, so they may be good to serve as baseline models. each model has a test function under model class. you can run 

it to performance toy task first. the model is independent from data set.

<a href='https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/multi-label-classification.pdf'>check here for formal report of large scale multi-label text classification with deep learning</a>

several models here can also be used for modelling question answering (with or without context), or to do sequences generating. 

we explore two seq2seq model(seq2seq with attention,transformer-attention is all you need) to do text classification. 

and these two models can also be used for sequences generating and other tasks. if your task is a multi-label classification, 

you can cast the problem to sequences generating.

we implement two memory network. one is dynamic memory network. previously it reached state of art in question 

answering, sentiment analysis and sequence generating tasks. it is so called one model to do several different tasks, 

and reach high performance. it has four modules. the key component is episodic memory module. it use gate mechanism to 

performance attention, and use gated-gru to update episode memory, then it has another gru( in a vertical direction) to 

performance hidden state update. it has ability to do transitive inference.

the second memory network we implemented is recurrent entity network: tracking state of the world. it has blocks of 

key-value pairs as memory, run in parallel, which achieve new state of art. it can be used for modelling question 

answering with contexts(or history). for example, you can let the model to read some sentences(as context), and ask a 

question(as query), then ask the model to predict an answer; if you feed story same as query, then it can do 

classification task.

12) Boosting: 

    for a single model, stack identical models together. each layer is a model. the result will be based on logits added together. the only connection between layers are label's weights. the front layer's prediction error rate of each label will become weight for the next layers. those labels with high error rate will have big weight. so later layer's will pay more attention to those mis-predicted labels, and try to fix previous mistake of former layer. as a result, we will get a much strong model.

       on the way, many of these papers list in the # Reference at the end of this article; or join  a machine learning 
       
       competition, and apply it with what you've learned. 
       
Use Your Own Data:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
replace data in 'data/sample_multiple_label.txt', and make sure format as below:

'word1 word2 word3 __label__l1 __label__l2 __label__l3'
 
where part1: 'word1 word2 word3' is input(X), part2: '__label__l1 __label__l2 __label__l3' 

representing there are three labels: [l1,l2,l3]. between part1 and part2 there should be a empty string: ' '.

for example: each line (multiple labels) like: 

'w5466 w138990 w1638 w4301 w6 w470 w202 c1834 c1400 c134 c57 c73 c699 c317 c184 __label__5626661657638885119 __label__4921793805334628695 __label__8904735555009151318'

Notice:


Some util function is in data_util.py;  check load_data_multilabel() of data_util for how process input and labels from raw data.

there is a function to load and assign pretrained word embedding to the model,where word embedding is pretrained in word2vec or fastText. 

Pretrain Work Embedding:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if word2vec.load not works, you may load pretrained word embedding, especially for chinese word embedding use following lines:

import gensim

from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

word2vec_model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(word2vec_model_path, binary=True, unicode_errors='ignore')  #

or you can turn off use pretrain word embedding flag to false to disable loading word embedding.


Models Detail:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.fastText:  
-------------
implmentation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759">Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification</a>

after embed each word in the sentence, this word representations are then averaged into a text representation, which is in turn fed to a linear classifier.it use softmax function to compute the probability distribution over the predefined classes. then cross entropy is used to compute loss. bag of word representation does not consider word order. in order to take account of word order, n-gram features is used to capture some partial information about the local word order; when the number of classes is large, computing the linear classifier is computational expensive. so it usehierarchical softmax to speed training process.
1) use bi-gram and/or tri-gram
2) use NCE loss to speed us softmax computation(not use hierarchy softmax as original paper)

result: performance is as good as paper, speed also very fast.

2.TextCNN:
-------------
Implementation of <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181"> Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification </a>

Structure:embedding--->conv--->max pooling--->fully connected layer-------->softmax

Check: p7_TextCNN_model.py

In order to get very good result with TextCNN, you also need to read carefully about this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820">A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification</a>: it give you some insights of things that can affect performance. although you need to  change some settings according to your specific task.

Convolutional Neural Network is main building box for solve problems of computer vision. Now we will show how CNN can be used for NLP, in in particular, text classification. Sentence length will be different from one to another. So we will use pad to get fixed length, n. For each token in the sentence, we will use word embedding to get a fixed dimension vector, d. So our input is a 2-dimension matrix:(n,d). This is similar with image for CNN. 

Firstly, we will do convolutional operation to our input. It is a element-wise multiply between filter and part of input. We use k number of filters, each filter size is a 2-dimension matrix (f,d). Now the output will be k number of lists. Each list has a length of n-f+1. each element is a scalar. Notice that the second dimension will be always the dimension of word embedding. We are using different size of filters to get rich features from text inputs. And this is something similar with n-gram features. 

Secondly, we will do max pooling for the output of convolutional operation. For k number of lists, we will get k number of scalars. 

Thirdly, we will concatenate scalars to form final features. It is a fixed-size vector. And it is independent from the size of filters we use.

Finally, we will use linear layer to project these features to per-defined labels.

3.BERT: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding 

BERT currently achieve state of art results on more than 10 NLP tasks. the key ideas behind this model is that we can 

pre-train the model by using one kind of language model with huge amount of raw data, where you can find it easily.

as most of parameters of the model is pre-trained, only last layer for classifier need to be need for different tasks.

as a result, this model is generic and very powerful. you can just fine-tuning based on the pre-trained model within
 
a short period of time.
 
however, this model is quite big. with sequence length 128, you may only able to train with a batch size of 32; for long

document such as sequence length 512, it can only train a batch size 4 for a normal GPU(with 11G); and very few people

can pre-train this model from scratch, as it takes many days or weeks to train, and a normal GPU's memory is too small 

for this model.

Specially, the backbone model is Transformer, where you can find it in Attention Is All You Need. it use two kind of 

tasks to pre-train the model.

#### Masked Languge Model
generally speaking, given a sentence, some percentage of words are masked, you will need to predict the masked words

based on this masked sentence. masked words are chosed randomly.

we feed the input through a deep Transformer encoder and then use the final hidden states corresponding to the masked 

positions to predict what word was masked, exactly like we would train a language model.

    source_file each line is a sequence of token, can be a sentence.
    
    Input Sequence  : The man went to [MASK] store with [MASK] dog
    Target Sequence :                  the                his
         

#### Next Sentence Prediction
many language understanding task, like question answering, inference, need understand relationship
  
between sentence. however, language model is only able to understand without a sentence. next sentence

prediction is a sample task to help model understand better in these kinds of task.

50% of chance the second sentence is tbe next sentence of the first one, 50% of not the next one.

given two sentence, the model is asked to predict whether the second sentence is real next sentence of 

the first one.
  
    Input : [CLS] the man went to the store [SEP] he bought a gallon of milk [SEP]
    Label : IsNext

    Input = [CLS] the man heading to the store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]
    Label = NotNext

<img src="https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/bert_2.jpeg"  width="65%" height="65%" />


#### How to use BERT?

basically, you can download pre-trained model, can just fine-tuning on your task with your own data.

for classification task, you can add processor to define the format you want to let input and labels from source data.

#### Use BERT for multi-label classification?

run the following command under folder a00_Bert:
 
      python  train_bert_multi-label.py
   
It achieve 0.368 after 9 epoch.
or you can run multi-label classification with downloadable data using BERT from 

<a href='https://github.com/brightmart/sentiment_analysis_fine_grain'>sentiment_analysis_fine_grain with BERT</a>
 
#### Use BERT for online prediction 

you can use session and feed style to restore model and feed data, then get logits to make a online prediction.

<a href='https://github.com/brightmart/sentiment_analysis_fine_grain'>online prediction with BERT</a>

originally, it train or evaluate model based on file, not for online.

#### How to get better model for BERT?

firstly, you can use pre-trained model download from google. run a few epoch on you dataset, and find a suitable 

sequence length.

secondly, you can pre-train the base model in your own data as long as  you can find a dataset that is related to 

your task, then fine-tuning on your specific task.

thirdly, you can change loss function and last layer to better suit for your task.

additionally, you can add define some pre-trained tasks that will help the model understand your task much better.

as experienced we got from experiments, pre-trained task is independent from model and pre-train is not limit to 

the tasks above.

9.Hierarchical Attention Network:
-------------
Implementation of <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf">Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification</a>

Structure:

1) embedding 

2) Word Encoder: word level bi-directional GRU to get rich representation of words

3) Word Attention:word level attention to get important information in a sentence

4) Sentence Encoder: sentence level bi-directional GRU to get rich representation of sentences

5) Sentence Attetion: sentence level attention to get important sentence among sentences

5) FC+Softmax

![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/HAN.JPG)

In NLP, text classification can be done for single sentence, but it can also be used for multiple sentences. we may call it document classification. Words are form to sentence. And sentence are form to document. In this circumstance, there may exists a intrinsic structure. So how can we model this kinds of task? Does all parts of document are equally relevant? And how we determine which part are more important than another?

It has two unique features: 

1)it has a hierarchical structure that reflect the hierarchical structure of documents; 

2)it has two levels of attention mechanisms used at the word and sentence-level. it enable the model to capture important information in different levels.

Word Encoder:
For each words in a sentence, it is embedded into word vector in distribution vector space. It use a bidirectional GRU to encode the sentence. By concatenate vector from two direction, it now can form a representation of the sentence, which also capture contextual information.

Word Attention:
Same words are more important than another for the sentence. So attention mechanism is used. It first use one layer MLP to get uit hidden representation of the sentence, then measure the importance of the word as the similarity of uit with a word level context vector uw and get a normalized importance through a softmax function. 

Sentence Encoder: 
for sentence vectors, bidirectional GRU is used to encode it. Similarly to word encoder.

Sentence Attention: 
sentence level vector is used to measure importance among sentences. Similarly to word attention.

Input of data: 

Generally speaking, input of this model should have serveral sentences instead of sinle sentence. shape is:[None,sentence_lenght]. where None means the batch_size.

In my training data, for each example, i have four parts. each part has same length. i concat four parts to form one single sentence. the model will split the sentence into four parts, to form a tensor with shape:[None,num_sentence,sentence_length]. where num_sentence is number of sentences(equal to 4, in my setting).

check:p1_HierarchicalAttention_model.py

for attentive attention you can check <a href='https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/issues/55'>attentive attention</a>

10.Seq2seq with attention
-------------
Implementation seq2seq with attention derived from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf">NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION BY JOINTLY LEARNING TO ALIGN AND TRANSLATE</a>

I.Structure:

1)embedding 2)bi-GRU too get rich representation from source sentences(forward & backward). 3)decoder with attention.

![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/seq2seqAttention.JPG)

II.Input of data:

there are two kinds of three kinds of inputs:1)encoder inputs, which is a sentence; 2)decoder inputs, it is labels list with fixed length;3)target labels, it is also a list of labels.

for example, labels is:"L1 L2 L3 L4", then decoder inputs will be:[_GO,L1,L2,L2,L3,_PAD]; target label will be:[L1,L2,L3,L3,_END,_PAD]. length is fixed to 6, any exceed labels will be trancated, will pad if label is not enough to fill.

III.Attention Mechanism:

1) transfer encoder input list and hidden state of decoder

2) calculate similarity of hidden state with each encoder input, to get possibility distribution for each encoder input.

3) weighted sum of encoder input based on possibility distribution.

   go though RNN Cell using this weight sum together with decoder input to get new hidden state

IV.How Vanilla Encoder Decoder Works:

the source sentence will be encoded using RNN as fixed size vector ("thought vector"). then during decoder:

1) when it is training, another RNN will be used to try to get a word by using this "thought vector"  as init state, and take input from decoder input at each timestamp. decoder start from special token "_GO". 
after one step is performanced, new hidden state will be get and together with new input, we can continue this process until we reach to a special token "_END". 
we can calculate loss by compute cross entropy loss of logits and target label. logits is get through a projection layer for the hidden state(for output of decoder step(in GRU we can just use hidden states from decoder as output).

2) when it is testing, there is no label. so we should feed the output we get from previous timestamp, and continue the process util we reached "_END" TOKEN.

V.Notices:

1) here i use two kinds of vocabularies. one is from words,used by encoder; another is for labels,used by decoder

2) for vocabulary of lables, i insert three special token:"_GO","_END","_PAD"; "_UNK" is not used, since all labels is pre-defined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.Transformer("Attention Is All You Need")
-------------
Status: it was able to do task classification. and able to generate reverse order of its sequences in toy task. you can check it by running test function in the model. check: a2_train_classification.py(train) or a2_transformer_classification.py(model)

we do it in parallell style.layer normalization,residual connection, and mask are also used in the model. 

For every building blocks, we include a test function in the each file below, and we've test each small piece successfully.

Sequence to sequence with attention is a typical model to solve sequence generation problem, such as translate, dialogue system. most of time, it use RNN as buidling block to do these tasks. util recently, people also apply convolutional Neural Network for sequence to sequence problem. Transformer, however, it perform these tasks solely on attention mechansim. it is fast and achieve new state-of-art result.

![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/attention_is_all_you_need.JPG)

It also has two main parts: encoder and decoder. below is desc from paper:

Encoder:

6 layers.each layers has two sub-layers.
the first is multi-head self-attention mechanism;
the second is position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
for each sublayer. use LayerNorm(x+Sublayer(x)). all dimension=512.

Decoder:

1. The decoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers.
2. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack.
3. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.  This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.

Main Take away from this model:

1) multi-head self attention: use self attention, linear transform multi-times to get projection of key-values, then do ordinary attention; 2) some tricks to improve performance(residual connection,position encoding, poistion feed forward, label smooth, mask to ignore things we want to ignore).

Use this model to do task classification:

Here we only use encode part for task classification, removed resdiual connection, used only 1 layer.no need to use mask. we use multi-head attention and postionwise feed forward to extract features of input sentence, then use linear layer to project it to get logits.

12.Recurrent Entity Network
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input:1. story: it is multi-sentences, as context. 2.query: a sentence, which is a question, 3. ansewr: a single label.

Model Structure:

1) Input encoding: use bag of word to encode story(context) and query(question); take account of position by using position mask

   by using bi-directional rnn to encode story and query, performance boost from 0.392 to 0.398, increase 1.5%.

2) Dynamic memory: 

a. compute gate by using 'similarity' of keys,values with input of story. 

b. get candidate hidden state by transform each key,value and input.

c. combine gate and candidate hidden state to update current hidden state.

3) Output moudle( use attention mechanism):
a. to get possibility distribution by computing 'similarity' of query and hidden state

b. get weighted sum of hidden state using possibility distribution.

c. non-linearity transform of query and hidden state to get predict label.

Main take away from this model:

1) use blocks of keys and values, which is independent from each other. so it can be run in parallel.

2) modelling context and question together. use memory to track state of world; and use non-linearity transform of hidden state and question(query) to make a prediction.

3) simple model can also achieve very good performance. simple encode as use bag of word.

for detail of the model, please check: a3_entity_network.py

under this model, it has a test function, which ask this model to count numbers both for story(context) and query(question). but weights of story is smaller than query.

13.Dynamic Memory Network
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outlook of Model:

1.Input Module: encode raw texts into vector representation

2.Question Module: encode question into vector representation

3.Episodic Memory Module: with inputs,it chooses which parts of inputs to focus on through the attention mechanism, taking into account of question and previous memory====>it poduce a 'memory' vecotr.

4.Answer Module:generate an answer from the final memory vector.

![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/DMN.JPG)

Detail:

1.Input Module:

  a.single sentence: use gru to get hidden state
  b.list of sentences: use gru to get the hidden states for each sentence. e.g. [hidden states 1,hidden states 2, hidden states...,hidden state n]
  
2.Question Module:
  use gru to get hidden state
  
3.Episodic Memory Module:

  use an attention mechanism and recurrent network to updates its memory. 
     
  a. gate as attention mechanism:
  
     two-layer feed forward nueral network.input is candidate fact c,previous memory m and question q. features get by take: element-wise,matmul and absolute distance of q with c, and q with m.
     
  b.memory update mechanism: take candidate sentence, gate and previous hidden state, it use gated-gru to update hidden state. like: h=f(c,h_previous,g). the final hidden state is the input for answer module.
  
  c.need for multiple episodes===>transitive inference. 
  
  e.g. ask where is the football? it will attend to sentence of "john put down the football"), then in second pass, it need to attend location of john.

4.Answer Module:
take the final epsoidic memory, question, it update hidden state of answer module.

Conclusion:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the process of doing large scale of multi-label classification, serveral lessons has been learned, and some list as below:

1) What is most important thing to reach a high accuracy? 
It depend the task you are doing. From the task we conducted here, we believe that ensemble models based on models trained from multiple features including word, character for title and description can help to reach very high accuarcy; However, in some cases,as just alphaGo Zero demonstrated, algorithm is more important then data or computational power, in fact alphaGo Zero did not use any humam data. 

2) Is there a ceiling for any specific model or algorithm?
The answer is yes. lots of different models were used here, we found many models have similar performances, even though there are quite different in structure. In some extent, the difference of performance is not so big.

3) Is case study of error useful?
I think it is quite useful especially when you have done many different things, but reached a limit. For example, by doing case study, you can find labels that models can make correct prediction, and where they make mistakes. And to imporove performance by  increasing weights of these wrong predicted labels or finding potential errors from data.

4) How can we become expert in a specific of Machine Learning?
In my opinion,join a machine learning competation or begin a task with lots of data, then read papers and implement some, is a good starting point. So we will have some really experience and ideas of handling specific task, and know the challenges of it.
But what's more important is that we should not only follow ideas from papers, but to explore some new ideas we think may help to slove the problem. For example, by changing structures of classic models or even invent some new structures, we may able to tackle the problem in a much better way as it may more suitable for task we are doing.
