# Cyclic Learning Rates and One Cycle Policy.
This notebook contains some of the experiments mentioned in papers [Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) and [A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 - learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820). My blog related to the same can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nachiket.tanksale/finding-good-learning-rate-and-the-one-cycle-policy-7159fe1db5d6)

This notebook works with:
1) Python 3.6+
2) Pytorch 0.3.x
