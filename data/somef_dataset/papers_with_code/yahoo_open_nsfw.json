      "excerpt": "We trained the model on the dataset with NSFW images as positive and SFW(suitable for work) images as negative. These images were editorially labelled. We cannot release the dataset or other details due to the nature of the data. \n\nWe use [CaffeOnSpark](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark) which is a wonderful framework for distributed learning that brings deep learning to Hadoop and Spark clusters for training models for our experiments. Big thanks to the CaffeOnSpark team!\n\nThe deep model was first pretrained on ImageNet 1000 class dataset. Then we finetuned the weights on the NSFW dataset.\nWe used the thin resnet 50 1by2 architecture as the pretrained network. The model was generated using [pynetbuilder](https://github.com/jay-mahadeokar/pynetbuilder) tool and replicates the [residual network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf) paper's 50 layer network (with half number of filters in each layer).  You can find more details on how the model was generated and trained [here](https://github.com/jay-mahadeokar/pynetbuilder/tree/master/models/imagenet)\n\nPlease note that deeper networks, or networks with more filters can improve accuracy. We train the model using a thin residual network architecture, since it provides good tradeoff in terms of accuracy, and the model is light-weight in terms of runtime (or flops) and memory (or number of parameters).\n\n",

      "excerpt": "This repo contains code for running Not Suitable for Work (NSFW) classification deep neural network Caffe models. Please refer our blog post which describes this work and experiments in more detail. \nDetecting offensive / adult images is an important problem which researchers have tackled for decades. With the evolution of computer vision and deep learning the algorithms have matured and we are now able to classify an image as not suitable for work with greater precision. \nDefining NSFW material is subjective and the task of identifying these images is non-trivial. Moreover, what may be objectionable in one context can be suitable in another. For this reason, the model we describe below focuses only on one type of NSFW content: pornographic images. The identification of NSFW sketches, cartoons, text, images of graphic violence, or other types of unsuitable content is not addressed with this model. \nSince images and user generated content dominate the internet today, filtering nudity and other not suitable for work images becomes an important problem. In this repository we opensource a Caffe deep neural network for preliminary filtering of NSFW images. \n",

Scores in middle range may be binned for different NSFW levels. \n* Depending on the dataset, usecase and types of images, we advise developers to choose suitable thresholds. Due to difficult nature of problem, there will be errors, which depend on use-cases / definition / tolerance of NSFW.  Ideally developers should create an evaluation set according to the definition of what is safe for their application, then fit a [ROC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) curve to choose a suitable threshold if they are using the model as it is. \n* ***Results can be improved by [fine-tuning](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/finetune_flickr_style.html)*** the model for your dataset/ use case / definition of NSFW. We do not provide any guarantees of accuracy of results. Please read the disclaimer below.\n* Using human moderation for edge cases in combination with the machine learned solution will help improve performance.\n\n",
