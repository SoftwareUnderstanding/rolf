The Android NDK is required to build the native (C/C++) TensorFlow code.\n        The current recommended version is 12b, which may be found\n        [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.html#ndk-12b-downloads).\n3. The Android SDK and build tools may be obtained\n        [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/build-tools.html),\n        or alternatively as part of\n        [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).
