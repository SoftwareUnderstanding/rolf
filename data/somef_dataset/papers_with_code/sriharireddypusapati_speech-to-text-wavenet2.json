      "excerpt": "A tensorflow implementation of speech recognition based on DeepMind's [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499). (Hereafter the Paper)\n\nAlthough [ibab](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) and [tomlepaine](https://github.com/tomlepaine/fast-wavenet) have already implemented WaveNet with tensorflow, they did not implement speech recognition. That's why we decided to implement it ourselves. \n\nSome of Deepmind's recent papers are tricky to reproduce. The Paper also omitted specific details about the implementation, and we had to fill the gaps in our own way.\n\nHere are a few important notes.\n\nFirst, while the Paper used the TIMIT dataset for the speech recognition experiment, we used the free VTCK dataset.\n\nSecond, the Paper added a mean-pooling layer after the dilated convolution layer for down-sampling. We extracted [MFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) from wav files and removed the final mean-pooling layer because the original setting was impossible to run on our TitanX GPU.\n\nThird, since the TIMIT dataset has phoneme labels, the Paper trained the model with two loss terms, phoneme classification and next phoneme prediction. We, instead, used a single CTC loss because VCTK provides sentence-level labels. As a result, we used only dilated conv1d layers without any dilated conv1d layers.\n\nFinally, we didn't do quantitative analyses such as BLEU score and post-processing by combining a language model due to the time constraints.\n\nThe final architecture is shown in the following figure.\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet/master/png/architecture.png\" width=\"1024\"/>\n</p>\n(Some images are cropped from [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499) and [Neural Machine Translation in Linear Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099))  \n\n\n",
