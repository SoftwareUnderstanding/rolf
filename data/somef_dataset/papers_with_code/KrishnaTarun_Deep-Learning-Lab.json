To gain an in-depth understanding we first focus on a basic implementation of a MLP in numpy and Pytorch. Apart from that we also learn to implement custom operations in PyTorch by re-implementing a batch-normalization layer.  \n",

In the first part of the assignment we experiment on a simple palindrome task. By comparing the perfomnace of Vanilla RNN with LSTMs as the LSTM is more capable of learning long-term dependencies than the vanilla RNN. In the second part of the assignment (Part3) we use LSTMs as Genrative model to predict the next character in the the sentence. \n",
