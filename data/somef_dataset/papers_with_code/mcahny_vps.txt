## Disclaimer
This repo is tested under Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.4, Cuda 10.0, and mmcv==0.2.14.

## Installation
a. This repo is built based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) commit hash `4357697`. Our modifications for VPSNet implementation are listed [here](mmdet/readme.txt). Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) to install the library.
You can use following commands to create conda env with related dependencies.
```
conda create -n vps python=3.7 -y
conda activate vps
conda install pytorch=1.4 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI"
pip install "git+https://github.com/cocodataset/panopticapi.git"
pip install -v -e . 
```
b. You also need to install dependencies for [Flownet2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch) and [UPSNet](https://github.com/uber-research/UPSNet) modules. 
```
bash ./init_flownet.sh
bash ./init_upsnet.sh
```

c. You may also need to download some pretrained weights.
```
pip install gdown
bash ./download_weights.sh
```

## Dataset
You can [download Cityscapes-VPS here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ecem4kq0fdkver4/cityscapes-vps-dataset-1.0.zip?dl=0). It provides 2500-frame panoptic labels that temporally extend the 500 Cityscapes image-panoptic labels. There are total 3000-frame panoptic labels which correspond to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30th frames of each 500 videos, where all instance ids are associated over time.

It not only supports video panoptic segmentation (VPS) task, but also provides super-set annotations for video semantic segmentation (VSS) and video instance segmentation (VIS) tasks. 

Necessary data for Cityscapes-VPS training, testing, and evaluation are as follows.
Please refer to [DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md) for dataset preparation.

VIPER dataset is provided by ["Playing for Benchmarks, ICCV 2017"](https://playing-for-benchmarks.org/). We use the 'day' split of the dataset by converting it into the video panoptic segmentation format. The converted dataset is provided upon [request](mcahny@kaist.ac.kr).

## Testing
Our trained models are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KcHYnghbs2KC6hQc7QVkPkEiJMrLr73s). Rename it to `latest.pth` and run the following commands to test the model on Cityscapes-VPS.

* FuseTrack model for Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ) on Cityscapes-VPS `val` set (`vpq-λ.txt` will be saved.)
```
python tools/test_vpq.py configs/cityscapes/fusetrack.py \
  work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/latest.pth \
  --out work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/val.pkl \
  --pan_im_json_file data/cityscapes_vps/panoptic_im_val_city_vps.json \
  --n_video 50 --mode val \
python tools/eval_vpq.py \
  --submit_dir work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/val_pans_unified/ \
  --truth_dir data/cityscapes_vps/val/panoptic_video/ \
  --pan_gt_json_file data/cityscapes_vps/panoptic_gt_val_city_vps.json
```
* FuseTrack model VPS inference on Cityscapes-VPS `test` set
```
python tools/test_vpq.py configs/cityscapes/fusetrack.py \
  work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/latest.pth \
  --out work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/test.pkl \
  --pan_im_json_file data/cityscapes_vps/panoptic_im_test_city_vps.json \
  --n_video 50 --mode test \
```
Files containing the predicted results will be generated as `pred.json` and `pan_pred/*.png` at  `work_dirs/cityscapes_vps/fusetrack_vpct/test_pans_unified/`. 

Cityscapes-VPS `test` split currently only allows evaluation on the codalab server. Please upload `submission.zip` to <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26183">Codalab server</a> to see actual performances.

## Training
* Train FuseTrack model on video-level Cityscapes-VPS. We start from [initial weights](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t69I1u0QKl-N4eciYv3UYXFOQSYb25cD) of image panoptic segmentation (IPS) model, pretrained on the original Cityscapes. Place it at `work_dirs/cityscapes/fuse_vpct/` and rename to `latest.pth` and run the following command.
```
# Multi-GPU distributed training
bash ./tools/dist_train.sh configs/cityscapes/fusetrack.py ${GPU_NUM}
# OR
python ./tools/train.py configs/cityscapes/fusetrack.py --gpus ${GPU_NUM}
```
