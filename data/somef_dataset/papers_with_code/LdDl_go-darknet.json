Do not forget provide proper CUDA and cuDNN versions.\n\n\n",

Please refer to the code on how to use this Go package.\n\nBuilding and running program:\n\n* Navigate to [example] folder\n    ```shell\n    cd $GOPATH/github.com/LdDl/go-darknet/example/base_example\n    ```\n\n* Download dataset (sample of image, coco.names, yolov4.cfg (or v3), yolov4.weights(or v3)).\n    ```shell\n    #:for yolo v4\n    ./download_data.sh\n    #:for yolo v3\n    ./download_data_v3.sh\n    ```\n* Note: you don't need *coco.data* file anymore, because sh-script above does insert *coco.names* into 'names' field in *yolov4.cfg* file (so AlexeyAB's fork can deal with it properly)\n    So last rows in yolov4.cfg file will look like:\n    ```bash\n    ......\n    [yolo]\n    .....\n    iou_loss=ciou\n    nms_kind=greedynms\n    beta_nms=0.6\n\n    names = coco.names #: this is path to coco.names file\n    ```\n\n* Also do not forget change batch and subdivisions sizes from:\n    ```shell\n    batch=64\n    subdivisions=8\n    ```\n    to\n    ```shell\n    batch=1\n    subdivisions=1\n    ```\n    It will reduce amount of VRAM used for detector test.\n\n\n* Build and run program\n    Yolo V4:\n    ```shell\n    go build main.go && ./main --configFile=yolov4.cfg --weightsFile=yolov4.weights --imageFile=sample.jpg\n    ```\n\n    Output should be something like this:\n    ```shell\n    traffic light (9): 73.5039% | start point: (238,73) | end point: (251, 106)\n    truck (7): 96.6401% | start point: (95,79) | end point: (233, 287)\n    truck (7): 96.4774% | start point: (662,158) | end point: (800, 321)\n    truck (7): 96.1841% | start point: (0,77) | end point: (86, 333)\n    truck (7): 46.8695% | start point: (434,173) | end point: (559, 216)\n    car (2): 99.7370% | start point: (512,188) | end point: (741, 329)\n    car (2): 99.2533% | start point: (260,191) | end point: (422, 322)\n    car (2): 99.0333% | start point: (425,201) | end point: (547, 309)\n    car (2): 83.3919% | start point: (386,210) | end point: (437, 287)\n    car (2): 75.8621% | start point: (73,199) | end point: (102, 274)\n    car (2): 39.1925% | start point: (386,206) | end point: (442, 240)\n    bicycle (1): 76.3121% | start point: (189,298) | end point: (253, 402)\n    person (0): 97.7213% | start point: (141,129) | end point: (283, 362)\n    ```\n\n    Yolo V3:\n    ```\n    go build main.go && ./main --configFile=yolov3.cfg --weightsFile=yolov3.weights --imageFile=sample.jpg\n    ```\n\n    Output should be something like this:\n    ```shell\n    truck (7): 49.5197% | start point: (0,136) | end point: (85, 311)\n    car (2): 36.3747% | start point: (95,152) | end point: (186, 283)\n    truck (7): 48.4384% | start point: (95,152) | end point: (186, 283)\n    truck (7): 45.6590% | start point: (694,178) | end point: (798, 310)\n    car (2): 76.8379% | start point: (1,145) | end point: (84, 324)\n    truck (7): 25.5731% | start point: (107,89) | end point: (215, 263)\n    car (2): 99.8783% | start point: (511,185) | end point: (748, 328)\n    car (2): 99.8194% | start point: (261,189) | end point: (427, 322)\n    car (2): 99.6408% | start point: (426,197) | end point: (539, 311)\n    car (2): 74.5610% | start point: (692,186) | end point: (796, 316)\n    car (2): 72.8053% | start point: (388,206) | end point: (437, 276)\n    bicycle (1): 72.2932% | start point: (178,270) | end point: (268, 406)\n    person (0): 97.3026% | start point: (143,135) | end point: (268, 343)\n    ```\n\n",
