      "excerpt": "A generic Mixture Density Networks implementation for distribution and uncertainty estimation by using Keras (TensorFlow) \nThis repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks intended to solve a lot of problems in which we want to predict a probability distribution by using Mixture Density Network avoiding a NaN problem and other derived problems of the model proposed by Bishop, C. M. (1994). The second major objective of this repository is to look for ways to predict uncertainty by using artificial neural networks. \nThe whole code, until 20.1.2017, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence supervised by Jordi Vitri\u00e0, PhD. The Master's Thesis report is published in this repository in a PDF format but my idea is to realize a web view of the final master's work in the coming days. To summary all the contents I explained in the report, it is possible to consult the slides of the presentation. Any contribution or idea to continue the lines of the proposed work will be very welcome. \n",
