      "excerpt": "This is an implementation of \"UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation\" in Python and powered by the Keras deep learning framework (Tensorflow as backend). For the first time, a new architecture, called UNet++ (nested U-Net architecture), is proposed for a more precise segmentation. We introduced the intermediate layers to U-Nets, which naturally form multiple new up-sampling expanding paths of different depths, resulting in an ensemble of U-Nets with a partially shared contracting path. \n",
