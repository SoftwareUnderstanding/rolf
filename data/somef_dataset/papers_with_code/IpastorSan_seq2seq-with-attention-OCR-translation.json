The attention layer implementation comes from this Tensorflow tutorial \nYou will find a preprocessing script that is useful for preparing the data to feed into the model. The data comes from the sentence pairs of the Tatoeba project available here: Manythings \nPreprocessing of Chinese text has some added difficulties, thats why I use Jieba to help with word-level tokenization and HanziConv to transform all the dataset into Traditional Chinese \nFinally, the OCR (pretrained Tesseract) script is designed to put everything together, recover the pre-trained language model  \n(note that I don't provide the weights as they are quite heavy, but I can send them over upon request), transform an image into a string and pre process it in such a way that the model can interpret it. \n",
