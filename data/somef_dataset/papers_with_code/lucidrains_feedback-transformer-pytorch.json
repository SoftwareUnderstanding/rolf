      "https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09402\">Feedback Transformer</a> in Pytorch. They improve on Transformer-XL by having each token have access to the representations of all previous layers through time. This is achieved by aggregating the outputs of all layers into a shared memory, which each token across layers can attend to at each time step.\n\nThe main drawback is longer training time, due to its non-parallel nature. But I thought I'd build it to further exploration and research into this line of work.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdb8MM94A5c\">Yannic Kilcher video</a>\n\nI also took the liberty to add some various enhancements, including pre-normalization, GLU gated feedforwards, as well as simplified T5 relative positional embeddings.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ pip install feedback-transformer-pytorch\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom feedback_transformer_pytorch import FeedbackTransformer\n\nmodel = FeedbackTransformer(\n    num_tokens = 20000,           # number of tokens\n    dim = 512,                    # dimension\n    depth = 6,                    # depth\n    seq_len = 2,                  # the sequence length of each segment or window\n    mem_len = 256,                # length of the memory buffer\n    dim_head = 64,                # dimension of each head\n    heads = 8,                    # number of heads\n    attn_dropout = 0.1,           # attention dropout\n    ff_dropout = 0.1              # feedforward dropout\n"
