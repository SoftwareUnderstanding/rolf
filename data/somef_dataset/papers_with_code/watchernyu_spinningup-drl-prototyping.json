      "excerpt": "Some **mac** users will run into gcc error. Typically it will first tell you to install gcc with brew. From past experience, it seems `gcc-6` works, so first try install with brew with the command `brew install gcc@6`, if you don't have brew, you will need to first install brew. If your brew is not installing things correctly, then you might try uninstall your brew and then reinstall brew, and then try `brew install gcc@6` again. After this step, you should have `gcc-6` now, but things might still not work, because your `gcc` command is mapped to the wrong gcc version. Check your gcc version wtih the command: `gcc --version`, gcc-6 is the version that works. gcc-4 and gcc-7 seem to fail (not sure why gcc 7 works on linux but fails on mac??). Likely you will see sth that is not gcc-6, so now you want to change your default gcc. This can be done with the command:\n\n```\ncd /usr/local/bin\nrm gcc\nln -s gcc-6 gcc\n```\n\nEssentially you create a symbolic link so that your `gcc` points to `gcc-6`. If you are interested, here is a tutorial on how symbolic link works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-edTHKZdkjo start from 4:25. \n\n",

Except that you need the linux mujoco files. You can install filezilla: https://filezilla-project.org/ and use it to transfer files between your machine and the hpc. To connect to the hpc via Filezilla, open the site manager (its icon is typically at the top left corner of the window), add a new site: set Host = `hpc.shanghai.nyu.edu`, port = `22`, protocol: `SFTP`, Logon Type:`Normal`, and enter your NYU credentials. Later on you can also add bookmarks so that you can easily go to certain commonly-used locations on the hpc. You can also use quickconnect. \n\nAfter you installed everything, use this command to start an interactive shell on a non-login node: \n`srun -p aquila --pty --mem  5000 -t 0-01:00 bash`, now you will be in one of the non-login nodes, these nodes don't have internet connection so you cannot download stuff, but you can perform test here, now use `source deactive` to deactivate your virtual environment, then you can active your environment, and then perform the tests (import mujoco, run sac etc.) here. \n\nNote: if you are submitting jobs using sbatch, make sure you deactivate your environment, or simply log out and log in again before submitting the job. \n\nFor a list of common commands, check `commonly_used_hpc_commands.txt`.\n\n",

For example, if you are on mac, click `mujoco200 macos`. We need to put these files to the correct location so that the python package `mujoco-py` can work, and then we can use those environments in `gym`. You will also need a license, ask your TA for the license. The instructions are given on this page `https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py`, basically, if you use linux or mac, (copy-pasted from that page), Unzip the downloaded `mujoco200` directory into `~/.mujoco/mujoco200`, and place your license key (the `mjkey.txt` or `authorized_keys`) in the folder `~/.mujoco/`.

      "excerpt": "The SAC and SAC adaptive implementation can be found under `spinup/algos/sac_pytorch/`\n\nRun experiments with pytorch sac: \n\nIn the sac_pytorch folder, run the SAC code with `python sac_pytorch`\n\nNote: currently there is no parallel running for SAC (also not supported by spinup), so you should always set number of cpu to 1 when you use experiment grid.\n\nThe program structure, though in Pytorch has been made to be as close to spinup tensorflow code as possible so readers who are familiar with other algorithm code in spinup will find this one easier to work with. I also referenced rlkit's SAC pytorch implementation, especially for the policy and value models part, but did a lot of simplification. \n\nConsult Spinup documentation for output and plotting:\n\nhttps://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/saving_and_loading.html\n\nhttps://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/plotting.html\n\nFeatures of original spinup are mostly supported. In addition, we have some new features:\n\n`sample_hpc_scripts` folder contains sample scripts that you can use to run parallel job arrays on the hpc. \n\n`sample_plot_helper` contains a short sample program that can help you do plotting in a more automatic way. The program can be tested to plot the data in `sample_data`. \n\n`sample_quick_test_job_array_grid.py` and `sample_quick_test_job_array_script.sh` are similar but run very quick jobs that are good for testing your environment setup. \n\nAfter you get the results (by default they show up in a folder called data), you can then use `python -m spinup.run plot <your data folder name>`. For example, if your folder name is \"sac\", then you should do `python -m spinup.run plot sac/`, make sure the name has that slash and it's not `python -m spinup.run plot sac`. \n\n",
