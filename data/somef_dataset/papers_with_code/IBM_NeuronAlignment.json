We propose a more general framework to  \ninvestigate the effect of symmetry on landscape connectivity by accounting for the weight permutations of the networks  \nbeing connected. To approximate the optimal permutation, we introduce an inexpensive heuristic referred to as neuron  \nalignment. Neuron alignment promotes similarity between the distribution of intermediate activations of models along the \ncurve. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the benefit of alignment to mode connectivity based on this simple  \nheuristic. We empirically verify that the permutation given by alignment is locally optimal via a proximal alternating  \nminimization scheme. Empirically, optimizing the weight permutation is critical for efficiently learning a simple,  \nplanar, low-loss curve between networks that successfully generalizes. Our alignment method can significantly alleviate  \n",
