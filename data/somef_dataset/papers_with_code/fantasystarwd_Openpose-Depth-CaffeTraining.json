    "excerpt": "Contributing\nIssues\nSpecific Caffe design and development issues, bugs, and feature requests are maintained by GitHub Issues.\nPlease do not post usage, installation, or modeling questions, or other requests for help to Issues.\nUse the caffe-users list instead. This helps developers maintain a clear, uncluttered, and efficient view of the state of Caffe.\nWhen reporting a bug, it's most helpful to provide the following information, where applicable:\n\nWhat steps reproduce the bug?\nCan you reproduce the bug using the latest master, compiled with the DEBUG make option?\nWhat hardware and operating system/distribution are you running?\nIf the bug is a crash, provide the backtrace (usually printed by Caffe; always obtainable with gdb).\n\nTry to give your issue a title that is succinct and specific. The devs will rename issues as needed to keep track of them.\nPull Requests\nCaffe welcomes all contributions.\nSee the contributing guide for details.\nBriefly: read commit by commit, a PR should tell a clean, compelling story of one improvement to Caffe. In particular:\n\nA PR should do one clear thing that obviously improves Caffe, and nothing more. Making many smaller PRs is better than making one large PR; review effort is superlinear in the amount of code involved.\nSimilarly, each commit should be a small, atomic change representing one step in development. PRs should be made of many commits where appropriate.\nPlease do rewrite PR history to be clean rather than chronological. Within-PR bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc. should be squashed and should not appear in merged PR history.\nAnything nonobvious from the code should be explained in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.",
