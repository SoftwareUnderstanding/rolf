      "excerpt": "ViDT is an end-to-end fully transformer-based object detector, which directly produces predictions without using convolutional layers. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: \nViDT introduces a modified attention mechanism, named Reconfigured Attention Module (RAM), that facilitates any ViT variant to handling the appened [DET] and [PATCH] tokens for a standalone object detection. Thus, we can modify the lastest Swin Transformer backbone with RAM to be an object detector and obtain high scalability using its local attetention mechanism with linear complexity. \nViDT adopts a lightweight encoder-free neck architecture to reduce the computational overhead while still enabling the additional optimization techniques on the neck module. As a result, ViDT obtains better performance than neck-free counterparts. \nWe introdcue a new concept of token matching for knowledge distillation, which brings additional performance gains from a large model to a small model without compromising detection efficiency. \nArchitectural Advantages. First, ViDT enables to combine Swin Transformer and the sequent-to-sequence paradigm for detection. Second, ViDT can use the multi-scale features and additional techniques without a significant computation overhead. Therefore, as a fully transformer-based object detector, ViDT facilitates better integration of vision and detection transformers.  \nComponent Summary. There are four components: (1) RAM to extend Swin Transformer as a standalone object detector, (2) the neck decoder to exploit multi-scale features  with two additional techniques, auxiliary decoding loss and iterative box refinement, (3) knowledge distillation to benefit from a large model, and (4) decoding layer drop to further accelerate inference speed. \n",
