# Unsupervised Learning Engines
This repo has several customized or proposed unsupervised learning algorithms, most of which focuses on neural network.

Deep embedding clustering model is based on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335 and is customized to take advantage of current keras packages.

Wasserstein GAN is build based on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875, implemented in keras
