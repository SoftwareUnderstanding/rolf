# U-Net Implementation

This implementation of U-Net (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) is a supplement to my specialization project in Industrial Mathematics at NTNU, concerning deep learning for cardiac MRI-image segmentation. A big thanks to hlamba28 (https://github.com/hlamba28/UNET-TGS) for a great example implementation of the U-Net and JakobGM for the IoU-implementation as well as fantastic support.
