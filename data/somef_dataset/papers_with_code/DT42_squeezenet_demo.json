    "excerpt": "b\"# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\\n\\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\\n\\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and\\nother kinds of works.\\n\\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take\\naway your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General\\nPublic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all\\nversions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\\nWe, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most\\nof our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\\nauthors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\\n\\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you\\nreceive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\\nsoftware or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\\nthese things.\\n\\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights\\nor asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain\\nresponsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:\\nresponsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\n\\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\\na fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.\\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\\nmust show them these terms so they know their rights.\\n\\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\n\\n  1. assert copyright on the software, and\\n  2. offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute\\n     and/or modify it.\\n\\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that\\nthere is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake,\\nthe GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their\\nproblems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\\n\\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\\nversions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This\\nis fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to\\nchange the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of\\nproducts for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most\\nunacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit\\nthe practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other\\ndomains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\\nversions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\n\\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States\\nshould not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on\\ngeneral-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special\\ndanger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively\\nproprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to\\nrender the program non-free.\\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\\nfollow.\\n\\n## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n### 0. Definitions.\\n\\nThis License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\\n\\nCopyright also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,\\nsuch as semiconductor masks.\\n\\nThe Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\\nEach licensee is addressed as you. Licensees and recipients may be\\nindividuals or organizations.\\n\\nTo modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a\\nfashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.\\nThe resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work\\nbased on the earlier work.\\n\\nA covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\\nProgram.\\n\\nTo propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,\\nwould make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable\\ncopyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.\\nPropagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\\nmaking available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\\n\\nTo convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to\\nmake or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\\nnetwork, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\\n\\nAn interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices to the\\nextent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that\\n\\n  1. displays an appropriate copyright notice, and\\n  2. tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\\n     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work\\n     under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\\n\\nIf the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a\\nprominent item in the list meets this criterion.\\n\\n### 1. Source Code.\\n\\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\\nmodifications to it. Object code means any non-source form of a work.\\n\\nA Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official standard\\ndefined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified\\nfor a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\\nworking in that language.\\n\\nThe System Libraries of an executable work include anything, other than the\\nwork as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\\nComponent, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only\\nto enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\\nInterface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code\\nform. A Major Component, in this context, means a major essential component\\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on\\nwhich the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an\\nobject code interpreter used to run it.\\n\\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the source\\ncode needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\\ncode and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.\\nHowever, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose\\ntools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in\\nperforming those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,\\nCorresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source\\nfiles for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as\\nby intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and\\nother parts of the work.\\n\\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\\nautomatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\\n\\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\\n\\n### 2. Basic Permissions.\\n\\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on\\nthe Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This\\nLicense explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\\nProgram. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only\\nif the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License\\nacknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by\\ncopyright law.\\n\\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\\nconditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\\ncovered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\\nexclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\\nprovided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all\\nmaterial for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running\\nthe covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your\\ndirection and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\\n\\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it\\nunnecessary.\\n\\n### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\\n\\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\\nunder any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\\ncopyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\\nrestricting circumvention of such measures.\\n\\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is\\neffected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\\nwork, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the\\nwork as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'\\nlegal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\\n\\n### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\\n\\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,\\nin any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on\\neach copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that\\nthis License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply\\nto the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give\\nall recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\\n\\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may\\noffer support or warranty protection for a fee.\\n\\n### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\\n\\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it\\nfrom the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,\\nprovided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\n  - a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and\\n    giving a relevant date.\\n  - b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\\n    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement\\n    modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices.\\n  - c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\\n    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore\\n    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole\\n    of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This\\n    License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it\\n    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\\n  - d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need\\n    not make them do so.\\n\\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,\\nwhich are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not\\ncombined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a\\nstorage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the compilation and\\nits resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the\\ncompilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a\\ncovered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\\nparts of the aggregate.\\n\\n### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\\n\\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4\\nand 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source\\nunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\\n\\n  - a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\\n    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source\\n    fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software\\n    interchange.\\n  - b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\\n    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for\\n    at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or\\n    customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the\\n    object code either\\n    1. a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\\n       that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\\n       customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\\n       reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or\\n    2. access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\\n       charge.\\n  - c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\\n    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\\n    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code\\n    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\\n  - d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\\n    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding\\n    Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You\\n    need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the\\n    object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the\\n    Corresponding Source may be on a different server operated by you or a\\n    third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you\\n    maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding\\n    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as\\n    needed to satisfy these requirements.\\n  - e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\\n    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the\\n    work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection\\n    6d.\\n\\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\\nCorresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\\nobject code work.\\n\\nA User Product is either\\n\\n  1. a consumer product, which means any tangible personal property which is\\n     normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or\\n  2. anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.\\n\\nIn determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be\\nresolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\\nparticular user, normally used refers to a typical or common use of that\\nclass of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,\\nthe product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product\\nhas substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\\nrepresent the only significant mode of use of the product.\\n\\nInstallation Information for a User Product means any methods, procedures,\\nauthorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\\nmodified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified\\nversion of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure\\nthat the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case\\nprevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\\n\\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a\\ntransaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is\\ntransferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of\\nhow the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under\\nthis section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this\\nrequirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the\\nability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the\\nwork has been installed in ROM).\\n\\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a\\nwork that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\\nProduct in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be\\ndenied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\\noperation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\\nacross the network.\\n\\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord\\nwith this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\\nimplementation available to the public in source code form), and must require\\nno special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\\n\\n### 7. Additional Terms.\\n\\nAdditional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by\\nmaking exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions\\nthat are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were\\nincluded in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\\nlaw. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may\\nbe used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\\ngoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\\n\\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\\nadditional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\\npermissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when\\nyou modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added\\nby you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\\npermission.\\n\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\\ncovered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\\nsupplement the terms of this License with terms:\\n\\n  - a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\\n    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\\n  - b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\\n    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed\\n    by works containing it; or\\n  - c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable\\n    ways as different from the original version; or\\n  - d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors\\n    of the material; or\\n  - e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\\n    names, trademarks, or service marks; or\\n  - f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by\\n    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\\n    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability\\n    that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and\\n    authors.\\n\\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions\\nwithin the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any\\npart of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along\\nwith a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\\nlicense document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\\nconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed\\nby the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction\\ndoes not survive such relicensing or conveying.\\n\\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,\\nin the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to\\nthose files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\\n\\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\\nseparately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\\napply either way.\\n\\n### 8. Termination.\\n\\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided\\nunder this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,\\nand will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any\\npatent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\\n\\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\\nparticular copyright holder is reinstated\\n\\n  - a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\\n    finally terminates your license, and\\n  - b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the\\n    violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\\n\\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation\\nof this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\\nviolation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\\n\\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\\nof parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\\nyour rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\\nqualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\\n\\n### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\\n\\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\\nof the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a\\nconsequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does\\nnot require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you\\npermission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\\ncopyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\\npropagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\\nso.\\n\\n### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\\n\\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a\\nlicense from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,\\nsubject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\\nthird parties with this License.\\n\\nAn entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an\\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\\nresults from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives\\na copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's\\npredecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a\\nright to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\\npredecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with\\nreasonable efforts.\\n\\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\\ngranted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a\\nlicense fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this\\nLicense, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or\\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\\nmaking, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any\\nportion of it.\\n\\n### 11. Patents.\\n\\nA contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of\\nthe Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is\\ncalled the contributor's contributor version.\\n\\nA contributor's essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or\\ncontrolled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\\nthat would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\\nusing, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\\nbe infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\\nversion. For purposes of this definition, control includes the right to grant\\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\\nLicense.\\n\\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\\nlicense under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,\\noffer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of\\nits contributor version.\\n\\nIn the following three paragraphs, a patent license is any express agreement\\nor commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express\\npermission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\\ninfringement). To grant such a patent license to a party means to make such\\nan agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\\n\\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\\nCorresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of\\ncharge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available\\nnetwork server or other readily accessible means, then you must either\\n\\n  1. cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or\\n  2. arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this\\n     particular work, or\\n  3. arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to\\n     extend the patent license to downstream recipients.\\n\\nKnowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent\\nlicense, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use\\nof the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\\npatents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\\n\\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\\nconvey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a\\npatent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing\\nthem to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\\nthen the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients\\nof the covered work and works based on it.\\n\\nA patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of\\nits coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\\nof one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\\nYou may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a\\nthird party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you\\nmake payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\\nconveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\\nlicense\\n\\n  - a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\\n    made from those copies), or\\n  - b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations\\n    that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or\\n    that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\\n\\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\\nlicense or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\\nyou under applicable patent law.\\n\\n### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\\n\\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\\nyou from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so\\nas to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other\\npertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For\\nexample, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for\\nfurther conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you\\ncould satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\\nfrom conveying the Program.\\n\\n### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\\n\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to\\nlink or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the\\nGNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey\\nthe resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the\\npart which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero\\nGeneral Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network\\nwill apply to the combination as such.\\n\\n### 14. Revised Versions of this License.\\n\\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\\nor concerns.\\n\\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\\nthat a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License or any later\\nversion applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\\nconditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by\\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number\\nof the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by\\nthe Free Software Foundation.\\n\\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the\\nGNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of\\nacceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for\\nthe Program.\\n\\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright\\nholder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\\n\\n### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\\n\\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\\nQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\\nCORRECTION.\\n\\n### 16. Limitation of Liability.\\n\\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\\nPERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\\nINCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\\nTHE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\\nPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\n\\n### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\\n\\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot\\nbe given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall\\napply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil\\nliability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of\\nliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\\n\\n## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ###\\n\\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\\n\\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\\n\\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion\\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the copyright line and a\\npointer to where the full notice is found.\\n\\n\\t<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\\n\\tCopyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n\\t\\n\\tThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\\n\\tit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\\n\\tthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\\n\\t(at your option) any later version.\\n\\t\\n\\tThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n\\tbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n\\tMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\\n\\tGNU General Public License for more details.\\n\\t\\n\\tYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\\n\\talong with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\\n\\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\\n\\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like\\nthis when it starts in an interactive mode:\\n\\n\\t<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\\n\\tThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type show w'.\\n\\tThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\\n\\tunder certain conditions; typeshow c' for details.\\n\\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate\\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might\\nbe different; for a GUI interface, you would use an about box.\\n\\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if\\nany, to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program, if necessary. For more\\ninformation on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\\n\\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\\nproprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\\nit more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\\nthis is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\\nof this License. But first, please read\\nhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.\\n\"",
