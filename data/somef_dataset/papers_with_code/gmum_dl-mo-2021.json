      "excerpt": "There will be three separate modules. In the first module of the course, we will focus on learning in a stationary setting where the neural network learns each objective at the same time.  to We will have multiple competing objectives. Investigating this, we will better understand how deep neural networks are trained, and what are some limitations. \nIn the second module, we will focus on life-long learning. How do we learn over course of multiple tasks? This seems to be a necessary capability on the path to artificial general intelligence.  \nIn the third module, we highlight several solutions, most likely focusing on meta-learning, modularity (including computational computation). These two solutions were shown to help deep network learn multiple objectives both in the sequential and stationary setting. \n",
