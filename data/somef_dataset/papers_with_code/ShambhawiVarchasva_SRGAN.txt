# SRGAN

The arhcitecture of the generator network is as shown in the figure.

The skeleton code is take from github.com/brade31919/SRGAN-tensorflow  which  is the implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf
I have designed my own generator architecture.
For the reference,one can go through the paper
