We will much appreciate your contribution.\nFor new features and new modules, unit tests are required to improve the code's robustness.\n\nCode style\nPython\nWe adopt PEP8 as the preferred code style.\nWe use the following tools for linting and formatting:\n\nflake8: linter\nyapf: formatter\nisort: sort imports\n\nStyle configurations of yapf and isort can be found in setup.cfg.\nWe use pre-commit hook that checks and formats for flake8, yapf, isort, trailing whitespaces,\n fixes end-of-files, sorts requirments.txt automatically on every commit.\nThe config for a pre-commit hook is stored in .pre-commit-config.\nAfter you clone the repository, you will need to install initialize pre-commit hook.\nshell\npip install -U pre-commit\nFrom the repository folder\nshell\npre-commit install\nIf you are facing issue when installing markdown lint, you may install ruby for markdown lint by following\n```shell\ninstall rvm\ncurl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s -- --autolibs=read-fail\nset up environment\nNote that you might need to edit ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.profile\nsource ~/.profile\nrvm autolibs disable\ninstall ruby\nrvm install 2.7.1\n```\nAfter this on every commit check code linters and formatter will be enforced.\n\nBefore you create a PR, make sure that your code lints and is formatted by yapf.\n\nC++ and CUDA\nWe follow the Google C++ Style Guide.",
