      "excerpt": "This repository provides a minimal implementation of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) (Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization) in TensorFlow 2. SAM is motivated by the connections between the geometry of the loss landscape of deep neural networks and their generalization ability. SAM attempts to simultaneously minimize loss value as well as loss curvature thereby seeking parameters in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss value. This is indeed different from traditional SGD-based optimization that seeks parameters having low loss values on an individual basis. The figure below (taken from the original paper) demonstrates the effects of using SAM -  \n",

The notebook is end-to-end executable on Google Colab. Furthermore, the notebook utilizes the free TPUs (TPUv2-8) Google Colab provides allowing quick experimentation. \nBefore moving to the findings, please be aware of the following notable differences in my implementation: \nResNet20 (attributed to this repository) is used as opposed to PyramidNet and WideResNet.  \n",

Table 1 of the original paper suggests using SGD with different configurations.  \nInstead of training for full number of epochs I used early stopping with a patience of 10. \nSAM has only one hyperparameter namely rho that controls the neighborhood of the parameter space. In my experiments, it's defaulted to 0.05. For other details related to training configuration (i.e. network depth, learning rate, batch size, etc.) please refer to the notebook. \n",
