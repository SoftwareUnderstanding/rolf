Our goal is to implement video segmentation in real time at least 24 fps on Google Pixel 2. We use efficient deep learning network specialized in mobile/embedded devices and exploit data redundancy between consecutive frames to reduce unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, the network can be optimized with 8-bits quantization provided by tf-lite.\n\n![Real-Time Video Segmentation(Credit: Google AI)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tantara/JejuNet/master/docs/real_time_video_segmentation_google_ai.gif)\n\n*Example: Reai-Time Video Segmentation(Credit: Google AI)*\n\n",
