    "excerpt": "Contributing to FairScale\nWe want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as\npossible.\nOur Development Process\nMinor changes and improvements will be released on an ongoing basis. Larger\nchanges (e.g., changesets implementing a new paper) will be released on a\nmore periodic basis.\nPull Requests\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from main.\nIf you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\nIf you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code passes static analysis (see below).\nIf you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\").\n\nContributor License Agreement (\"CLA\")\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need\nto do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.\nComplete your CLA here: https://code.facebook.com/cla\nIssues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is\nclear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\nFacebook has a bounty program for the safe\ndisclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process\noutlined on that page and do not file a public issue.\nEnvironment setup\n~$ python3 -m venv venv2\n~$ source venv2/bin/activate\n(venv2) ~$ cd git/fairscale/\n(venv2) ~/git/fairscale $ pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt\nCoding Style\n\nWe follow the PEP8 style guide.\nIn your editor, install the editorconfig extension\n  which should ensure that you are following the same standards as us.\nPlease read the editorconfig file to understand the exact coding style preferences.\nPlease place Python code related to models in fairscale/nn. Place Python code related to optimizers\n  in fairscale/optim. Place C++ extensions in fairscale/clib.\nPlease put __all__:List[str] = [] in new __init__.py files for consistent importing behavior\n  and less development overhead in maintaining an importing list.\nPlease setup pre-commit before opening up your PR.\n\nPre-Commit (Recommended)\nWe use pre-commit to maintain the coding style. Pre-Commit checks are run via Github Actions on every\ncommit. To install all the relevant libraries and run the pre-commit tests locally, execute the following\ncommands:\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\npre-commit install\nAfter the above, your git commit command will automatically trigger pre-commit checks.\nRunning static code analysis manually (Deprecated)\nNote that, trailing spaces are not checked by the manual commands below, but they are checked by the\npre-commit hooks we use above.\nblack .\nisort .\nflake8\nmypy --ignore-missing-imports --scripts-are-modules --pretty .\nTesting\nFairScale code is tested on Python 3.9.7, CUDA 11.2 and the following three PyTorch versions:\n- the latest stable version\n- the latest LTS version\n- a recent nightly release\nSee the README for the exact version numbers.\nUnit tests\n```\npytest\nsingle test\npython -m pytest tests/nn/data_parallel/test_oss_ddp.py::test_on_cpu\n```\nCheck test coverage\npython -m pytest --cov-report term --cov=fairscale/nn/data_parallel \\\n   tests/nn/data_parallel/test_oss_ddp.py::test_on_cpu\nCircleCI status\nFrom your PR page, you can expand on the CircleCI results. For GPU test, you should see\nwhat CI has run, like:\n...\n----- generated xml file: /home/circleci/fairscale/test-results/junit.xml ------\n================== 217 passed, 2 xfailed in 218.74s (0:03:38) ==================\nCircleCI received exit code 0\nThe number of passed and failed should give you an idea on whether your local\ntest was the same or not.\nCommit Guidelines\nWe follow the same guidelines as AngularJS. Each commit message consists of a header,\na body and a footer.  The header has a special format that includes a type,\nand a subject:\n```\n[<type>] <subject>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on github as well as in various git tools.\n\n### Type\n\nMust be one of the following:\n\n* **feat**: A new feature\n* **fix**: A bug fix\n* **cleanup**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\n  semi-colons, dead code removal etc.)\n* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature\n* **perf**: A code change that improves performance\n* **test**: Adding missing tests or fixing them\n* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation\ngeneration\n* **docs**: Documentation only changes\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to fairscale, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.",
