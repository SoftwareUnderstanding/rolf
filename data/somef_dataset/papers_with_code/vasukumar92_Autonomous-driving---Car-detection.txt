# Autonomous-driving---Car-detection
The notebook presents the AI based object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).  You will learn to:  Use object detection on a car detection dataset Deal with bounding boxes
