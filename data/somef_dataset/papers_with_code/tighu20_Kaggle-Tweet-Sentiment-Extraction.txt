# Kaggle-Tweet-Sentiment-Extraction
Extract support phrases for sentiment labels

Below is the Kaggle Challenge Description

"""With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.

Help build your skills in this important area with this broad dataset of tweets. Work on your technique to grab a top spot in this competition. What words in tweets support a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment? How can you help make that determination using machine learning tools?"""

I have trained a Language model using Tensorflow which employs RoBERTa and can extract support phrases from a tweet which primarily contribute to the sentiment expressed by that tweet. (top 10% Leader-board)
