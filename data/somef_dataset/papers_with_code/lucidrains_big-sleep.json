This repository wraps up his work so it is easily accessible to anyone who owns a GPU.\n\nYou will be able to have the GAN dream up images using natural language with a one-line command in the terminal.\n\nOriginal notebook [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-notebook]\n\nSimplified notebook [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-notebook-2]\n\n[colab-notebook]: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NCceX2mbiKOSlAd_o7IU7nA9UskKN5WR?usp=sharing>\n[colab-notebook-2]: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MEWKbm-driRNF8PrU7ogS5o3se-ePyPb?usp=sharing>\n[colab-badge]: <https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg>\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ pip install big-sleep\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n$ dream \"a pyramid made of ice\"\n```\n\nImages will be saved to wherever the command is invoked\n\n## Advanced\n\nYou can invoke this in code with\n\n```python\nfrom big_sleep import Imagine\n\ndream = Imagine(\n    text = \"fire in the sky\",\n    lr = 5e-2,\n    save_every = 25,\n    save_progress = True\n"
