# LAMB Optimizer (TensorFlow)
This is a simple implementation of LAMB Optimizer, which appeared in the paper [**"Large Batch Optimization for Deep Learning: Training BERT in 76 minutes"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962v3). 

The older name of the paper was ["Reducing BERT Pre-Training Time from 3 Days to 76 Minutes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962v1)


## Notes
- **This is NOT an official implementation.**
- LAMB optimizer changes slightly from arXiv v1 ~ v3.
- We implement v3 version (which is the latest version on June, 2019.).
- Some uncertain parts are clarified by consulting original authors (such as `scaling function`).


## Algorithm
LAMB optimizer is originally designed for large batch learning in neural networks, but could also used in small batch size as indicated by authors.

## Usage
The implementation is based on BERT [repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert), which uses `AdamWeightDecayOptimizer` (appears in [`optimization.py`](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/optimization.py)) for pre-training and fine-tuning.

- Just use `LAMBOptimizer` as a regular optimizer in TensorFlow, similar to `Adam` or `AdamWeightDecayOptimizer`.
- Find LAMB optimizer in `optimization.py`.
- There is nothing special to tune other than initial `learning_rate`.


## Results on MNIST
- I don't have TPU Pod to test its scalability on BERT with large batch ðŸ˜‚, but tested on MNIST for verify its effectiveness.
- All optimizers use an initial learning rate of **0.001** (default settings), and did **NOT** scale to the batch size (may bring another gain, but leave it for you to test).
- All the experiments are done on NVIDIA TESLA T4.

Here are the numbers on several three classical neural networks **(MLP, CNN, Bi-RNN, Bi-GRU, Bi-LSTM)** with different optimizers **(Adam, AdamW, LAMB)**. 

I only list results of batch={64, 128, 1024, 16384}. For full results, please see [`FULL_RESULTS.md`](https://github.com/ymcui/LAMB_Optimizer_TF/blob/master/FULL_RESULTS.md).

### Several Conclusions
**Note: The conclusions are only made by the results above.**

- LAMB consistently outperforms `Adam` and `AdamW` in most of the times, and shows consistent results among different batch sizes.
- LAMB shows big advantage than `Adam` and `AdamW` on large batch, showing its excellent scalability.
- LAMB failed to outperform than `Adam` and `AdamW` on complex RNN-based models, despite batch size.


## Reproducibility
Check [`mnist_tensorflow.ipynb`](https://github.com/ymcui/LAMB_Optimizer_TF/blob/master/mnist_tensorflow.ipynb) for details.

Note: You know the GPU/TPU won't get exactly the same results even we use fixed random seed.
