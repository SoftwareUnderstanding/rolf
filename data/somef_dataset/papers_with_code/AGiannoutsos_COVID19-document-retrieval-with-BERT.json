The corpus then is batched in sentences and batches of sentences are \nfeed in every model. From the output of the models' embeddings are generated for every sentence in the documents and they are stored and zipped in the cloud. \nAfter the transformation of the corpus into vectors of words, follows the question answering part.  \nWe download and unzip the embeddings of all the documents per each embedding model method. Afterward, we ask for a question. We transform the question into an  \nembedding vector and we search with cosine similarity through the dataset the most similar sentence embedding to our question for each model method. \nFinally, we can evaluate our results. \n",
