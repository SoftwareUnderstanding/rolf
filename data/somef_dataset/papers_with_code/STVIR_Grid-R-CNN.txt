# Grid R-CNN

An mmdetection based implementation of updated Grid R-CNN published on CVPR 2019. Original paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12030), details of updates can be seen in this [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05688).

## Installation

This project is based on mmdetection object detection framework.

### Requirements

- Python 3.5+ ([Say goodbye to Python2](https://python3statement.org/))
- PyTorch 1.0+ or PyTorch-nightly
- CUDA 9.0+
- GCC 4.9+
- [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv)

### Install Grid R-CNN with mmdetection

a. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it. Then install Cython.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y
source activate open-mmlab

conda install cython
```

b. Install PyTorch stable or nightly and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/).

c. Clone the this repository.

d. Compile cuda extensions.

```shell
./compile.sh
```

e. Setup mmdetection (other dependencies will be installed automatically).

```shell
python setup.py develop
# or "pip install -e ."
```

### Dataset Preparation

It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to your project.

## Training and Testing

We provide training and testing scripts and config files for Grid R-CNN. An example configuration file is [here](configs/grid_rcnn_r50_fpn_2x.py), corresponding checkpoint is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RCtNjb_JruBtl6sCq5w_XXN1e0ksn_f6/view?usp=sharing). Note that the batchsize we used is 64(32 GPUs/2 images per GPU), you could adjust the learning rate and warmup schedule according to your batchsize.

Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for more basic usage of mmdetection.

## Results

Training on Res50/101 FPN backbone and Testing on COCO minival. Inference speed is tested on our TITANXp GPU cluster.
