One can select the backend (pytorch or keras) by changing the `nnet.keras` line to `nnet.pytorch`. You can play against the trained model by running `play.py`.\n\nThree games are available, being either TicTacToe, Othello, or Chess. TicTacToe and Othello board sizes can be changed by utilising their parameter setting, e.g. `TicTacToe(5)` produces a 5x5 TicTacToe board, and `Othello(10)` would produce a 10x10 Othello board.\n",
