Then it detects objects using the Conv4_3 layer.  \nFor illustration, we draw the Conv4_3 to be 8 \u00d7 8 spatially (it should be 38 \u00d7 38). For each cell (also called location), it makes 4 object predictions.Each prediction composes of a boundary box and 21 scores for each class (one extra class for no object), and we pick the highest score as the class for the bounded object. Conv4_3 makes a total of 38 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 4 predictions: four predictions per cell regardless of the depth of the feature maps. As expected, many predictions contain no object. SSD reserves a class \u201c0\u201d to indicate it has no objects. \nSSD does not use a delegated region proposal network. Instead, it resolves to a very simple method. It computes both the location and class scores using small convolution filters. After extracting the feature maps, SSD applies 3 \u00d7 3 convolution filters for each cell to make predictions. (These filters compute the results just like the regular CNN filters.) Each filter outputs 25 channels: 21 scores for each class plus one boundary box. \nIt uses multiple layers (multi-scale feature maps) to detect objects independently. As CNN reduces the spatial dimension gradually, the resolution of the feature maps also decrease. SSD uses lower resolution layers to detect larger scale objects. For example, the 4\u00d7 4 feature maps are used for larger scale object. \nSSD adds 6 more auxiliary convolution layers after the VGG16. Five of them will be added for object detection. In three of those layers, we make 6 predictions instead of 4. In total, SSD makes 8732 predictions using 6 layers. \n",

If the corresponding default boundary box (not the predicted boundary box) has an IoU greater than 0.5 with the ground truth, the match is positive. Otherwise, it is negative. (IoU, the Intersection over Union, is the ratio between the intersected area over the joined area for two regions.) \n",
