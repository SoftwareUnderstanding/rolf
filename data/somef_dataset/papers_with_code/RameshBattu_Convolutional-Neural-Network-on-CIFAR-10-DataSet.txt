#### Understanding the DataSet

- The CIFAR-10 small photo classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deeplearning.

- CIFAR is an acronym that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and the CIFAR-10 dataset was developed along with the CIFAR-100 dataset by researchers at the CIFAR institute.

- The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32×32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes, such as frogs, birds, cats, ships, etc. The class labels and their standard associated integer values are listed
below.

- 0: airplane 1: automobile 2: bird 3: cat 4: deer 5: dog 6: frog 7: horse 8: ship 9: truck

- These are very small images, much smaller than a typical photograph, and the dataset was intended for computer vision research.

- CIFAR-10 is a well-understood dataset and widely used for benchmarking computer vision algorithms in the field of machine learning. The problem is “solved.” It is relatively straightforward to achieve 80% classification accuracy.

- Top performance on the problem is achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks with a classification accuracy above 90% on the test dataset.
