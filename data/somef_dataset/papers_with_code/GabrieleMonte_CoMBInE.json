By gross mean we refer to the total mean of the image of the absolute value of the difference taken within the 3 values of R,G and B color for all pixels in the image. Theoretically, for a perfect recontruction, this value should be always zero. The second parameter defined, which relates to this mean difference, is its standard deviation of all the pixels from the image of the absolute difference. Again, for a perfect reconstruction, this value also tends to zero. To get a more detailed idea wheter or not the mean difference computed is actually small or not, we also defined the mean percentage difference where the percentage is calculated with  respect to the target. \nThe analysis python scripts that refer to these parameters are *target_vs_prediction_random-images_gross_difference.py* and *target_vs_prediction_vs_mask-size_gross_difference.py*. In the first one we analyze the predictions after each epoch for 50 random images taken from the  validation set masked with 1 mask made of random shapes. In the second one we analyze the predictions after each epoch for 1 image, given possible masking sizes and shapes (specifically we use 1 random shape mask and 12 centered circular masks with radius ranging from 5 to 65"

Traditional CNN filter responses are conditioned on both valid pixels as well as the substitute values in the masked holes which may lead to color discrepancy and blurriness. The partial convolutions are constructed such that, given a binary mask, the results depend only on the non-hole regions at every layer. Given sufficient layers of successive updates and with the addition of the automatic mask update step, which removes any masking where the partial convolution was able to operate on an unmasked value, even the largest masked holes will eventually shrink away, leaving only valid responses in the feature map. \n",

Indeed, this choice was made in order to achieve better results for CMB maps with parameters closer to the one observationally measured (by better results we mean enhancing the ability of CoMBInE, for SSI near 0.95, to distinguish maps in regard to the SSI they belong to). \nThe batch size was increased to 16 and the number of steps per epoch and the validation steps were changed accordingly to that and the total new number of images in the dataset (specifically 6250 steps and 625 validation steps). The motivation for this increase in the batch size is to ensure that CoMBInE passes minimum through one image per class before updating its weights.

First of all there is a dimensional problem since each pixel is composed by a 3 dimensional array corresponding to the values of red, green and blue. Thus we need to reduce the RGB images to Grey scale. This is rather simple but unfortunately does not fix the full problem. Indeed any image repsentation of the CMB map (like the ones simulated by CAMB) do not encode all the information about the temperatures at each point in the sky. Indeed when one simulates CMB maps for visualization purposes, a limit is set on the range of temperatures such that T can only vary within T_min and T_max. This implies that each point at a higher temperature than T_max is assigned the same color as those at excactly T_max. The effect on the power spectrum should not be that significant but it's definetely something to take into account as it would schew the final results and eventually the goal of CoMBInE is to compute power spectra from actual CMB data so we need to be precise. The strategy is then twofold, on one side we can compare these schewed power spectra of the predicted and target image as another way to test to what extent CoMBInE is able to reproduce CMB maps. On the other side we need to change the architecture of the program such that it can intake 2 dimensional arrays where to each pixel would correspond 1 number proportional to the temperature and not limited to the any range. This requires some work as all the convolutional layers were build to intake images with dimensions (128x128x3) where the filter matrices had specific kernel dimensions which change accordingly based on the initial image size. \nValidate our results with real data from the CMB temperature map \nThis would be the final stage of the project as eventually we would like to use CoMBInE to fill in the holes of the patches of the sky where the effect of the foreground is not neglegible, to then compute a Power Spectrum of the entire CMB map. \n",
