      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147\n\nTwo models are created with the same Enet architecture:\n\n-  One is trained on RGB images\n-  The other is trained on Canny Equivalent of images. This has been done to reduce the information that the model needs to process.\n\nMasks were created by plotting the nodes provided for Bezier Curve in the 'poly2D' key of the Labels Json.\n\nThe model was able to achieve a Mean IoU of ~0.7 on the validation and testing set. The Model was evaluated for a video and various images for different working conditions  \n\n**Files:** \n\n1. ECE1512_HOMEWORK3-by-VAIBHAV GUPTA_V2: Contains the complete upto date code. However, the print command for model summaries has been ommited. This has been done because GitHub removes the scroll for displaying long outputs from a jupyter notebook and displays the complete information. In case one does not to want to scroll through that information this version is to be used.\n\n2. ECE1512_HOMEWORK3-by-VAIBHAV GUPTA: Contains the complete upto date code along with the print commands for model summaries.\n\n3. Challenge.mp4: Original Video\n\n4. Output1.mp4: Processed Video"
