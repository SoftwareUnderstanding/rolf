This code is implemented in Torch7 (written in Lua); more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nMemN2N-babi-matlab: The code for the MemN2N bAbI task experiments of Section 4 of the paper \"End-To-End Memory Networks\". This code is implemented in Matlab; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nDBLL: Code to train MemN2N on tasks from the paper \"Dialog-based Language Learning\". This code is implemented in Torch7; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nHITL: Code to train MemN2N on tasks from the paper \"Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop\". This code is implemented in Torch7; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nAskingQuestions: Code to train MemN2N on tasks from the paper \"Learning through Dialogue Interactions\". This code is implemented in Torch7; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nKVmemnn: Code to train MemN2N on tasks from the paper \"Key-Value Memory Networks for Directly Reading Documents\". This code is implemented in Torch7; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory. \nEntNet-babi: Code to train an Entity Network on bAbI tasks, as described in the paper \"Tracking the World State with Recurrent Entity Networks\".
