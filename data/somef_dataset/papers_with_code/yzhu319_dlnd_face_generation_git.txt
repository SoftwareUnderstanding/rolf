# DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks)

Algorithm: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

- Define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new (imaginary) images of human faces that look realistic.

- Data source: the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA).
