# DetectoRS

## News

[06/30/2020] DetectoRS is now officially supported by [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
A huge thanks to [@xvjiarui](https://github.com/xvjiarui), [@ZwwWayne](https://github.com/ZwwWayne) and [@hellock](https://github.com/hellock) for helping migrating the code.

[06/15/2020] We have released the implementation of DetectoRS based on mmdetection-v2 in the branch **mmdetv2**, which allows more detectors to use RFP and SAC.

## Introduction

This repo holds the code for [DetectoRS: Detecting Objects with Recursive Feature Pyramid and Switchable Atrous Convolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02334.pdf).
The project is based on [mmdetection codebase](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
Please refer to [mmdetection readme](README.mmdet.md) for installation and running scripts.
The code is tested with PyTorch 1.4.0.
It may not run with other versions.
See [conda_env.md](conda_env.md) for the versions of all the packages.
