# Flower Recognition
What kind of flower is that?

# Description
The goal of the project is to identify flowers belonging to five classes: daisy, tulip, rose, sunflower and dandelion. 
The dataset is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition.
I have built a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using tensorflow and keras to classify the flowers. Furthermore, I have implemented tranfer learning where I have used the weights of the InceptionV3 model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) trained on the ImageNet Dataset (http://www.image-net.org/).

# Note
Here my aim is not to improve accuracy of this CNN model but to provide a code that can be used in a range of image classification problems with minor tweaks.
