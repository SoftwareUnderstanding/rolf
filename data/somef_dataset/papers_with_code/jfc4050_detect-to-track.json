      "excerpt": "* Training follows the approximate joint training scheme, instead of using an alternating training scheme. See this paper for a summary of training schemes commonly used for two-stage networks. I am very interested in seeing if the use of a differentiable RoI-Warping layer will significantly improve the performance of this training scheme, so that may be implemented at some point. \n* Any gradients related to losses contributed by anchors crossing the image boundary are not used. They are masked out before the backward pass. \n* Focal loss is used instead of Binary Cross-Entropy loss with Online Hard Example Mining. \n* This implementation uses a slightly modified version of the Viterbi algorithm for tubelet linking. The difference between this implementation of the viterbi algorithm vs the version used in the paper is that at each time step an additional \"path\" is added, beginning at that time step and only containing a single state. This accomodates tubelets beginning in the middle of the sequence. See detect_to_track/viterbi.py for additional details. \nThis project depends on my assorted collection of machine learning utilities, which can be found here. The library is very immature so please pay close attention to the version number specified in this project's requirements.txt. \n",
