      "excerpt": "The API server automatically generates an interactive Swagger documentation page. Go to `http://localhost:5000` to load\nit. From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.\nUse the `model/predict` endpoint to generate an audio clip from one of the provided models, which can then be played in\nthe Swagger UI.\n\n![Swagger UI Screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)\n\nYou can also test it on the command line. The `model/predict` endpoint returns a bytestream of the audio, which you can\nthen direct into a file using `>`; for example:\n\n```bash\n $ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/model/predict' -H 'accept: audio/wav' > result.wav\n```\n\nThis will save the generated `wav` file in the current directory.\n\nYou can generate samples for different classes of audio by setting the `model` request parameter to one of: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `stop`, `go` or `lofi-instrumentals` (the default). For example to generate a sample of the word `stop`:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/model/predict?model=stop' -H 'accept: audio/wav' > stop.wav\n```\n\n",
