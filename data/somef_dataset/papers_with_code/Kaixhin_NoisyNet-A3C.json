      "excerpt": "On the whole, NoisyNet-A3C tends to be better than A3C (with or without entropy regularisation). There seems to be more variance, with both good and poor runs, probably due to \"deep\" exploration. \nNoisyNet-A3C is perhaps even more prone to performance collapses than normal A3C. Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms are still prone to this. \n",

      "excerpt": "A3C with entropy regularisation usually performs a bit better than A3C without entropy regularisation, and also poor runs of NoisyNet-A3C. The performance tends to be significantly worse than the best NoisyNet-A3C runs. \nNote that due to the nondeterminism introduced by asynchronous agents, different runs on even the same seed can produce different results, and hence the results presented are only single samples of the performance of these algorithms. Interestingly, the general observations above seem to hold even when increasing the number of processes (experiments were repeated with 16 processes). These algorithms are still sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and will need to be tuned extensively to get good performance on other domains. \n",
