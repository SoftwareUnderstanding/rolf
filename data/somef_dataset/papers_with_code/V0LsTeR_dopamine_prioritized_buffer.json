A virtual environment lets you control which dependencies are\ninstalled for which program; however, this step is optional and you may choose\nto ignore it.\n\nDopamine is a Tensorflow-based framework, and we recommend you also consult\nthe [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)\nfor additional details.\n\nFinally, these instructions are for Python 2.7. While Dopamine is Python 3\ncompatible, there may be some additional steps needed during installation.\n\nFirst install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), which\nwe will use as the environment manager, then proceed below.\n\n```\nconda create --name dopamine-env python=3.6\nconda activate dopamine-env\n```\n\nThis will create a directory called `dopamine-env` in which your virtual\nenvironment lives. The last command activates the environment.\n\nInstall the dependencies below, based on your operating system, and then\nfinally download the Dopamine source, e.g.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/google/dopamine.git\n```\n\n",
