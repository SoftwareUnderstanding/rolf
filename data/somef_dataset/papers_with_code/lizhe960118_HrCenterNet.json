For more technical details, please refer to the arXiv paper. \nCenterNet is an one-stage detector which gets trained from scratch. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0%, which surpasses all known one-stage detectors, and even gets very close to the top-performance two-stage detectors. \n",
