      "excerpt": "The quantization is performed in three major steps. First, calculating the statistics for the gradient distribution by sampling the gradient. Second, instantiating the distribution object (e.g. for norm-based methods instantiating the CondTruncNormalHist class and for the norm-less methods instantiating the TruncNorm). Third, updating the levels according to the specified method. \nThis functionality is mainly implemented in three files: \nThis file implements the necessary distribution classes. Two of the classes are used throughout the project: \n",

      "excerpt": "This class requires a list of norms, means, and sigmas which are the statistics for individual buckets of the gradient. Then \nby creating buckets it approximates the distribution generated by the weighted sum of the Truncated Normal distributions. \nThis is the file that implements different quantization schemes. ALQ is implemented in alq function. The AMQ variations are implemented in this and this line. \nOther important function is update_levels. This function updates the gradient levels at the specified interations using the appropriate quantization scheme. We try various initializations for AMQ and ALQ to make sure that we have found the best set of levels. The proxy metric that we use to estimate quantization error is the Variance error which is calculated on the given distribution. This is calculated in the Distribution class. \nThe important function in this file is snap_online_mean function. This is the function that calculates norms, means, and sigmas of the individual buckets of the gradient samples. At the end of the function it selects the stats with the largest norms that contribute most to the aggregated distribution. \nThis function also needs to calculate the mean variance and mean of the gradient samples for the norm-less methods. \n",
