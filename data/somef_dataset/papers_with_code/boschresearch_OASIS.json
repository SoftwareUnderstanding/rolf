At the beginning of training, the inception moments of the real images are computed before the actual training loop starts. How frequently the FID should be evaluated is controlled via the parameter --freq_fid, which is set to 5000 steps by default. The inception net that is used for FID computation automatically downloads a pre-trained inception net checkpoint. If that automatic download fails, for instance because your server has restricted internet access, get the checkpoint named pt_inception-2015-12-05-6726825d.pth from here and place it in /utils/fid_folder/. In this case, do not forget to replace load_state_dict_from_url function accordingly. \n",
