Contemporary-Neural-Network

This code implements a Classifier Neural Network using pure Scipy/Numpy (https://www.scipy.org/)

The code uses common contemporary algorithms for studying purposes, backprapogation is done with Tensor multiplication for better performance. The Iris Dataset is included for overfit testing.
