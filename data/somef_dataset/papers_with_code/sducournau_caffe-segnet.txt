# Caffe SegNet
**This is a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) which supports the [SegNet architecture](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/)**

As described in **SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation** Vijay Badrinarayanan, Alex Kendall and Roberto Cipolla, PAMI 2017 [http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561]

# Updated Version:
**This version supports cudnn v2 acceleration. @TimoSaemann has a branch supporting a more recent version of Caffe (Dec 2016) with cudnn v5.1:

## Getting Started with Example Model and Webcam Demo

If you would just like to try out a pretrained example model, then you can find the model used in the [SegNet webdemo](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/) and a script to run a live webcam demo here:
https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial

For a more detailed introduction to this software please see the tutorial here:

### Dataset

Prepare a text file of space-separated paths to images (jpegs or pngs) and corresponding label images alternatively e.g. ```/path/to/im1.png /another/path/to/lab1.png /path/to/im2.png /path/lab2.png ...```

Label images must be single channel, with each value from 0 being a separate class. The example net uses an image size of 360 by 480.

### Net specification

Example net specification and solver prototext files are given in examples/segnet.
To train a model, alter the data path in the ```data``` layers in ```net.prototxt``` to be your dataset.txt file (as described above).

In the last convolution layer, change ```num_output``` to be the number of classes in your dataset.

### Training

In solver.prototxt set a path for ```snapshot_prefix```. Then in a terminal run
```./build/tools/caffe train -solver ./examples/segnet/solver.prototxt```
