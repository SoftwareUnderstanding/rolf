This seems to cause a bias on the batch-size as the mean loss is evenly distributed on the single latents in the backward pass. This is fixed by summing over the batch dimension for the latent loss instead of using the mean. \nLatent modulation from Modulated Periodic Activations for Generalizable Local Functional Representations is implemented and can optionally be used. \n",
