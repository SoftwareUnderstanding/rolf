Support for conditional models will come soon.\r\n- Powerful Application Toolkit: A plentiful toolkit containing multiple applications in GANs is provided to users. GAN interpolation, GAN projection, and GAN manipulations are integrated into our framework. It's time to play with your GANs!\r\n- Efficient Distributed Training for Generative Models: For the highly dynamic training in generative models, we adopt a new way to train dynamic models with `MMDDP`.\r\n- New Modular Design for Flexible Combination: A new design for complex loss modules is proposed for customizing the links between modules, which can achieve flexible combinations among different modules.",
