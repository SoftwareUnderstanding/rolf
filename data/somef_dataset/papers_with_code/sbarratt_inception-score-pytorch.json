It takes a list of numpy images normalized to the range [0,1] and a set of arguments and then calculates the inception score. Please assure your images are 3x299x299 and if not (e.g. your GAN was trained on CIFAR), pass `resize=True` to the function to have it automatically resize using bilinear interpolation before passing the images to the inception network.\n\n```python\ndef inception_score(imgs, cuda=True, batch_size=32, resize=False, splits=1):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inception score of the generated images imgs\n    imgs -- Torch dataset of (3xHxW) numpy images normalized in the range [-1, 1]\n    cuda -- whether or not to run on GPU\n    batch_size -- batch size for feeding into Inception v3\n    splits -- number of splits\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n",
