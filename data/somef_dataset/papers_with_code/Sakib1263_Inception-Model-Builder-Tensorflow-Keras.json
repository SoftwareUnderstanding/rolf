Inception_v2 architecture is similar to v3 but during the input, a traditional convolutional layer has been replaced by a DepthWise Separable Convolutional layer.

The MLP layer contains Global Pooling, Flattening and final Dense layer selective for Classification or Regression tasks. \nThe primary differences between Inception v3 and v4 are in the Stem structure and the number of Inception (A, B and C) modules in each step.

Varying number of input kernel/filter, commonly known as the 'Width' of the model. Default is 32, which is better to use following the paper. \n3.
