      "excerpt": "Deep Convolutional GAN are nothing but GAN's with Deep Convolutional layers. Google has released a pre-built model for MNIST digit generation using DCGAN, you can find out more from the link below. Here, I am trying to take it one step forward and create a DCGAN model for CelebA dataset using Tensorflow 2.0. Note that the this time number of dimensions and channels would be different as oppose to MNIST because CelebA dataset has coloured images. For this, I had to create the Generator again which can generate coloured Images.  \n",
