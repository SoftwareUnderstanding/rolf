### About Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks

If you're new to ESRGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating 
realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied 
with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of 
SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive 
an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without 
batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN 
to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the 
perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness 
consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently 
better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in 
the PIRM2018-SR Challenge. The code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) .

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. 
It receives a random noise z and generates images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is 
a discriminant network that discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is a picture, 
and the output is D of x is the probability that x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, 
and if it's 0, it's not real.
