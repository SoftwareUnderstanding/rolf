I afraid it's problematic.  \nSinGAN is trained with single image. It means batch size is always 1.  \nTherefore batch norm works like instance norm while training.  \nBut when it comes to inference phase, batch norm uses running stats of training phase. It can be much different from training phase.  \n\nTo avoid this, I simply replaced batch norm with instance norm.\n\n\n### Cease WGAN-GP training\n\nAs I wrote in [the issue](https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN/issues/59), original implementation of gradient penalty looks wrong.  \nAnyway S4TF doesn't support higher-order differentiaion for now. So I decided not to use WGAN-GP.\n\n### Use spectral normalization\n\nSince I didn't use WGAN-GP, I need other techniques to stabilize training.  \nI employed [spectral normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957) and use hinge loss."
