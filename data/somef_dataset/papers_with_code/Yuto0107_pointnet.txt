# PointNet
Implementation of PointNet by PyTorch. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)

This is the explanation of PointNet as I wrote. (https://qiita.com/yuto_hito/items/707a5c57bca41a145122)

To check varidity of PointNet, I experiment the 2 classification task.

One data is sampled from uniform distribution and other is sampled from normal distribution as 3D data.

In this experiment, PoinNet has high performance.
