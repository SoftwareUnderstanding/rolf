      "excerpt": "1.  We tried to use pruning as an architecture search algorithm, i.e. starting from a wider network, using some pruning algorithm to prune certain channels, obtaining a thinner network and retraining it from scratch. \n    We tested the NetAdapt, MorphNet and Fisher pruning. Interestingly, NetAdapt was later used for the same purpose in MobileNetsv3 (that where not public when we started this thesis).  \n    Unfortunately, all the algorithms we tested did not show better results than mere random pruning on a WideResNet-40-2 on CIFAR-10 using a raspberry-pi 3B to perform inference. Wether it is also the case for other architectures/hardwares/datasets remains to be determined. \n1.  We tried to use knowledge distillation, this did show interesting improvements but only for MobileNetv1 (We don't know why -- seems like something worth exploring in details). We also tried to use tensorflow's built-in quantization capabilities and managed to use them on MobileNetv1/v2 without SE blocks. We could only make posttraining quantization work and this was quite tricky. For the moment, quantization is not so well integrated into tensorflow. Posttraining quantization results were not integrated to the report since tensorflow released posttraining quantization between the report and presentation deadlines. See last slide of the final presentation for results. \n",
