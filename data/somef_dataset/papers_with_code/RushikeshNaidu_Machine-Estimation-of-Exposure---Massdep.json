      "excerpt": "This repository contains the end-to-end process in building a classification algorithm to classify exposures from immediate response action reports \nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) is an agency of the commonwealth of massachusetts which ensures the timely cleanup of land, water and air. Immediate Response Reports are mandatory risk reduction measure taken at sites which have been impacted by sudden chemical releases or conditions requiring rapid notification to the MassDEP. \nThe officials at MassDEP summarize these reports into a preliminary action form which contains 5 flag questions each concerning one media, namely, groundwater, public water supply, private water supply, monitoring well and indoor air. If any of these media has been affected, the condition is classified as an exposure and needs to be revisited.  \nThe project seeks to classify these reports into exposures or not exposure understanding and learning patterns in the immediate response action reports. \nThe immediate response action reports are present on the MassDEP website and the project built a data crawler to pull all these reports on the local machine. \n",
