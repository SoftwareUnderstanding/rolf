# Simple implementation of Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) using keras
Simple keras implementation of a generative adversarial neural network, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661

# How to run this repo
If you have virtualen installed run the following commands from the repo folder

```
virtualenv env

source env/bin/ativate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
then you can run the code by simply: 
```
python gan.py

```

if you dont have virtual env installed you can install it like this: 

```
pip install virtualenv

```
