# ml-dna

This repo will cover different machine learning problems and its solution.

Solution to the problems will mostly be in python and explanation will be in source files


Problem no 1: 

source directory : /sales-generation/

Design and Develop ML based sales lead generation system.

1) DataScience-Problem.docx => This file provides detailed description of the problem.
2) DataScience-Problem-Data.csv => This file contains data to train and test ml models.
3) ml-sales-lead.ipynb  => solution for the problem in iPython notebook.
4) ML-based-lead-generation.html => solution in html format with detailed analysis of the problem.

following ml algos were analyzed : 

1) Decision Tree Classifier  : Using entropy (information gain) criterion.

2) Decision Tree using Grid serach.

3) Ensemble : Random Forest.

4) Logistic classifier.

5) Deep Neural Network with Keras and Theano.

Problem no: 2

source directory : /deepnet-examples/tensorflow

1) Created a baseline linear regression model and Tensor flow model for comparision.
2) Example in baselineModelAndTFModel.py is mini batch SGD implementation.
3) Lot of comments in the code to drive the point.
