      "excerpt": "Understanding the spread of information and particularly disinformation is vital to today's world. Data on the spread of competing narratives by bot agents is difficult to gather at scale over extended periods. We provide a simulation tool kit that enables researchers to understand this problem by model the interaction of bot agents competing to spread different narratives to a broader community. \nWe created a data science tooling system that enables researchers to understand social networks better. In the initial step of our simulation, we create randomized graphs that are similar in edge distributions to real-world social networks. Then for each of the nodes in the graph, we assign an agent type (non-bot neutral, bot promoting idea A, bot promoting idea B). We initialize the spread of information through the graph by beginning with the bots as the only ones trying to spread their respective ideas. Then at each time step we use, the edges of the graph, the identity of the agent, and the current held the belief of each agent to determine a percent chance that information is spread to a new agent. We keep track of the history of all of the information in the network to create our simulated data set. To visualize this complex system of interactions we created an animated assistant that shows off all of the information of the graph. Each node has an identity denoted by its inner darker color, the current idea that the node is spreading is shown by the outer lighter color, and the active connections in the graph are colored edges. \nYou may have heard of fully-connected NNs, Convolutional NNs, or even Recurrent NNs but none of these models are designed to learn on graphical data. Graphical data is everywhere from social networks to protein folding. Essentially, GNNs are designed to take advantage of graphical structure to make better predictions. \nThis Graph Neural Network model explores a node's neighbors across connections and aggregates this 'communal' information to understand the content and relationships contained in the graph. See the graphic below: \n",
