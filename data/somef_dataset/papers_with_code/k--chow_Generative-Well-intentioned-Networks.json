      "excerpt": "This is an implementation of the GWIN paper, which maps the uncertain distribution of a probabilistic classifier to its more confident distribution. The use case here is demonstrated with a bayesian neural network classifier on MNIST with a WGAN-GP. We map samples of an certainty rejection threshold from our classifier to new samples generated by a WGAN-GP that has a critic trained to discern uncertain and confident samples.  \nSome cherry-picked examples (left is original, right is new sample): \nNote that there are some differences in the paper and my code which my account for performance differences, especially regarding GAN training. I have tried to mimic the paper closely but there may still be small differences that have large impact  \nWe normalize data -1 to 1 to use a tanh rather than a sigmoid in the generator \nWe use batch norm in the generator (from my limited experience trains faster) and layer normalization in the critic (noted in the original WGAN-GP paper) \n",
