Implementation of super resolution algorithm SRGAN and EDSR for microCT image super resolution.
The architectures are described in the following papers:

EDSR (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02921)

SRGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)

Some code in this repository is modified from the repository "Collection of Super-Resolution models via PyTorch" (https://github.com/togheppi/pytorch-super-resolution-model-collection)

A tutorial of the code named Tutorial.ipynb is included.
