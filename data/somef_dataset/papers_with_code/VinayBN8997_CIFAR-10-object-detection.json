      "excerpt": "An important difference between DenseNet and existing network architectures is that DenseNet can have very narrow layers, e.g., k = 12. Here k is the growth rate which represents the number of feature maps for each layer of convolution. \nA 1\u00d71 convolution is be introduced as bottleneck layer before each 3\u00d73 convolution to reduce the number of input feature-maps, and thus to improve computational efficiency. \nTo further improve model compactness, the number of feature-maps at transition layers is reduced uisng a compression factor. If a dense block contains m feature-maps, the following transition layer generate \u03b8*m output featuremaps. \nAt the end of the last dense block, i.e, in the output block, a global average pooling is performed and then a softmax classifier is attached. \n",
