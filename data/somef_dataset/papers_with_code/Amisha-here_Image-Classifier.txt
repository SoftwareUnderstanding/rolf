# Image-Classifier

Image Classifier app made using ml5.js. ml5 uses a MobileNet (a type of machine learning "pre-trained" model) created with TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library from TensorFlow.

It use neural networks to recognize the content of images. ml5.imageClassifier() is a method to create an object that classifies an image using a pre-trained model.

It should be noted that the pre-trained model provided by the example below was trained on a database of approximately 15 million images (ImageNet). The ml5 library accesses this model from the cloud. What the algorithm labels an image is entirely dependent on that training data - what is included, excluded, and how those images are labeled (or mislabeled).
