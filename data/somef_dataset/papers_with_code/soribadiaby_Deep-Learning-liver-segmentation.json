We use the nibabel library (http://nipy.org/nibabel/) to read associated images and masks. \n<p>We train a U-net architecture, a fully convolutional network. The principle of this architecture is to add to a usual contracting network, layers with upsampling operators instead of pooling. This allow the network to learn context (contracting path), then localization (expansive path). Context information is propagated to higher resolution layers thanks to skip-connexions. So we have images of the same size as input</p> \n",
