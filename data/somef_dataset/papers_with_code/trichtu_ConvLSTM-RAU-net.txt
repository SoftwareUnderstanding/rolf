# ConvLSTM-RAU-net
Spatial-temperal Prediction Model based on history observation and WRF numerical prediction. This is an ideal but unfinished thought. But the time flies, expecting the selected one to finishe it. This project is derived from 2019 Deecamp, relavent conclusions are given in https://blog.csdn.net/maliang_1993/article/details/99622197
