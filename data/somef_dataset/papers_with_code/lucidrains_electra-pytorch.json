It speeds up training (in comparison to normal masked language modeling) by a factor of 4x, and eventually reaches better performance if trained for even longer. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/enijkamp\">Erik Nijkamp</a> for taking the time to replicate the results for GLUE. \nThe generator should be roughly a quarter to at most one half of the discriminator's size for effective training. Any greater and the generator will be too good and the adversarial game collapses. This was done by reducing the hidden dimension, feed forward hidden dimension, and number of attention heads in the paper. \n",
