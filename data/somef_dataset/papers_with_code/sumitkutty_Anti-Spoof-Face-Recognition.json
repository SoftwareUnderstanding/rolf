      "excerpt": "The training is based on deep metric learning. This involves comparing the the embeddings of a face in the stream to the embeddings of all the faces saved during training. The closest estimated face is given as the output.  \nThe training uses the famous ResNet-34 network from the 'Deep Residual Learning of Image Recognition' paper. Albeit, a pre-trained ResNet network with 29 layers and half the filters as the original one was used in the project. \nBasically, the pre-trained model is part of the face_recognition module and can be accessed from there.  \nThe face was detected using a CNN that was part of the face_locations function. \n",
