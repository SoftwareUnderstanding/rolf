    "excerpt": "Contributing Guideline\nWe ove your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and \ntransparent as possible, whether it's:\n* Reporting a bug\n* Discussing current state of the project\n* Submitting a fix\n* Proposing a new feature\n* etc\nWe Develop with GitHub\nWe use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as\naccept pull requests.\nWe use GitHub Flow, so all \ncode changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to \npropose changes to the codebase.\nHow To Contribute\n\nFork the repository and create your branch from main\nCheck out open issues or open your own issue\nIn the case of implementing neural network:\nUse its diagram to have a helicopter view \nRead its paper for more details e.g. number of filters\n\n\nCheck out model summary to make sure whether it is implemented correctly or not\nSubmit your pull request\nIf you are beginner in contributing to open source, use this tutorial  \n\nReporting the Bugs\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs, report a bug by opening a new issue\nGreat bug report tend to have:\n* A quick summary and/or background\n* Steps to reproduce:\n  * Be specific\n  * Give sample code if you can\n* What you expected would happen\n* what actually happens\nCoding Style\nWe use Python PEP-8 style guide, for more details please review this link\nLicense\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be\nunder the same MIT that covers\nthe project.",
