# cat-dog-image-classifier
Learning basics of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification, using Keras. Classifies pictures of either cat or dog. Uses part of dataset provided by https://becominghuman.ai/building-an-image-classifier-using-deep-learning-in-python-totally-from-a-beginners-perspective-be8dbaf22dd8. <br>
Solution is based on the VGG16 CNN (Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman. Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition [https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556]).
