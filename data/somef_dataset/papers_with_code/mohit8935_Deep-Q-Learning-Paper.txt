My Small attempt to solve various DQL papers

Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning

https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf

Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q Learning:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461

Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581

The course is still in review, and this readme is a work in progress. 

Better docs to come!

Currently I am workign on Tutorials: Check out my medium
