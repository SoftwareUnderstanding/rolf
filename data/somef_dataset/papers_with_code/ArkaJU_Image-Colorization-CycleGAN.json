      "excerpt": "Image-to-image  translation  is  a  class  of  vision  and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping \nbetween an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. But for many tasks, paired training data may not be available like this problem of image colorization. This is where the power of CycleGAN becomes apparent. Superiority of CycleGAN has been demonstrated on several tasks where paired training data hardly exist, e.g., in object transfiguration and painting style and season transfer \nGenerative Adversarial Networks(GANs) are composed of two models: \n1. Generator: Aims to generate new data similar to the expected one. The Generator could be related to a human art forger, which creates fake works of art. \n2. Discriminator: It's goal is to recognize if an input data is \u2018real\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200abelongs to the original dataset\u200a\u2014\u200aor if it is \u2018fake\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200agenerated by a forger. In this scenario, a Discriminator is analogous to  an art expert, who tries to detect artworks as truthful or fraud. \nThe CycleGAN consists of 2 generators and discriminators. One generator maps from domain A to B and the other one, from B to A. \n",
