    "excerpt": "Contributing\nI am delighted when people want to contribute to LIME. Here are a few things to keep in mind before sending in a pull request:\n* We are now using flake8 as a style guide enforcer (I plan on adding eslint for javascript soon). Make sure your code passes the default flake8 execution.\n* There must be a really good reason to change the external interfaces - I want to avoid breaking previous code as much as possible.\n* If you are adding a new feature, please let me know the use case and the rationale behind how you did it (unless it's obvious)\nIf you want to contribute but don't know where to start, take a look at the issues page, or at the list below.\nRoadmap\nHere are a few high level features I want to incorporate in LIME. If you want to work incrementally in any of these, feel free to start a branch.\n\nCreating meaningful tests that we can run before merging things. Right now I run the example notebooks and the few tests we have.\nCreating a wrapper that computes explanations for a particular dataset, and suggests instances for the user to look at (similar to what we did in the paper)\nMaking LIME work with images in a reasonable time. The explanations we used in the paper took a few minutes, which is too slow.\nThinking through what is needed to use LIME in regression problems. An obvious problem is that features with different scales make it really hard to interpret.\nFiguring out better alternatives to discretizing the data for tabular data. Discretizing is definitely more interpretable, but we may just want to treat features as continuous.\nFiguring out better ways to sample around a data point for tabular data. One example is sampling columns from the training set assuming independence, or some form of conditional sampling.",

      "excerpt": "This project is about explaining what machine learning classifiers (or models) are doing. \nAt the moment, we support explaining individual predictions for text classifiers or classifiers that act on tables (numpy arrays of numerical or categorical data) or images, with a package called lime (short for local interpretable model-agnostic explanations). \nLime is based on the work presented in this paper (bibtex here for citation).

All we require is that the classifier implements a function that takes in raw text or a numpy array and outputs a probability for each class. Support for scikit-learn classifiers is built-in. \nBelow are some screenshots of lime explanations. These are generated in html, and can be easily produced and embedded in ipython notebooks. We also support visualizations using matplotlib, although they don't look as nice as these ones. \nNegative (blue) words indicate atheism, while positive (orange) words indicate christian. The way to interpret the weights by applying them to the prediction probabilities. For example, if we remove the words Host and NNTP from the document, we expect the classifier to predict atheism with probability 0.58 - 0.14 - 0.11 = 0.31. \n",

      "excerpt": "Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model's behaviour. \nWhile the model may be very complex globally, it is easier to approximate it around the vicinity of a particular instance. \nWhile treating the model as a black box, we perturb the instance we want to explain and learn a sparse linear model around it, as an explanation. \nThe figure below illustrates the intuition for this procedure. The model's decision function is represented by the blue/pink background, and is clearly nonlinear. \nThe bright red cross is the instance being explained (let's call it X). \nWe sample instances around X, and weight them according to their proximity to X (weight here is indicated by size). \nWe then learn a linear model (dashed line) that approximates the model well in the vicinity of X, but not necessarily globally. For more information, read our paper, or take a look at this blog post. \n",
