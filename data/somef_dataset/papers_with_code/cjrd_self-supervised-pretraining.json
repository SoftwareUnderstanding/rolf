Similarity measures will be a seperate PR.\n\n\n\n**Important Notes**:\n* If not using the provided experiment management scripts: add a new config **file** for each base training, even small variations, since the evaluation stage assumes a unique filename for each config (otherwise the checkpoints will overwrite the .previous versions).\n* If not using 4 GPUs, update the learning rate to `new_lr = old_lr * new_ngpus / 4`\n\n\n",
