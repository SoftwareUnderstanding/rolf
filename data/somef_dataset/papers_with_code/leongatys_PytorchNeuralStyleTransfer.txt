# PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer

Code to run Neural Style Transfer from our paper [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html).

Also includes coarse-to-fine high-resolution from our paper [Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07865).

To run the code you need to get the pytorch VGG19-Model from [Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) by running: 

`sh download_models.sh`

Everything else is in the IPythonNotebook `NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb`

Have fun :-)
