      "excerpt": "The visibility of an image captured in poor weather (such as haze, fog, mist, smog) degrades due to scattering of light by atmospheric particles. Single image dehazing (SID) methods are used to restore visibility from a single hazy image. The SID is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature. Typically, the atmospheric scattering model (ATSM) is used to solve SID problem. The transmission and atmospheric light are two prime parameters of ATSM. The accuracy and effectiveness of SID depends on accurate value of transmission and atmospheric light. The proposed method translates transmission estimation problem into estimation of the difference between minimum color channel of hazy and haze-free image. The translated problem presents a lower bound on transmission and is used to minimize reconstruction error in dehazing. The lower bound depends upon the bounding function (BF) and a quality control parameter. A non-linear model is then proposed to estimate BF for accurate estimation of transmission. The proposed quality \ncontrol parameter can be utilized to tune the effect of dehazing.  \nMore details on Non-Linear-Bounding-Function can be found in the paper (or this link) titled as Lower-Bound-on-Transmission-using-Non-Linear-Bounding-Function-in-Single-Image-Dehazing.
