      "excerpt": "We propose a universal building block of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to improve the performance without any inference-time costs. The block is named Diverse Branch Block (DBB), which enhances the representational capacity of a single convolution by combining diverse branches of different scales and complexities to enrich the feature space, including sequences of convolutions, multi-scale convolutions, and average pooling. After training, a DBB can be equivalently converted into a single conv layer for deployment. Unlike the advancements of novel ConvNet architectures, DBB complicates the training-time microstructure while maintaining the macro architecture, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for regular conv layers of any architecture. In this way, the model can be trained to reach a higher level of performance and then transformed into the original inference-time structure for inference. DBB improves ConvNets on image classification (up to 1.9% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet), object detection and semantic segmentation. \n",

      "excerpt": "**Q**: Is the inference-time model's output the _same_ as the training-time model?\n\n**A**: Yes. You can verify that by\n```\npython dbb_verify.py\n```\n\n**Q**: What is the relationship between DBB and RepVGG?\n\n**A**: RepVGG is a plain architecture, and the RepVGG-style structural re-param is designed for the plain architecture. On a non-plain architecture, a RepVGG block shows no superiority compared to a single 3x3 conv (it improves Res-50 by only 0.03%, as reported in the RepVGG paper). DBB is a universal building block that can be used on numerous architectures.\n\n**Q**: How to quantize a model with DBB?\n\n**A1**: Post-training quantization. After training and conversion, you may quantize the converted model with any post-training quantization method. Then you may insert a BN after the conv converted from a DBB and finetune to recover the accuracy just like you quantize and finetune the other models. This is the recommended solution. Please see the quantization example of [RepVGG](https://github.com/DingXiaoH/RepVGG).\n\n**A2**: Quantization-aware training. During the quantization-aware training, instead of constraining the params in a single kernel (e.g., making every param in {-127, -126, .., 126, 127} for int8) for an ordinary conv, you should constrain the equivalent kernel of a DBB (get_equivalent_kernel_bias()). \n\n**Q**: I tried to finetune your model with multiple GPUs but got an error. Why are the names of params like \"xxxx.weight\" in the downloaded weight file but sometimes like \"module.xxxx.weight\" (shown by nn.Module.named_parameters()) in my model?\n\n**A**: DistributedDataParallel may prefix \"module.\" to the name of params and cause a mismatch when loading weights by name. The simplest solution is to load the weights (model.load_state_dict(...)) before DistributedDataParallel(model). Otherwise, you may insert \"module.\" before the names like this\n```\ncheckpoint = torch.load(...)    #: This is just a name-value dict\nckpt = {('module.' + k) : v for k, v in checkpoint.items()}\nmodel.load_state_dict(ckpt)\n```\nLikewise, if the param names in the checkpoint file start with \"module.\" but those in your model do not, you may strip the names like\n```\nckpt = {k.replace('module.', ''):v for k,v in checkpoint.items()}   #: strip the names\nmodel.load_state_dict(ckpt)\n```\n**Q**: So a DBB derives the equivalent KxK kernels before each forwarding to save computations?\n\n**A**: No! More precisely, we do the conversion only once right after training. Then the training-time model can be discarded, and every resultant block is just a KxK conv. We only save and use the resultant model.\n\n\n",

For the ease of transfer learning on other tasks, we provide both training-time and inference-time models. For ResNet-18 as an example, assume IMGNET_PATH is the path to your directory that contains the \"train\" and \"val\" directories of ImageNet, you may test the accuracy by running\n```\npython test.py IMGNET_PATH train ResNet-18_DBB_7101.pth -a ResNet-18 -t DBB\n```\nHere \"train\" indicates the training-time structure\n\n\n",

Then SomeModel will be like\n```\nclass SomeModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        ...\n        self.some_dbb = DiverseBranchBlock(..., deploy=False)\n        ...\n        \n    def forward(self, inputs):\n        out = ...\n        out = self.some_dbb(out)\n        ...\n```\nTrain the model just like you train the other regular models. Then call **switch_to_deploy** of every DiverseBranchBlock, test, and save.\n```\nmodel = SomeModel(...)\ntrain(model)\nfor m in train_model.modules():\n    if hasattr(m, 'switch_to_deploy'):\n        m.switch_to_deploy()\ntest(model)\nsave(model)\n```\n\n",
