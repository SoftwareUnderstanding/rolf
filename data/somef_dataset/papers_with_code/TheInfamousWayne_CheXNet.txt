# CheXNet-with-localization


## Weakly supervised localization :
In this task, we have to plot bounding boxes for each disease finding in a single chest X-ray without goundtruth (X, Y, width, height) in training set. The workflow is shown below:
### Workflow :
![Alt Text](https://github.com/theinfamouswayne/CheXNet/blob/master/output/process_flow.png)
1) Predict findings
2) Use the classifier to plot heatmap (Grad-CAM)
3) Plot the bounding box base on Grad-CAM
### Package : 
`Pytorch==0.2.0` &nbsp; `torchvision==0.2.0` &nbsp;` matplotlib`  &nbsp;` scikit-image==0.13.1` &nbsp;` opencv_python==3.4.0.12` &nbsp;` numpy==1.13.3` &nbsp;`matplotlib==2.1.1` &nbsp;`scipy==1.0.0` &nbsp; `sklearn==0.19.1` &nbsp;

### Environment:
* OS: Linux
* Python 3.5
* GPU: 1080 Ti
* CPU: Xeon(R) E5-2667 v4
* RAM: 500 GB
### Experiments process:
1) preprocessing:
```
python3 preprocessing.py [path of images folder] [path to data_entry] [path to bbox_list_path] [path to train_txt] [path to valid_txt] [path of preprocessed output (folder)]
```

2) training:
```
python3 train.py [path of preprocessed output (folder)]
```

3) local testing:
```
python3 denseNet_localization.py [path to test.txt] [path of images folder]
```
4) Output txt format: <br>
After running denseNet_localization.py, you would get a txt file. The format is shown below:<br>
```
[image_path] [number_of_detection]
[disease] [x] [y] [width] [height]
[disease] [x] [y] [width] [height]
...
[image_path] [number_of_detection]
[disease] [x] [y] [width] [height]
[disease] [x] [y] [width] [height]
...
```
------
For DeepQ platform testing:

upload **deepQ_25.zip** to the platform. Then use following command:
```
python3 inference.py
```

### Note :
In our .py script, I used the following script to assign the task running on GPU 0.<br>

```
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = "0"
```
