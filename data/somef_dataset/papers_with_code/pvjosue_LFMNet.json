LFMNet is a neural network that reconstructs a 3D confocal volume given a 4D LF image, it has been tested with the Mice Brain LFM-confocal public dataset. \nLFMNet is fully convolutional, it can be trained with LFs of any size (for example patches) and then tested on other sizes. \nIn our case it takes 20ms to reconstruct a volume with 1287x1287x64 voxels. \n",

      "excerpt": "The paradigm behind this network is that the input contains a group of microlenses and a neighborhood around them, and reconstructs the 3D volume behind the central microlenses. \n  LFMNet has as an initial layer a conv4d, that ensures a fully convolutional network, this first layers traverses every lenslet, and grabs a neighborhood (9 lenses in our case) around. Then the output is converted to a 2D image with the number of channels equal to the number of depths to reconstruct. Lastly, this tensor goes into a U-net<sup>1</sup>, which finishes up the feature extraction and 3D reconstution. \n",
