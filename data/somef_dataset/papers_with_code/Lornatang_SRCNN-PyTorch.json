The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) \nthat takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods \ncan also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes \nall layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical \non-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend \nour network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality. \n",
