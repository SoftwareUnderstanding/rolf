    "excerpt": "How to contribute to fastai\nFirst, thanks a lot for wanting to help! Make sure you have read the doc on code style first. (Note that we don't follow PEP8, but instead follow a coding style designed specifically for numerical and interactive programming.) For help running and building the code, see the developers guide.\nNote for new contributors from Jeremy\nIt can be tempting to jump into a new project by questioning the stylistic decisions that have been made, such as naming, formatting, and so forth. This can be especially so for python programmers contributing to this project, which is unusual in following a number of conventions that are common in other programming communities, but not in Python. However, please don\u2019t do this, for (amongst others) the following reasons:\n\nContributing to Parkinson\u2019s law of triviality has negative consequences for a project. Let\u2019s focus on deep learning!\nIt\u2019s exhausting to repeat the same discussion over and over again, especially when it\u2019s been well documented already. When you have a question about the project, please check the pages in the docs website linked here.\nYou\u2019re likely to get a warmer welcome from the community if you start out by contributing something that\u2019s been requested on the forum, since you\u2019ll be solving someone\u2019s current problem.\nIf you start out by just telling us your point of view, rather than studying the background behind the decisions that have been made, you\u2019re unlikely to be contributing anything new or useful.\nI\u2019ve been writing code for nearly 40 years now, across dozens of languages, and other folks involved have quite a bit of experience too - the approaches used are based on significant experience and research. Whilst there\u2019s always room for improvement, it\u2019s much more likely you\u2019ll be making a positive contribution if you spend a few weeks studying and working within the current framework before suggesting wholesale changes.\n\nHow to get started\nHere are some ways that you can learn a lot about the library, whilst also contributing to the community:\n\nPick a class, function, or method and write tests for it. For instance, here are the tests for fastai.core. Adding tests for anything without good test coverage is a great way to really understand that part of the library deeply, and have in-depth conversations with the dev team about the reasoning behind decisions in the code.\nDocument something that is currently undocumented. You can find them by looking for the \u201cnew methods\u201d section in any doc notebook. Here\u2019s a search that lists them\nAdd an example of use to the docs for something that doesn\u2019t currently have an example of use. We\u2019d like everything soon in the docs to include an actual piece of working code demonstrating it. Currently, we\u2019ve largely only provided working examples for stuff higher up the abstraction ladder.\n\nDid you find a bug?\n\nNobody is perfect, especially not us. But first, please double-check the bug doesn't come from something on your side. The forum is a tremendous source for help, and we'd advise to use it as a first step. Be sure to include as much code as you can so that other people can easily help you.\nThen, ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.\nIf you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\nBe sure to add the complete error messages as well as the result of the line import fastai.utils.collect_env; fastai.utils.collect_env.show_install(1).\n\nDid you write a patch that fixes a bug?\n\nOpen a new GitHub pull request with the patch.\nEnsure that your PR includes tests that fail without your patch, and pass with it.\nEnsure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.\nBefore submitting, please be sure you abide by our coding style and the guide on abbreviations and clean-up your code accordingly.\n\nDo you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?\nPlease take note that we are in the midst of making several breaking changes with the preparation of v1.1 so we suggest you wait a little bit before starting coding it.\n\nYou can suggest your change on the fastai forum to see if others are interested or want to help. This topic lists the features that will be added to fastai in the foreseeable future. Be sure to read it too!\nBefore implementing a non-trivial new feature, first create a notebook version of your new feature, like those in dev_nb. It should show step-by-step what your code is doing, and why, with the result of each step. Try to simplify the code as much as possible. When you're happy with it, let us know on the forum (include a link to gist with your notebook.)\nOnce your approach has been discussed and confirmed on the forum, you are welcome to push a PR, including a complete description of the new feature and an example of how it's used. Be sure to document your code and read the doc on code style and the one on abbreviations.\nEnsure that your PR includes tests that exercise not only your feature, but also any other code that might be impacted. Currently we have poor test coverage of existing features, so often you'll need to add tests of existing code. Your help here is much appreciated!\n\nHow to submit notebook PRs?\nPlease run nbdev_install_git_hooks in your terminal after cloning the repository. This sets up git hooks, which clean up the notebooks to remove the extraneous stuff stored in the notebooks (e.g. which cells you ran) which causes unnecessary merge conflicts.\nBefore submitting a PR, check that the local library and notebooks match. The script nbdev_diff_nbs can let you know if there is a difference between the local library and the notebooks.\nIf you made a change to the notebooks in one of the exported cells, you can export it to the library with nbdev_build_lib or make fastai.\nIf you made a change to the library, you can export it back to the notebooks with nbdev_update_lib.\nFurthermore, you can run tests in parallel by launching nbdev_test_nbs or make test\nPR submission guidelines\n\n\nKeep each PR focused. While it's more convenient, do not combine several unrelated fixes together. Create as many branches as needing to keep each PR focused.\n\n\nDo not mix style changes/fixes with \"functional\" changes. It's very difficult to review such PRs and it most likely get rejected.\n\n\nDo not add/remove vertical whitespace. Preserve the original style of the file you edit as much as you can.\n\n\nDo not turn an already submitted PR into your development playground. If after you submitted PR, you discovered that more work is needed - close the PR, do the required work and then submit a new PR. Otherwise each of your commits requires attention from maintainers of the project.\n\n\nIf, however, you submitted a PR and received a request for changes, you should proceed with commits inside that PR, so that the maintainer can see the incremental fixes and won't need to review the whole PR again. In the exception case where you realize it'll take many many commits to complete the requests, then it's probably best to close the PR, do the work and then submit it again. Use common sense where you'd choose one way over another.\n\n\nCode PRs\n\n\nIf your PR is a bug fix, please also include a test that demonstrates the problem, or modifies an existing test that wasn't catching that problem already. Of course, it's not a requirement, so proceed anyway if you can't figure out how to write a test, but do try. Without having a test your fix could be lost down the road. By supplying a test, you're ensuring that your projects won't break in the future.\n\n\nSame applies for PRs that implement new features - without having a test case validating this new feature, it'd be very easy for that new feature to break in the future. A test case ensures that the feature will not break.\n\n\nDo you have questions about the source code?\n\nPlease ask it on the fastai forum (after searching someone didn't ask the same one before with a quick search). We'd rather have the maximum of discussions there so that the largest number can benefit from it.\n\nDo you want to contribute to the documentation?\n\nDocs are automatically created from the notebooks in the /nbs directory.\nTo switch the docs submodule to ssh, cd docs &amp;&amp; git remote set-url origin git@github.com:fastai/fastai-docs.git",

      "excerpt": "The best way to get started with fastai (and deep learning) is to read the book, and complete the free course. \nTo see what's possible with fastai, take a look at the Quick Start, which shows how to use around 5 lines of code to build an image classifier, an image segmentation model, a text sentiment model, a recommendation system, and a tabular model. For each of the applications, the code is much the same. \nRead through the Tutorials to learn how to train your own models on your own datasets. Use the navigation sidebar to look through the fastai documentation. Every class, function, and method is documented here. \nTo learn about the design and motivation of the library, read the peer reviewed paper. \nfastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: \n",

In fact, every page of this documentation is also available as an interactive notebook - click \"Open in colab\" at the top of any page to open it (be sure to change the Colab runtime to \"GPU\" to have it run fast!) See the fast.ai documentation on [Using Colab](https://course.fast.ai/start_colab) for more information.\n\nYou can install fastai on your own machines with conda (highly recommended), as long as you're running Linux or Windows (NB: Mac is not supported). For Windows, please see the \"Running on Windows\" for important notes.\n\nIf you're using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) then run (note that if you replace `conda` with [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) the install process will be much faster and more reliable):\n```bash\nconda install -c fastchan fastai\n```\n\n...or if you're using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) then run:\n```bash\nconda install -c fastchan fastai anaconda\n```\n\nTo install with pip, use: `pip install fastai`. If you install with pip, you should install PyTorch first by following the PyTorch [installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n\nIf you plan to develop fastai yourself, or want to be on the cutting edge, you can use an editable install (if you do this, you should also use an editable install of [fastcore](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore) to go with it.) First install PyTorch, and then:\n\n``` \ngit clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai\npip install -e \"fastai[dev]\"\n``` \n\n",

We have seen a few bugs in PyTorch's subclassing feature, however, so please file an issue if you see any code failing now which was working before.\n\nThere is one breaking change in this version of fastai, which is that custom metadata is now stored directly in tensors as standard python attributes, instead of in the special `_meta` attribute. Only advanced customization of fastai OO tensors would have used this functionality, so if you do not know what this all means, then it means you did not use it.",

Therefore, we recommend pinning your fastai version to `<2.1` if you are not able to fully test your fastai code when the new version comes out.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- pin pytorch (`<1.7`) and torchvision (`<0.8`) requirements ([#2915](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2915))\n- Add version pin for fastcore\n- Remove version pin for sentencepiece",

It should not require any code changes except for people doing sophisticated tensor subclassing work, but nonetheless we recommend testing carefully. Therefore, we recommend pinning your fastai version to `<2.1` if you are not able to fully test your fastai code when the new version comes out.\n\n### New Features\n\n- pin pytorch (`<1.7`) and torchvision (`<0.8`) requirements ([#2915](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2915))",

It's useful for initial setup which isn't needed for every `fit`, but just once for each `Learner` (such as setting initial defaults).\n\n- Modified XResNet to support Conv1d / Conv3d ([#2744](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2744)), thanks to [@floleuerer](https://github.com/floleuerer)\n  - Supports different input dimensions, kernel sizes and stride (added parameters ndim, ks, stride). Tested with fastai_audio and fastai time series with promising results.\n\n### Bugs Squashed\n\n- `img_size` attribute for `TensorPoint` is not updated properly ([#2799](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2799)), thanks to [@IRailean](https://github.com/IRailean)",

This makes tasks such as computer vision in Jupyter on Windows many times slower than on Linux. This limitation doesn't exist if you use fastai from a script.\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/nbs/examples/dataloader_spawn.py) to fully leverage the fastai API on Windows.\n\n",
