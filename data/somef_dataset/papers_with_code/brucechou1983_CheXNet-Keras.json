As described in the paper, a 121-layer densely connected convolutional neural network is trained on ChestX-ray14 dataset, which contains 112,120 frontal view X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. The result is so good that it surpasses the performance of practicing radiologists. If you are new to this project, Luke Oakden-Rayner's post is highly recommended. \n",

Run python test.py to evaluate your model on the test set. \n7. Run python cam.py to generate images with class activation mapping overlay and the ground bbox.
