      "excerpt": "In this project, we release code for VoVNet-v2 backbone network (introduced by CenterMask) in detectron2 as a extention form. \nVoVNet can  extract diverse feature representation efficiently by using One-Shot Aggregation (OSA) module that concatenates subsequent layers at once. Since the OSA module can capture multi-scale receptive fields, the diversifed feature maps allow object detection and segmentation to address multi-scale objects and pixels well, especially robust on small objects. VoVNet-v2 improves VoVNet-v1 by adding identity mapping that eases the optimization problem and effective SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) that enhances the diversified feature representation. \nCompared to ResNe(X)t backbone \n",
