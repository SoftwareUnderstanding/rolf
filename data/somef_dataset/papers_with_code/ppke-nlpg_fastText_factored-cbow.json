    "excerpt": "Contributing to fastText\nWe want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.\nIssues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\nReproducing issues\nPlease make sure that the issue you mention is not a result of one of the existing third-party libraries. For example, please do not post an issue if you encountered an error within a third-party Python library. We can only help you with errors which can be directly reproduced either with our C++ code or the corresponding Python bindings. If you do find an error, please post detailed steps to reproduce it. If we can't reproduce your error, we can't help you fix it.\nPull Requests\nPlease post an Issue before submitting a pull request. This might save you some time as it is possible we can't support your contribution, albeit we try our best to accomodate your (planned) work and highly appreciate your time. Generally, it is best to have a pull request emerge from an issue rather than the other way around.\nTo create a pull request:\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from master.\nIf you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\nIf you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code lints.\nIf you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\").\n\nTests\nFirst, you will need to make sure you have the required data. For that, please have a look at the fetch_test_data.sh script under tests. Next run the tests using the runtests.py script passing a path to the directory containing the datasets.\nContributor License Agreement (\"CLA\")\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need\nto do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.\nComplete your CLA here: https://code.facebook.com/cla\nLicense\nBy contributing to fastText, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its BSD license.",
