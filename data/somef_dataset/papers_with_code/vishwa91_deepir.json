      "excerpt": "Deep InfraRed image processing framework \nThermal images captured by uncooled microbolometer cameras suffer from non-uniform noise that leads to severe loss in spatial resolution. We identify that thermal images can be factored into a scene-dependent flux that is concisely modeled as outputs of deep networks, and a scene-independent and slowly varying non-uniformity. By capturing multiple images with small camera motion, we are able to estimate the high quality thermal image. \n",

For example, if you want to run a simulation, the set of variables should be:\n```python\nimname = 'test1'\ncamera = 'sim'\nscale_sr = 1        #: Set scale to 1 for denoising, higher integers\n                    #: for super resolution\nnimg = 5            #: Number of input images. For denoising, 3 - 5 suffice,\n                    #: but for super resolution, you may need more.\n````\n- We have provided default configuration files in `configs/`, you may edit them as you see fit.\n\n",
