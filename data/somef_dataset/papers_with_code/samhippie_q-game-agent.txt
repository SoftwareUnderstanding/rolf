agent.py is a q-learning implementation using tensorflow.
It doesn't really work.
See [http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/slides/lec-8.pdf](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/slides/lec-8.pdf)

mcts.py is an AlphaZero-style MCTS-based learning system also using tensorflow.
I have no idea if it works.
