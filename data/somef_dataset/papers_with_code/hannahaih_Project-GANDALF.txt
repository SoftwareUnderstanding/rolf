## About:

Gandalf is a long term interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) project and pet-GAN (GAN architecture based on “Generative Adversarial Networks” [arXiv:1406.2661](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf)) by Hannah Reber.

Written and trained to explore the latent space of her own intrinsic artistic process and intuition, Hannah was the first art teacher of Gandalf. She developed a co-creative process to support the artistic development of Gandalf. Since Gandalf's first exhibition in July 2020 more collaborations with other human artists followed.
