      "excerpt": "Understanding how people walk around in a space is useful. Knowing how customers explore a retail stores reveals the most or least visited area, so that the store owner can improve store layouts and staff placement. Knowing how pedestrian walk through public spaces helps identify points of congestion and possible barrier of evacuation. Security camera videos provide useful data for such analysis. Computer vision AI made it possible to simply analyze videos and extract pedestrian trajectories, without the need to attach any tracking device to people. Video analytics is projected to increase in market size from $1.1 billion in 2018 to $4.5 billion in 2025 (report by Tractica).  With both increased market demands and advances in object-tracking AI algorithms, more and more machine learning solution providers are offering pedestrian tracking services to meet clients' needs. \n",

The trajectories can be projected to 2D floor plan for detailed spatial flow analyses. All the underlying analyses are automatically triggered by the video upload, and are processed using the serverless AWS Fargate. Data scientists and developers can experiment with different versions of computer vision models and pre- and post-processing scripts (with SageMaker Experiments, Debugger), save them as model checkpoints (in S3) and Docker Image (in AWS ECR), and easily deploy them on the Fargate service. \n",

Here I use the gluoncv implementation of the YOLOv3 model. \n- Use a Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm that identify people's trajectories based only on locations of the positive detection bounding boxes. This approach does not require learning about each person's appearance (e.g. color of cloth) and is easy to implement (with just one .py script, using implementation of (abewley/sort)). The algorithm offers multiple parameters for fine-tuning; for example, how many consecutive frames do we allow a person to be missing, and the threshold of box overlap for declaring a match.  \n",

People who walk in groups sometimes got their ID swapped. It is not surprising, because the YOLOv3 model used here is the 'vanilla' version based on ResNet-34 backbone, with no configuration for tackling occlusion, scaling (people further away is smaller) and deformation (people may change posture).

      "excerpt": "The FairMOT model does a much better job. Occlusion problem is reasonably resolved. Although sometimes the same person is 'flashing' and keep being assigned new ID, it is much easier to fix on trajectory maps compared to the swapping problem above.  \nThere are at least three reasons for the model's good performance: 1) it uses a deformable convolution network with deep layer aggregation backbone (DLA-34), which handles scaling and deformation better than YOLOv3-ResNet34; 2) explicit learning of each person's appearance greatly improved re-identification during tracking; 3) the model was pre-trained on multi-object detection datasets, allowing effective application into our use case.  \nIt is fascinating that the FairMOT model does quite well on a video clip it never saw before. In practice, a better performance can be expected after formally trained and fine-tuned the model on training data set of the same camera. Our MLOps architecture makes it easier to do so, and to deploy improved model checkpoints into production. \nProject pedestrian trajectories onto 2D floor plans. \n",
