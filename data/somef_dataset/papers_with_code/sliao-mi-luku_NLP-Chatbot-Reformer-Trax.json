Instead of using a pre-trained model, I trained the chatbot **from scratch**\n\n2. Instead of using `trax.supervised.decoding.autoregressive_sample_stream`, I used a helper function to continue the conversation token by token.\n\n3. I cleaned up and rewrited the part of model evaluation. The model can be used to predict on the test dataset, or any custom starter sentence.\n\n**The Reformer paper**\n\nN.
