# pytorch-computer-vision-tutorial

This repertoire is a tutorial for first-time users of Pythorch. It consists of classification, expression, object detection, and gan.  

### Classification referred to the following paper.
[VGG] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)  
Create a directory called dataset in the directory called classification, then insert data into the directory named for the objects.  

### The semantic segmentation referred to the following paper.
[U-net] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)

### The object detection referred to the following paper.
[R-CNN] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf)

### Gan referred to the following paper.
[gan] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)

Only classifications are implemented at present, but we plan to complete them gradually.
