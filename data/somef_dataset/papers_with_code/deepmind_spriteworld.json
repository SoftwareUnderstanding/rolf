      "excerpt": "Spriteworld is a python-based RL environment that consists of a 2-dimensional\narena with simple shapes that can be moved freely. This environment was\ndeveloped for the COBRA agent introduced in the paper [\"COBRA: Data-Efficient\nModel-Based RL through Unsupervised Object Discovery and Curiosity-Driven\nExploration\" (Watters et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09275). The\nmotivation for the environment was to provide as much flexibility for\nprocedurally generating multi-object scenes while retaining as simple an\ninterface as possible.\n\nSpriteworld sprites come in a variety of shapes and can vary continuously in\nposition, size, color, angle, and velocity. The environment has occlusion but no\nphysics, so by default sprites pass beneath each other but do not collide or\ninteract in any way. Interactions may be introduced through the action space,\nwhich can update all sprites each timestep. For example, the DiscreteEmbodied\naction space (see `spriteworld/action_spaces.py`) implements a rudimentary form\nof physics in which an agent's body sprite can adhere to and carry sprites\nunderneath it.\n\nThere are a variety of action spaces, some of which are continuous (like a\ntouch-screen) and others of which are discrete (like an embodied agent that\ntakes discrete steps).\n\n",

E.g. \"square\" was rotated as a diamond, it is now axis-aligned.\r\n2. Modified Rendering orientation. Everything is now using (bottom-left) as the (0, 0) origin, even the pixel rendering. This makes everything self-consistent (actions, sprite positions, renders and transformations), but might require you to remove transposes/origin='lower' from your code.\r\n3. There was too much default action noise injected in the COBRA configs, which meant that clicking on an object would be ~impossible for an agent. This has been reverted.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce COBRA results while training a transition model, consider adding some noise in the velocity components only, see Appendix for details.",

The agent must arrange the sprites into clusters according to\ntheir color.\n\n![clustering_video](./gifs/clustering_video.gif)\n\nSorting task. The agent must sort the sprites into goal locations according\nto their color (each color is associated with a different goal location).\n\n![sorting_video](./gifs/sorting_video.gif)\n\n",

There\nare a number of tasks specified in the `spriteworld/configs` directory, each of\nwhich can be run with the demo by modifying the `--config` flag. Note that some\ntasks (namely `spriteworld.configs.examples.goal_finding_embodied`) use an\nembodied agent instead of the drag-and-drop action space.\n\n",
