# Python RL

This repository serves as a home for my work and experiments on reinforcement learning algos.

## Lunar Lander
The [ppo lunar lander](https://github.com/FMArduini/python-rl/blob/master/LunarLanderPPO%20(v1).ipynb) is my own tensorflow implemetation of the PPO algorithm.

## Snake

Created my own environment for snake [gym-snake] as a gym registered environment. Solved with stable baselines.

# NEAT

Neat is an evolutionary algorithm that evolves neural networks.
