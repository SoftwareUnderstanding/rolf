      "excerpt": "Certainly, GPU saves a lot of time training neural networks, so I had to spend some time to setup a virtual machine in Google Cloud to have access to GPU computing. Given that I didn't find a compehensive tutorial for Windows users, I will share what worked for me.\n\n1\\. To setup my virtual machine in Google Cloud, I borrowed a virtual machine image from Stanford\u2019s Convolutional Neural Networks course that installs Anaconda, Pytorch and other useful libraries (thanks guys!). I followed this tutorial: http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/ . <p></p>\nBe careful to select the number of GPUs that you need in order to have access to GPU computing. In my case, I selected 1 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image1-1.png\"</p>\n \nAfter finishing the setup of your virtual machine you will get an error message because you don\u2019t have a GPU quota assigned to your virtual machine. \n\nTo solve this, you have to go IAM & admin->Quotas in the Google Cloud console, find and select the NVIDIA K80 GPU of your corresponding zone, click \u201cEDIT QUOTAS\u201d and then request access to the number of GPUs that you selected previously (1 in my case).\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image1-2.png\"</p>\n \nIn my case, it took almost 24 hours to get my quota increased. After that, you are ready to go with your virtual machine!\n \n2\\. Following the previous tutorial, it is important that you open the terminal:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image2-1.png\"</p>\n \nand make sure to run the following command for the first time setup:\n \n    $ /home/shared/setup.sh && source ~/.bashrc\n\n3\\. Install PuTTY to generate a private key: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html\n\n4\\. Open PuTTY key generator and create a private key: \n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image4-1.png\"</p>\n \nMake sure to put your Google Cloud username in \u201cKey comment\u201d. After this, save the private key (I saved the key in a file named gcloud_instance_2.ppk)\n\n5\\. Go to the virtual machine in the Google Cloud console, make sure it is stopped, and click it:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image5-1.png\"</p>\n \nThen click \u201cEDIT\u201d:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image5-2.png\"</p>\n \nAnd go to SSH Keys and click \u201cAdd item\u201d then copy and paste the key generated in the previous step: \n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image5-3.png\"</p>\n \nFinally, save changes:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image5-4.png\"</p>\n \n6\\. Download WinSCP: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php to transfer files between local and virtual machine.\n\nTo connect, use the external IP of the instance, the user name (prodillo) and in Advanced Settings->SSH-> Authenticate, select the private key file created in the previous step.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image6-1.png\"</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/prodillo/GAN_project/blob/master/gcloud_tutorial/image6-2.png\"</p>\n \n7\\. Finally, if you need to install python libraries, open  a SSH terminal as shown in step 2 and type:\n\n    $ sudo su root\n    \n    $ conda install [package name]\n\nFor example, I installed the tqdm package typing:\n\n    $ conda install tqdm\n",
