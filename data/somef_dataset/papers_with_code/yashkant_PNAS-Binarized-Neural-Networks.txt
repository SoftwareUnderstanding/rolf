# Progressive Neural Architecture Search with Binarized Neural Networks

**This project combines the architecture search strategy from [Progressive Neural Architecture Search][1] with the search space of [Binarized Neural Networks][2].** 



Introduction
------------
Neural Architecture Search is a sub-field of AutoML which has recently gained popularity for generating state-of-the-art architectures on various tasks of Image Processing and Natural Language Processing. 


Progressive Neural Architecture Search searches through the space in a sequential fashion starting with simplest models and increasing the complexity as it proceeds. It learns a surrogate reward predictor implemented as a RNN to reduce the overhead of training every proposed architecture.

Binarized Neural Networks with binary weights and activations at run-time drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations which substantially improve power-efficiency. Both the weights and the activations are constrained to either +1 or -1. 

Binarization function used in the experiment is deterministic binary-tanh which is placed in [```binary_ops.py```][3]. 


Setup Dependencies
-----
The recommended version for running the experiments is Python3.

1. Follow the installation guide on [Tensorflow Homepage][4] for installing Tensorflow-GPU or Tensorflow-CPU. 
2. Follow instructions outlined on [Keras Homepage][5] for installing Keras.

Run a vanilla experiment using the following command at the directory root folder. 
```bash 
python train.py
```

```


Defining Experiment Configuration 
---------------------------------

#### Architecture Search

To run the architecture search experiment you can edit the following sections of [```train.py```][7] file. 
 

```bash
# -------Controller Training Settings-------
B = 3   # Maximum number of block in the cell
K_ = 128  # Number of children to be trained for each block size
REGULARIZATION = 0  # Regularization strength on RNN controller
CONTROLLER_CELLS = 100  # Number of cells in RNN controller
RNN_TRAINING_EPOCHS = 15 # Number of training epochs during each run of the encoder training
RESTORE_CONTROLLER = True  # Restore a pre-trained controller from earlier run 
# ------------------------------------------


# ------- Common Settings --------
DROP_INPUT = 0.2  # Dropout parameter for the input layer
DROP_HIDDEN = 0.5  # Dropout parameter for the hidden dense layers
DROPOUT= (False, DROP_INPUT, DROP_HIDDEN) # Dropout only applied to the dense layers and the input
MAX_EPOCHS = 20  # Maximum number of epochs to train each child network
BATCHSIZE = 128  # Batchsize while training child networks
NUM_CELLS = 3 # No. of cells to stack in each architecture
NUM_CELL_FILTERS = [16, 24, 32] # No. of filters in each cell
DENSE_LAYERS = [32, 10] # No. of neurons in the final dense layers
USE_EXPANSION = False # If true uses expanded MNIST with data augmentation and rotation 
operators = ['3x3 sep-bconv','5x5 sep-bconv', '1x7-7x1 bconv',
              '3x3 bconv']  # Defines set of possible operations in the search space
# --------------------------------

```

You can add the following operations inside the operators array above to grow the search space. 

````bash 
operators = ['3x3 sep-bconv','5x5 sep-bconv', '7x7 sep-bconv','3x3 bconv', '5x5 bconv',
              '7x7 bconv', '1x7-7x1 bconv', '3x3 maxpool', '3x3 avgpool', 'linear' ]
````
These operations are defined in [```pnas/model.py```][6] file you can add your custom operations there. 

Use the following command to run the experiment finally. 

```bash 
python train.py
```


#### Analyzing Output 

All the trained architectures are stored in ```architectures/{EXPERIMENT_NAME}.txt ``` file. The output for an architecture will be logged as follows: 

```bash
Sr. No: 1
Reward: 0.4846  # Defines the reward/accuracy 
Architecture: [0, '3x3 sep-bconv', 0, '3x3 sep-bconv']  # Architecture Specification 
Representation String: "[[1. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0. 0.]]"  # This will be used for training architectures till convergence
```
The architecture with highest reward needs to be trained till convergence, follow the steps below for it. 


#### Training Architecture  

To train an architecture till convergence edit the following section of [```train.py```][7] file. Pick the required architecture's representation string (see above) from the output and replace the corresponding field below with it. 

```bash

# -------Architecture Training Settings-----
NUM_EPOCHS = 200  # Define the number of epochs.
REPRESENTATION_STRING = "[[1. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0.]] [[1. 0. 0. 0.]]"  # Replace this string with the architecture representation string required
LOAD_SAVED = False # Set this to true to continue training a saved architecture 
# ------------------------------------------

```
After replacing the ```REPRESENTATION_STRING``` run the following command:

```bash

python train.py -ta True

```
