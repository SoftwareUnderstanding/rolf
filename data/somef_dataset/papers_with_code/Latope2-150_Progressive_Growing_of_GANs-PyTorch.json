      "excerpt": "A PyTorch implementation of \"Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability and Variability\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) compatible with PyTorch 0.4. \nThe growing of the GAN is based on a progress parameter p that increases during training. This parameter drives the sizes of input and output of the generator and the discriminator. \nThe equalized learning rate is achieved by the WScaleLayer that mutliplies the input of the convolution by the normalization constant from He's initializer instead of modifying the convolution weights. \nThe networks input and output resolutions depend on the maxRes parameter: the images will be square of resolution 4 * 2^(maxRes): maxRes=0 -> 4x4, maxRes=1 -> 8x8, ..., maxRes=8 -> 1024x1024 \n",
