      "excerpt": "Aug 16, 2021: Release of models and results for IWSLT 2021 offline ST and simultaneous translation task. \nJune 15, 2021: Integration of LightSeq for training speedup, see the experimental branch. \nMarch 28, 2021: The v0.1.1 release includes the instructions of weight pruning and quantization aware training for transformer models, and several more features. See the release note for more details. \nDec. 25, 2020: The v0.1.0 release includes the overall design of the code structure and recipes for training end-to-end ST models. See the release note for more details. \nProduction ready: The model trained by NeurST can be directly exported as TF savedmodel format and use TensorFlow-serving. There is no gap between the research model and production model. Additionally, one can use LightSeq for NeurST model serving with a much lower latency. \nLight weight: NeurST is designed specifically for end-to-end ST and NMT models, with clean and simple code. It has no dependency on Kaldi, which simplifies installation and usage. \nExtensibility and scalability: NeurST has the careful design for extensibility and scalability. It allows users to customize Model, Task, Dataset etc. and combine each other. \nHigh computation efficiency: NeurST has high computation efficiency and can be further optimized by enabling mixed-precision and XLA. Fast distributed training using Byteps / Horovod is also supported for large-scale scenarios. \nReliable and reproducible benchmarks: NeurST reports strong baselines with well-designed hyper-parameters on several benchmark datasets (MT&ST). It provides a series of recipes to reproduce them. \nNeurST provides reference implementations of various models and benchmarks. Please see examples for model links and NeurST benchmark on different datasets. \n",
