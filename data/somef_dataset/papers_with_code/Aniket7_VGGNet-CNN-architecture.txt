# VGGNet-CNN-architecture
It's a convolutional neural network architecture, was first introduced by Simonyan and Zisserman in their 2014 paper, Very Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition

You can find this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf here.

I designed and created a small version of VGG like convolutional neural network architecture from scratch using TensorFlow & Keras.
then I trained this network on CIFAR-10 dataset.

Also, I attached accuracy and loss curve with or without using Batch Normalization.

Note : it contain two driver files,
1. File with the name vggnet_cifar10_tf.py is the driver script for tensorflow CNN version.

2. File with the name vggnet_cifar10.py is the driver script for Keras CNN version.
