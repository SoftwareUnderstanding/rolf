# Segmentation of Traffic Objects

Multi-object segmentation on traffic elements.


**Important!**

This is a simple project for visualization purposes only.

## Contributions

1. The authors of the ENet - A. Paszke, A. Chaurasia, S. Kim, E. Culurciello (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147)

2. Adrian Rosebrock at PyImageSearch (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)

## Installation

1. Python3
2. OpenCV (at least 3.4.8)
3. NumPy
4. mutils (https://pypi.org/project/mutils/)


Using virtual enviromnets is recommended.

## Running

The code can be run on Jupyter Notebook.

The input images should be put within the folder ./images

## Additional Information

The ENet work has been published in arXiv: ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation.

The ENet can be trained by yourself. You can find a tutorial here (https://github.com/TimoSaemann/ENet/tree/master/Tutorial)

This code can be modified and used to videos as well, however it is not viable for real-time segmentation
