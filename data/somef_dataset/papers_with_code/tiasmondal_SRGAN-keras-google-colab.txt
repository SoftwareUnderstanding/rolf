# Single Image Super resolution using  Generative Adversarial Neural Network

This project focuses on increasing the resolution of a low resolution image to a high resolution image.

Paper source https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf

This involvs First converting the high res image to low resolution by downsampling and then using the trained model weights to convert to Super 
Resolution image.

# Dataset used

CIFAR10
