The aim was to alleviate the seq2seq problem of the fixed size of the context vector making impossible to memorize first parts of a long sequence. \nThe secret sauce invented by attention is to create shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. The weights of these shortcut connections are customizable for each output element. \n",
