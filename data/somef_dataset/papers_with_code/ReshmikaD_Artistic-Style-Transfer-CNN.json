      "excerpt": "This model is an implementation of a research paper by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge, (2015) : A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style. \nNeural Style Artistic Transfer is a deep learning technique that merges two images, namely, a \"content\" image (A) and a \"style\" image (B), to create a \"generated\" image (G). G is a combination of A with the style of image B. \nThis model is implemented using Transfer Learning. It uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that.  \nFollowing the original paper, this model is built using the VGG19 network (19-layer version of the VGG network)  \nThis model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and therefore has learned to recognize a variety of features at the earlier and deeper layers. This pretrained model was taken from the MatConvNet. \n",
