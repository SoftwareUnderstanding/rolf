I will begin by setting the goals of the project, then I will give a walkthrough of the process, the decisions I made and parameters chosen. I will then describe the results of the process, followed by a discussion about the limitations and possible improvements.\n\n![Original image](./images/orig_image.jpg)\n\n",
