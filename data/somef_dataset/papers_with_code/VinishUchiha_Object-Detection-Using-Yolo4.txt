# Object-Detection-Using-Yolo4

**You only look once (YOLO)** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.YOLOv4(Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection) paper was released last month with improved performance.

### YOLO Intro
First released in 2015, **YOLO** outperformed almost all other object detection architectures, both in terms of speed and accuracy. Since then, the architecture has been improved several times.
