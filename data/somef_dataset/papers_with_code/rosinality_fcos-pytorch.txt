Re-implementation of FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355)

I have implemented FCOS to study object detection. Most of the code came from:

* https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS
* https://github.com/yqyao/FCOS_PLUS
* https://github.com/vov-net/VoVNet-Classification

I think FCOS is very interesting approach to object detection!
