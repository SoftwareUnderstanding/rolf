      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10198\">Memory-Compressed Attention</a>, in Pytorch. This repository offers both the causal and non-causal variant, and will take care of the padding if the sequence length is not divisible by the compression ratio.\n\nThe code also resolves an edge-case where the very first query have no keys to attend to in the auto-regressive scenario. The solution is to use null key/values, appended to the final compressed set, so that there is always at least 1 key for all queries to attend to.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ pip install memory_compressed_attention\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom memory_compressed_attention import MemoryCompressedAttention\n\nattn = MemoryCompressedAttention(\n    dim = 512,\n    heads = 8,                 # number of heads\n    causal = False,            # auto-regressive or not\n    compression_factor = 3,    # compression ratio\n    dropout = 0.1              # dropout post-attention\n"
