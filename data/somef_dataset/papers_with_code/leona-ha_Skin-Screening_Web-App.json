      "excerpt": "Skin Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, with increasing incidence. In Germany, it makes up one third of all cancer diagnoses (https://www.tk.de/techniker/gesundheit-und-medizin/praevention-und-frueherkennung/hautkrebs-fruehererkennung/hautkrebs-wie-hoch-ist-das-risiko-2015296). While Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent type of skin cancer, Melanoma is considered the most dangerous one. In both cases, however, early diagnosis is crucial to facilitate successfull treatment. \nSince lesions occur on the surface of the skin, visual detection via dermatoscopy (an imaging technique that enables visualisation of deeper skin levels by removing surface reflection) is the best practice. With the widespread availability of high resolution cameras and even smartphone devices for skin monitoring (e.g. https://dermlite.com/products/dermlite-hud), research on automated analysis is growing. As an important step in the development of automated diagnostics, the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) is hosting challenges on skin lesion analysis since 2016, providing the world's largest repository of standardized, publicly available dermatoscopic images. \nThis project aims to provide a web-application that classifies uploaded images of skin lesions into one of the following diagnostic labels: \n",

      "excerpt": "For this project, I used the HAM10000 (\"Human against machine with 10000 images) dataset, a collection of 10015 dermatoscopic images that were made publibly available for the ISIC challenge, to train an artifical neural network to diagnose the pigmented skin lesions. \nSince the risk of skin cancer increases with age and is higher in men, I included age and gender to improve accuracy. \nPlease note: Although I achieved a categorical accuracy of around 81%, the final model is heavily biased towards Nevi, lacks the appropriate sensitivity and specificity and thus should not (yet) be used for diagnostic purposes. Click here to try out my model! \nThe distribution of image labels in the HAM10000 dataset are supposed to reflect the real-world setting. Thus, there's a strong categorical imbalance with around 6000 images showing benign melanocytic nevi and only 100-1000 images in the remaining categories. \n",

      "excerpt": "With the web-application in mind, I decided to apply transfer learning using MobileNet, a convolutional neural network that uses depthwise separable convolutions and is thus more leightweight than other pretrained models (~ 4.5 million parameters; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf). \nTo feed the auxiliary input (age and gender) into the model and concatenate it with the extracted image features I had to write a custom image data generator (see Combined_model.ipynb). \nFor Hyperparameter-Finetuning, I applied Cyclical Learning Rates and the One Cycle policy (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf), a relatively new approach that improved my model's performance and that I'll definitely check out further. Instead of choosing a fixed or decreasing learning rate, you define a minimum and maximum LR. By allowing the learning rate to cyclically oscillate between the two values you avoid local minima and saddle points. \nThe (for now) final model was converted into TensorFlow.js format and integrated into a simple web-framework using Flask and Bootstrap. I created two additional pages containing visualisations of the data and the model's performance made with Plotly. \n",
