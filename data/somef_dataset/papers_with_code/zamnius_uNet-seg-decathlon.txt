A custom designed U-Net achitecture shows generalisability when applied to 2 different semantic segmentation tasks. It can segment the both datasets, separateley, without human interaction.

The architecture is defined accourding to U-net architecture paradigm (Ronneberger et al., 2015)

The two datasets were taken from Medical Segmetation Decathlon Challenge
