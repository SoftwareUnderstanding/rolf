    "excerpt": "Contributing Guidelines\nHypernets has been developed and used by many active community members. Everyone is more than welcomed  to make the project better and more accessible to more users. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.\nWe are proud of this project and have been working to make it great since day one. We believe you will love it and we need your help and everything about Hypernets you have in your mind pushes this project forward.\nJoin Us!\nBug Reports and Feature Requests\nThe single most important contribution that you can make is to report bugs and make feature requests. The development work on Hypernets is largely driven by these, so please make your voice heard!\nHere are some issue templates we recommend  while you report bugs or suggest features.\n - Bug Issue\n - Feature Request\n - Other Issues\nIdeally, you can attach some code in your issue to reproduce the bug.\nContributing via Pull Requests\nCode contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:\n\nYou are working against the latest source on the master branch.\nYou check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make\n   sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.\nYou open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for\n   your time to be wasted.\n\nTo send us a pull request, please:\n\nFork the repository.\nModify the source \nEnsure local tests pass.\nCommit to your fork using clear commit messages.\nSend us a pull request,",

Please send your CV to yangjian@zetyun.com. (Application deadline: TBD.) \nHypernets is a general AutoML framework, based on which it can implement automatic optimization tools for various machine learning frameworks and libraries, including deep learning frameworks such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch, and machine learning libraries like sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, etc. \nWe introduced an abstract search space representation, taking into account the requirements of hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search(NAS), making Hypernets a general framework that can adapt to various automated machine learning needs. \n",
