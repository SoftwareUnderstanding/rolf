This algorithm quantifies predictive predictive uncertainty in non-Bayesian NN with `Deep Ensemble Model`.  \n\n\n\n**Contribution** of this paper is that it describes `simple` and `scalable` method for `estimating predictive uncertainty estimates` from NN.\n\n\n\nThis paper uses 3 things for training\n\n- Proper Scoring Rules\n- Adversarial Training to smooth predictive distributions\n- Deep Ensembles\n\nThis repository implemented without Adversarial training\n\n\n\nImplementation and Results are as follows.\n\n\n\n",
