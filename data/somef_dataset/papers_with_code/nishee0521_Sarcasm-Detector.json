      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146 by Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder, consisting of AWD_LSTM was used for the classification of Sarcastic and Non-sarcastic sentences. \n\nThe pretrained weights for this model was obtained, which was previously trained on WikiText-103 data\n\n\nTRAINING THE LANGUAGE MODEL\n\n The encoder was trained with both training as well as test data to increase the vocabulary of the language model.\n \n FastAI\u2019s tokenization method was used to convert the raw data before feeding it to the language model. \n \nMethods like Stemming, Lemmatization and Removing English stopwords are not used because using these leads to a huge loss of contextual information.
