      "excerpt": "1. You have to correctly setup detectron2, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2. Here is the installation instructuion: https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html. You need to have Linux or macOS with Python >= 3.6, Pytorch >= 1.6.\n\n2. Go to detectron2/projects/UNet/configs, choose the a config file you wish to use, currently the configs allow you to modify:\n\n   - Channels of hidden layers: official implementation is 64-128-256-512-1024, you can change it to 16-32-32-64 or whatever you want, change the UNET_CHANNELS entry in configs.\n   - INPUT.MIN_SIZE_TRAIN is used as resizing your image, if you want your input image to be resized to (512, 512), just put (512, 512) in that entry.\n   - CROP.SIZE is used in random cropping.\n   - NUM_CLASSES, if you choose NUM_CLASSES=3, you have to prepare your sem_seg_masks with pixel values 0, 1, 2 representing three classes. \n   - In the config of UNet++, there is an entry called UNETPP_USE_SUBNET_IN_INFERENCE, that means the entire net is used for training, but only some subnets are used in inference, for more details, see UNet++ paper, leave it as 0 if you do not want this feature.\n\n3. Prepare your own dataset, put your dataset under data, you have to **Write Your Own DataLoading Function**. All you have to do is modify load_train_data() and load_val_data() function in data/register_dataset.py, that function does arbitrary things and returns a list[dict], where each dict represents an image and should contain following keys:\n\n   - file_name (str): the full path to your image\n\n   - height (int): the height of input image\n\n   - width (int): the width of input image\n\n   - image_id (str or int): a unique id appointed to a specific image\n\n   - sem_seg_file_name (str): the full path to your semantic segmentation masks, where for each mask,\n\n   \u200b                        you need to use a pixel value for a class, starting from 0, 1, ...\n\n   Briefly, your function will be like:\n\n   ```python\n   def load_train_data():\n       dataset = []\n   \tfor image in your_dataset:\n       \timg_dict = {\n               \"file_name\": path/to/image,\n               \"height\": height,\n               \"width\": width,\n               \"image_id\": a_unique_image_id,\n               \"sem_seg_file\": path/to/sem_seg_file,\n           }\n           dataset.append(img_dict)\n       return dataset\n   ```\n\n4. After all these preparations, run (Assume you want to run UNet) :\n\n   ```console\n   cd projects/UNet\n   python train_net.py --config-file configs/Base-UNet-DS16-Semantic.yaml\n   ```\n\n5. Model after training will be saved to /output/, modify SOLVER details and training details in config, example usage:\n\n   ```console\n   python train_net.py --config-file configs/Base-UNet-DS16-Semantic.yaml \\ \n   MODEL.WEIGHTS path/to/your/model \\\n   SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.001 \\\n   SOLVER.MAX_ITER 50000 \n   ```\n\n   Check detectron2/detectron2/config/defaults.py for all config entries that you can modify\n\n",
