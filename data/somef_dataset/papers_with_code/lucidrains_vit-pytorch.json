First it proposes to do per-channel multiplication of the output of the residual block. Second, it proposes to have the patches attend to one another, and only allow the CLS token to attend to the patches in the last few layers.\n\nThey also add <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#talking-heads-attention\">Talking Heads</a>, noting improvements\n\nYou can use this scheme as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.cait import CaiT\n\nv = CaiT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 12,             # depth of transformer for patch to patch attention only\n    cls_depth = 2,          # depth of cross attention of CLS tokens to patch\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1,\n    layer_dropout = 0.05    # randomly dropout 5% of the layers\n",
