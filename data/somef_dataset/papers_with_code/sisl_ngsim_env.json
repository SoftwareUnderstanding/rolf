This design decision enables ngsim_env to be used as an environment in which any imitation learning algorithm can be tested. Similarly, this design decision enables the GAIL algorithm to be a separate module that can be tested in any environment be that ngsim_env or otherwise. The installation process below gets the GAIL implementation from [sisl/hgail](https://github.com/sisl/hgail)\n- It also does not contain the human driver data you need for the environment to work. The installation process below gets the data from [sisl/NGSIM.jl](https://github.com/sisl/NGSIM.jl).\n- Figure below shows a diagram of the repositories ngsim_env depends on:\n![dependecies](docs/ngsim_env:RepositoryDependencies.png)\n\n",

Train a policy, this involves running imitate.py \n```bash\npython imitate.py --exp_name NGSIM-gail --n_itr 1000 --policy_recurrent True\n```\n2. Run the trained policy by using it to drive a car (this creates trajectories on all NGSIM sections using the trained policy). The training step was called imitate. This step is called validate.\n```bash\npython validate.py --n_proc 5 --exp_dir ../../data/experiments/NGSIM-gail/ --params_filename itr_1000.npz --random_seed 42\n```\n3. Visualize the results: Open up a jupyter notebook and use the visualize*.ipynb files.\n  - the visualize family of ipynb's have headers at the top of each file describing what it does.\n    - visualize.ipynb is for extracting the Root Mean Square Error\n    - visualize_trajectories.ipynb creates videos such as the one shown below in the demo section\n    - visualize_emergent.ipynb calculates the emergent metrics such as offroad duration and collision rate\n\n",
