      "excerpt": "Using Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis on a dataset with 515K reviews on luxury European hotels, I have obtained a training accuracy of 93.5 percent, and a testing accuracy of 92.5 percent when predicting positive and negative reviews. The most informative words indicating a review to be positive or negative are also found, and positive reviews reflect more on hotel staff and location, while highly negative reviews tend to focus on facilities. \nThis project is based on my Final Project for Python for Data Science on edx, first submitted in Dec. 2017, using sentiment analysis to analyze 515K European Hotel Reviews. \nFolks at Radical.io (https://www.radical.io/) were very kind in welcoming me into their office to give a presentation about this project. I have uploaded the slides for my 15-min talk which included an overview of the Data Science process, different types of Machine Learning, and extra slides on basics of the ULMFiT approach for NLP. \nThe presentation was well-received, and they kindly posted about it here:  \n",
