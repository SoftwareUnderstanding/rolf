      "excerpt": "Most users do not need to know C++ or Python, they can simply use the OpenPose Demo in their command-line tool (e.g., PowerShell/Terminal). E.g., this would run OpenPose on the webcam and display the body keypoints:\n```\n#: Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\\media\\video.avi\n```\n\nYou can also add any of the available flags in any order. Do you also want to add face and/or hands? Add the `--face` and/or `--hand` flags. Do you also want to save the output keypoints on JSON files on disk? Add the `--write_json` flag, etc.\n```\n#: Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\\media\\video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n\nAfter [installing](#installation) OpenPose, check [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for a quick overview of all the alternatives and tutorials.\n\n\n\n",
