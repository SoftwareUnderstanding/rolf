# GAN-Implementations

1) GAN implementation on MNIST Dataset from Goodfellow's paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661, using the no-saturation loss for the generator. Some tips, 
 like Dropout (in the discriminator instead of the generator, which worked better in practice) and label smoothing come from : https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks
