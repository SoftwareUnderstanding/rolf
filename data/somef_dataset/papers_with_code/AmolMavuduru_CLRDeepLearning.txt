# CLRDeepLearning

This repository contains experiments with applying the concept of Cyclical Learning Rates (CLR)
outlined in the paper, "A Disciplined Approach to Neural Network Hyperparameters", which
can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf

Currently, this procedure is used in this repo in experiments with training CNNs on the 
Fashion MNIST dataset.
