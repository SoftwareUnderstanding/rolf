# convolutional_GAN_basics

In this repository I have the jupyter notebook and other files that I used for the lesson about deep convolutional 
generative adversarial network (DCGAN).

In this exercise we had to define both the generator and discriminator networks of a GAN that would read, ultimately, 
be able to generate images of numbers as close as possible to real pictures.

I utilized an Adam optimizer for both the generator and discriminator networks, as described in the paper of the creator 
of DCGANs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf
