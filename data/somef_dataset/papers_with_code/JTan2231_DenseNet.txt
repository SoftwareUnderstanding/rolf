# DenseNet
DenseNet implementation using the keras API from Tensorflow 2.2. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf for architecture details.

Run main.py to train the network.

Only tested using Tensorflow 2.2. TensorFlow 2.2 and tensorflow-datasets are the only requirements.

# TODO
Train the network and add weights. In theory (since the parameter counts match), the net should replicate the paper's results.
