# Binanace_trading_simulation
This project is to about finding the optimal __Fee__ mechanism in the Exchange. RL agents acts as people under certain Fee policies. We observe how RL agents's behavior changes with Fee mechanism changes. Fee mechanism would change total trade volume and total fee. This project is maintained as Binance Fellowship.

Our project environment is based on https://github.com/Yvictor/TradingGym/

# Structure
1. [agent](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/agent)
    Stores trading agents and specify how to train the agents and how to use them. 
2. [data](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/data)
    Stores the historical data to train the agents
3. [env](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/env)
    Stores the environment where fee different fee mechanisms applied

# Simulation Method
 1. **Train RL agents** using [trading gym](https://github.com/Yvictor/TradingGym/). 

 2. **Transfer agents** to different environments where different fee mechanism is applied. 
 Agents will trained again for 500 episodes more to adapt to each environment. Also, differentiate agents by varying risk_aversion ratio so that some agents prefer risk while others not.

 3. **Observe** how agents behave in each environment. Especially watch the total_volume and total_fee from each environment. Derive insights from the observation what characteristics of fee mechanism makes the difference.


# Future Plan
Provide environment where Limit order available -> lagged matching available to reflect more realistic trading environment

# Adopted Fee mechanisms (Could be added more)
1. No fee
2. fee = 0.003 (0.3%)
3. fee = 0.005 (0.5%)
4. Bollinger band bound Environment
5. RSI bound Environment
6. MACD bound Environment
7. Stochastic slow bound Environment

# Results
## Total fee and total volume under different fee rate

## How Data feature affects TradingAgent's Decision
Using [integrated_gradient](https://medium.com/@kartikeyabhardwaj98/integrated-gradients-for-deep-neural-networks-c114e3968eae), we can interpret how agents observe the data.
X axis represents actions and Y axis represents the feature of data. The graph shows how the feature of data affects the action decision of trading agent. You can see that the weight distribution of feature is different depending on the training algorithms.

## Same Agent and Same OHLCV state, but different decision
![DifferentDecision](figs/Agent1DifferentDecision.png)
The above figure shows the trading volume of Agent1 differing the fee environment. It shows same agent under same OHLCV situation makes different decisions.
