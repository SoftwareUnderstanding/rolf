These two LSTM layes are bidirectional, which include a forwads LSTM and a backwards LSTM.  \nFeature extraction was done by reading all training reviews and tokenizing all english words, as well as removing stop words using nltk package. \n",

      "excerpt": "Then, you go backwards computing derivatives. This uses the cell states (what the network knows at a given point in time) to figure out how to change the network's weights. When LSTM updates cell states, we choose to use the default Adam optimizer (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8), which is a method for Stochastic Optimization. The optimizer minimizes the loss function, which here is the mean square error between expected output and acutal output. \ninput matrix shape is (number of samples x maxlen) \nnumber_of_samples here is 25000 reviews. All reviews are transform into sequences of word vector. \n",
