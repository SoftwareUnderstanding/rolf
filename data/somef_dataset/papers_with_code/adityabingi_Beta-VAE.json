Check data_crop in config.py \nDisentanglement obtained by carefully tuning beta-norm(\u03b2norm). As this work is completely unsupervised visual inspection of latent space traversal showed best disentangled representations at \u03b2norm = 0.7(kl_weight in config.py). \nFollowing are the latent space traversal images obtained by fixing a particular dimension of latent vector and interpolating that dimension in the range [-3.0, 3.0]  for 5 randomly chosen seed latent vectors. It can be observed that Beta-VAE discovered latent generating factors such as Smile, Facial brightness, Baldness and others. \n",
