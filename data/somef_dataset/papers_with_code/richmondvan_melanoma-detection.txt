# Melanoma Detection

Evan Zheng, April 2020

A convolutional neural network built for mobile devices to detect whether a skin lesion is malignant or benign.

Preprocessed data can be found at https://github.com/richmondvan/isic-image-database

The CNN takes advantage of a pretrained feature-detection layer from MobileNet V2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381

Data preprocessing done on Python 3.8 with Visual Studio Code, with the Python Pillow image library.

Training performed with Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colaboratory.
