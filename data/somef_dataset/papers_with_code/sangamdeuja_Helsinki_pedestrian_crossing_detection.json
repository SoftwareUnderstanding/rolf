      "excerpt": "The continuous monitoring of street signals is important to regulate the traffic smoothly and to avoid accidents. There are challanges in maintaining such signals throughout since those involve plannning,time and labour. One of the major challanges is to maintain the pedestrian crossings. Pedestrian crossings may eventaully degrade because of increased traffic , weathering, lack of maintainace etc. It is really difficult to maintain pedestrian crossings from human source information because this causes delay in maintenance and there are high chances that several degraded signals are left out. \n\nCity of Helsinki,Finland is also facing similar situations, which needs immediate attention. For this problem, we are using traditional machine learning approach and deep learning techniques(frcnn,mask rcnn and retinanet) to detect the pedestrian crossing and monitor it's condition from orthophotos(aerial images).\n\n\n",
