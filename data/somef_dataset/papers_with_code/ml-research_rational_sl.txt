# Rational Supervised Learning
Rational Networks in Supervized Learning such as MNIST, CIFAR and Imagenet Classification Tasks.

Rational functions outperformes every non-learnable one (*cf. [Pad√© Activation Units: ...](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06732.pdf)*).

Rational are also here used for lesioning. They replace Residual Blocks in a ResNet101:

|  Eval      | Lesion   |  L2.B3  |  L3.B13 |  L3.B19 |  L4.B2 |
|  ----      | ------   |  -----  |  ------ |  ------ |  ----- |
