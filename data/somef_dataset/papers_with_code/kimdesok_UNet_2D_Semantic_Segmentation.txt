# Semantic Segmentation of Cellular Nuclei - UNet Tensorflow 2
>* Dataset used in Kaggle's [Data Science Bowl 2018 "Nuclei Segmentation"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018)
>* The model architecture is the U-Net proposed by Olaf Ronneberger et al. [1] for biomedical image segmentation.
>* The original code is from Bengaluru, Karnatak [2] (based on an U-net starter - LB 0.277 by Kjetil Åmdal-Sævik)
>* Contour drawing is added to better visualize the nuclear boundary [3]
