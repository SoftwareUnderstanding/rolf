# Tacotron2-PyTorch
Yet another PyTorch implementation of [Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf). The project is highly based on [these](#References). I made some modification to improve speed and performance of both training and inference.

## TODO
- [ ] Combine with [WG-WaveNet](https://github.com/BogiHsu/WG-WaveNet).
- [ ] Add Colab demo.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.5.2
- torch >= 1.0.0
- numpy
- scipy
- pillow
- inflect
- librosa
- Unidecode
- matplotlib
- tensorboardX

## Preprocessing
Currently only support [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/). You can modify `hparams.py` for different sampling rates. `prep` decides whether to preprocess all utterances before training or online preprocess. `pth` sepecifies the path to store preprocessed data.

## Training
1. For training Tacotron2, run the following command.

```bash
python3 train.py --data_dir=<dir/to/dataset> --ckpt_dir=<dir/to/models>
```

2. For training using a pretrained model, run the following command.

```bash
python3 train.py --data_dir=<dir/to/dataset> --ckpt_dir=<dir/to/models> --ckpt_pth=<pth/to/pretrained/model>
```

3. For using Tensorboard (optional), run the following command.

```bash
python3 train.py --data_dir=<dir/to/dataset> --ckpt_dir=<dir/to/models> --log_dir=<dir/to/logs>
```

You can find alinment images and synthesized audio clips during training. Recording freqency and text to synthesize can be set in `hparams.py`.

## Inference
- For synthesizing wav files, run the following command.

```bash
python3 inference.py --ckpt_pth=<pth/to/model> --img_pth=<pth/to/save/alignment> --wav_pth=<pth/to/save/wavs> --text=<text/to/synthesize>
```

## Pretrained Model
You can download pretrained models from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vk2erozpkoltao6/AABCk4WryQtrt4BYthIKzbK7a?dl=0) (git commit: [9e7c26d](https://github.com/BogiHsu/Tacotron2-PyTorch/commit/9e7c26d93ea9d93332b1c316ac85c58771197d4f)). The hyperparameter for training is also in the directory.

## Vocoder
A vocoder is not implemented yet. For now it just reconstucts the linear spectrogram from the Mel spectrogram directly and uses Griffim-Lim to synthesize the waveform. A pipeline for [WG-WaveNet](https://github.com/BogiHsu/WG-WaveNet) is in progress. Or you can refer to [WaveNet](https://github.com/r9y9/wavenet_vocoder), [FFTNet](https://github.com/syang1993/FFTNet), or [WaveGlow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow).

## Results
You can find some samples in [results](https://github.com/BogiHsu/Tacotron2-PyTorch/tree/master/results). These results are generated using either pseudo inverse or WaveNet.

The alignment of the attention is pretty well now (about 100k training steps), the following figure is one sample.

This figure shows the Mel spectrogram from the decoder without the postnet, the Mel spectrgram with the postnet, and the alignment of the attention.
