We greatly appreciate the open source efforts of the library! \n",

We implement n-step transition collection by an environment wrapper in wrapper.py. The buffer is implemented in the main files. \nWe compute Q-function targets with two critics to reduce over-estimation. Targets are computed with Peng's Q(lambda), n-step, Retrace or tree-backup, in a recursive manner. \n",
