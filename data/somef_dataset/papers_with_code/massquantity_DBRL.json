      "excerpt": "DBRL is a toolkit used for training reinforcement learning recommendation models. The name DBRL stands for : Dataset Batch Reinforcement Learning, which differs from traditional reinforcement learning in that it only uses static dataset to train a model, without any further interaction with the environment. See Offline Reinforcement Learning: Tutorial, Review, \nand Perspectives on Open Problems for a comprehensive introduction. \nAfter the training, the model can be used for online serving. And indeed It has an online part, which mainly leverages Flink and the trained model for online recommendation. See FlinkRL for more details. The full system architecture is as follows : \nDBRL currently contains three algorithms: \n",

The original dataset consists  of three tables: `user.csv`, `item.csv`, `user_behavior.csv` . We'll first need to filter some users with too few interactions and merge all features together, and this is accomplished by `run_prepare_data.py`. Then we'll pretrain embeddings for every user and item by running `run_pretrain_embeddings.py` :\n\n```shell\n$ cd DBRL/dbrl\n$ python run_prepare_data.py\n$ python run_pretrain_embeddings.py --lr 0.001 --n_epochs 4\n```\n\nYou can tune the `lr` and `n_epochs` hyper-parameters to get better evaluate loss. Then we begin to train the model. Currently there are three algorithms in `DBRL`, so we can choose one of them:\n\n```shell\n$ python run_reinforce.py --n_epochs 5 --lr 1e-5\n$ python run_ddpg.py --n_epochs 5 --lr 1e-5\n$ python run_bcq.py --n_epochs 5 --lr 1e-5\n```\n\nAt this point, the `DBRL/resources` should contains at least 6 files:\n\n+ `model_xxx.pt`, the trained pytorch model.\n+ `tianchi.csv`, the transformed dataset.\n+ `tianchi_user_embeddings.npy`, the pretrained user embeddings in numpy `npy` format.\n+ `tianchi_item_embeddings.npy`, the pretrained item embeddings in numpy `npy` format.\n+ `user_map.json`, a json file that maps original user ids to ids used in the model.\n+ `item_map.json`, a json file that maps original item ids to ids used in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
