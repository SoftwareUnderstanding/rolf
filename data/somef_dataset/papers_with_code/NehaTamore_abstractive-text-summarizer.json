      "excerpt": "One approach to summarization is to extract parts of the document that are deemed interesting by some metric (for example, inverse-document frequency) and join them to form a summary. Algorithms of this flavor are called extractive summarization. \nOriginal Text: Alice and Bob took the train to visit the zoo. They saw a baby giraffe, a lion, and a flock of colorful tropical birds.  \nExtractive Summary: Alice and Bob visit the zoo. saw a flock of birds. \nAbove we extract the words bolded in the original text and concatenate them to form a summary. As we can see, sometimes the extractive constraint can make the summary awkward or grammatically strange.  \nAnother approach is to simply summarize as humans do, which is to not impose the extractive constraint and allow for rephrasings. This is called abstractive summarization. \nAbstractive summary: Alice and Bob visited the zoo and saw animals and birds. \nIn this example, we used words not in the original text, maintaining more of the information in a similar amount of words. It\u2019s clear we would prefer good abstractive summarizations, but how could an algorithm begin to do this? \n",
