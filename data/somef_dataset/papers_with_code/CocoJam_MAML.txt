Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks
This structure of the neural network had taken the meta-learning by storm, where without utilizing specific alternation of the structure dynamically and regulation to prevent catastrophically forget for meta-learning of addition task.

It is really interesting to see the gradient of the network itself through the different task, could include specific updates of the network to allow quick convergence of the network towards a new but related task.
