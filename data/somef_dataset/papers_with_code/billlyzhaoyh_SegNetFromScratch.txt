# SegNetFromScratch
Capstone project of fast.ai course v3 https://course.fast.ai/

## Step 1 
Recreate fastai Unet implementation on CamVid dataset

Status: Done
Todo: comeback to finish off the big model with better GPUs and run test set to obtain standard metrics to compare with SegNet models later.

## Step 2
Recreate the SegNet from scratch in Pytorch

## Step 3
Recreate the Bayesian SegNet from scratch in Pytorch
