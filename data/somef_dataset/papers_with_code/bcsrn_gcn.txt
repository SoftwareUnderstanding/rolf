For course CSCE 636 - Neural Networks Project:

Cora Dataset is used, and semi-supervised classification of nodes is performed. The dataset consists of Machine Learning papers. 
These papers are classified into one of the following seven classes:
		Case_Based
		Genetic_Algorithms
		Neural_Networks
		Probabilistic_Methods
		Reinforcement_Learning
		Rule_Learning
		Theory
    
Under pygcn-master/data/cora -> README more details on the data is available.
Under pygcn-master/pygcn -> layers.py, models.py, train.py can be found

Changes to dropout and hidden layers has been made

According to the paper - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf - the baseline accuracy on the cora dataset is 81.5%
