These segmentations are useful for measuring and visualizing anatomical structures, but also to analyze brain changes in case of diseases like Alzheimer. Today different automatic segmentations are available thanks to FAST (FSL), Freesurfer and ANTS. But these approaches are often inaccurate and require additional manual segmentations which are both time consuming and challenging. \n\n",

The idea was instead of training the network on complete slices, to train the network on pieces of the image so that we can use it for non-human data. \nThe UNet implemented took 2D patches of size : 64x64 as input.
