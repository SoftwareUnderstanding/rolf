### Implementation of word2vec embedding model from scratch using C++

#### Description
Word2Vec is a popular word embedding model which is used in major NLP models. Instead of representing every word in the document as one-hot vector, we learn the representation of word in form of an embedding based on the context and semantics around it

#### Build
g++ -std=c++11 word2vec.cc -o word2vec


### Remarks
