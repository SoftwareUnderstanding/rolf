It is basically a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is\ncomputed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention\ncomputation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.\n\nSwin Transformer achieves strong performance on COCO object detection (`58.7 box AP` and `51.1 mask AP` on test-dev) and\nADE20K semantic segmentation (`53.5 mIoU` on val), surpassing previous models by a large margin.\n\n![teaser](figures/teaser.png)\n\n",
