The brain connectivity graphs are transformed by graph convolutional networks into representations, while the external memory mechanism is in charge of iteratively (multiple hops) reading clinical sequences and choosing what to retrieve from memories so that the representations learned by graph convolution can be augmented. \n",

By pushing the clinical sequences into the memories, the continuous representations of this external information are processed with brain graphs together so that a more comprehensive diagnosis could be made. The above figure is an illustration of memory augmented graph convolution in a single hop (the 1-st hop). This repository contains the slides we presented in ICDM 2018. \nMemGCN provides a learning strategy for multi-modality data with sequential and graph structure in general scenarios. The code is documented and should be easy to modify for your own applications. \nThere is implementations used in:  \nSainbayar Sukhbaatar, Arthur Szlam, Jason Weston, Rob Fergus, End-To-End Memory Networks, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2015. \n",
