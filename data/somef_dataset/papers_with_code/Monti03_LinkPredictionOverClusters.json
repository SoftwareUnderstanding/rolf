      "excerpt": "In this repository, we have developed different techniques that try to exploit the clusters obtained from a graph to improve link prediction results. The proposed models are the following ones: \n- couple models: for each couple of clusters train a GAE model and predict the test edges between nodes inside a single cluster as avg of the predictions of the models trained over such cluster \n- single models with FC: for each cluster, we train a GAE model and for each couple of clusters we train an FC that is used to map the embeddings of each node over a common dimension with the nodes of the other cluster \n- shared model: a model where one of the two convolutional layers of the GAE model is shared among the different clusters \n- shared model with adversarial loss: to improve the precedent model we tried to use an adversary loss to let the embeddings in output from the shared layer be independent of the cluster from which they come \n- single models with adversarial loss: in this case, we train one GAE model for each cluster and use an adversary loss to let the embeddings in output be independent of the cluster from which they come \n",
