We extend the high-resolution representation (HRNet) [1] by augmenting the high-resolution representation by aggregating the (upsampled) representations from all the parallel\nconvolutions, leading to stronger representations. We build a multi-level representation from the high resolution and apply it to the Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN framework. This proposed approach achieves superior results to existing single-model networks \non COCO object detection.
