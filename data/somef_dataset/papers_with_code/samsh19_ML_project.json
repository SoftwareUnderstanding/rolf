Instead of the style transfer, I think that it is more closely to the image synthesis.

Note that the technique has an improved version from Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155.pdf) for better resolution and a more efficient way of predicting. \n",
