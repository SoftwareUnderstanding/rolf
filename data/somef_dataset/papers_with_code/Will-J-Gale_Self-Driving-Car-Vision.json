      "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597\n\nIt was trained using 4 separate datasets which:  \n* https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/  \n* https://phuang17.github.io/DeepMVS/mvs-synth.html \n* https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/ \n* http://synthia-dataset.net/  \n\nCurrently the model takes in an image and predicts object segmentation, lane prediction\nand depth estimation however, this model's outputs will eventually all feed into a final \nconvolutional section which will predict the steering and throttle commands to drive \nthe car.  \n\nThe final small model shown on the left of the image above is the speed prediction.\nThis is specific to the GTA5 project as there is no direct way of getting the current\nspeed of the car through the image.\n\n# Testing the model\nThe TestModel.py script provided gives a demonstration on how to use the model.  \nSimply provide a path to an image to the __imageFilepath__ variable and hit run,  \nthis will create a single image with the original image a all 3 predictions to  \nappear on screen.\n\n# More examples\nhttps://github.com/Will-J-Gale/Self-Driving-Car-Vision/blob/master/Images/CarVision2.gif  \nhttps://github.com/Will-J-Gale/Self-Driving-Car-Vision/blob/master/Images/CarVision3.gif  \nhttps://github.com/Will-J-Gale/Self-Driving-Car-Vision/blob/master/Images/CarVision4.gif  "
