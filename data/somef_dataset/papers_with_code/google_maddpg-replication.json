      "excerpt": "This is a partial replication of \"Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments\" (Lowe, Wu, Tamar, Harb, Abbeel, Mordatch 2017). That paper introduced an algorithm called MADDPG (multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient) for training multiple agents that can interact intelligently. The authors released source code for replicating the paper. This repository documents the process of running that code and the results. \nAlthough I (Nisan Stiennon) am affiliated with Google, this is not an official Google product. \nCheck out the Jupyter notebook for results. \n",
