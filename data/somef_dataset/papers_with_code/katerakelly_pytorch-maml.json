Also in this experiment, we can see evidence of overfitting to the meta-training set. \nThe 5-way results are achieved by simply meta-testing the network trained on the 1-shot task on the 5-shot task (e.g. for the 5-way 5-shot result, test the 5-way 1-shot trained network with 5-shots). Again the 20-way result is lower here than reported in the paper. \nThis repo also contains code for running maml experiments on permuted MNIST (tasks are created by shuffling the labels). \nThis is a nice sanity check task. \n",
