For more details, please refer to [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).
For training procedure for 300x300 model, please, follow `SSD_simpthons_training.ipynb` for examples. 

If you run `videotest_example.py` file, Simpsons movie file (001.mp4) will be played and character will be detected.  
Execute  
`$python videotest_example.py`  
code at terminal.
