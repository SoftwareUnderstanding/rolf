# Graph-based joint model with Nonignorable Missingness (GNM)
This is a Keras implementation of the GNM model in paper ’Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning with Nonignorable Nonresponses‘ by Fan Zhou et al (NeurIPS 2019).

## Acknowledgements
This GNM model supports the architecture of 

Graph Convolution Network (Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling ICLR 2017), [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907),

Graph Attention Networks (Veličković *et al.*, ICLR 2018): [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)

We build our pipeline based on [Keras Graph Attention Network](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/keras-gat) and [Keras Graph Convolution Network](https://github.com/tkipf/keras-gcn).

I copied the code in `utils.py` almost verbatim from [this repo by Thomas Kipf](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn) and add some new codes such as evaluation model prediction performance split training/validation/test data.

## Replicating experiments
To replicate the simple setup of the real analysis in the paper, just run:
```sh
$ python sim_cora_GCN.py
```
and 
```sh
$ python sim_cora_GAT.py
```
for the Cora dataset with ‘lambda = 2’ or

```sh
$ python sim_citeseer_GAT.py
```
and 
```sh
$ python sim_citeseer_GCN.py
```
for the Citeseer dataset.

To replicate the complicated setup of the real analysis in the paper, you may try
```sh
$ python real_cora.py
```
