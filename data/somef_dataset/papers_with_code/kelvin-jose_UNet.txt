## UNet - Architecture from scratch
The u-net is convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images. Up to now it has outperformed the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the [ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks](http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/). It has won the [Grand Challenge for Computer-Automated Detection of Caries in Bitewing Radiography at ISBI 2015](http://www-o.ntust.edu.tw/~cweiwang/ISBI2015/challenge2/index.html), and it has won the [Cell Tracking Challenge at ISBI 2015](http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge/Cell_Tracking_Challenge/Welcome.html) on the two most challenging transmitted light microscopy categories (Phase contrast and DIC microscopy) by a large margin
