      "excerpt": "Neural Style learning is one of the most exciting sides of deep learning.Ever wondered if Angelina Jolie was painted by Da Vinci?<br /> \nNeural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.  <br /> \nNeural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image  <br /> \n It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet. \n",
