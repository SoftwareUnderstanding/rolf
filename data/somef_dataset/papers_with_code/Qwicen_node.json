Install packages from `requirements.txt`\n * It is critical that you use __torch >= 1.1__, not 1.0 or earlier \n * You will also need jupyter or some other way to work with .ipynb files\n4. Run jupyter notebook and open a notebook in `./notebooks/`\n * Before you run the first cell, change `%env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=#` to an index that you plan to use.\n * The notebook downloads data from dropbox. You will need __1-5Gb__ of disk space depending on dataset.\n\nWe showcase two typical learning scenarios for classification and regression. Please consult the original paper for training details.\n",
