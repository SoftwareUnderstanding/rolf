The dataset is a homogeneous, unweighted, undirected graph representing the drug-drug interaction network.

However, considering the amount of available time for this experiment, I will skip this step, and I will test the link prediction mechanism directly on the test edges, using the model resulting from the last epoch of the training process. \nThe evaluation metric for this experiment is the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). In a nutshell, it is the count of how many correct links (positive examples) are ranked in the top-n positions against a bunch of synthetic negative examples. In this specific experiment, for each drug interaction, a set of approximately 100.000 randomly sampled negative examples are created. Then, I compute the count of the ratio of positive edges ranked at the K-place or above (Hits@K). \n",

I test 5 epochs because, considering the dimension of the training graph, it can not be directly used for the training process. For this reason, I apply a sampling process, which selects a fixed number of neighbors for all the nodes (https://docs.dgl.ai/en/0.6.x/generated/dgl.sampling.sample_neighbors.html). Then, I want to test that each epoch has the same duration. Considering a --n-sample = 500 hyperparameter, the number of sampled edges for each epoch is around 30.000 over 1067911. \n",

Indeed, the attention coefficients try to grasp the relevance of each neighbor for the central node.
