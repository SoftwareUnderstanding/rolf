      "excerpt": "DeepDream is an artistic image-modification technique that uses the representations learnd by CNN. It was firstt released by Google in the summer of 2015, as an implementation written using the Caffe framework.  \nIt quickly became an internet sensation thanks to the trippy pictures it could generate. DeepDream convnet was trained on ImageNet, where dog breeds and bird species are vastly overpresented. \nThe DeepDream algorithm is almost identical to the convnet filter-visualization technique, consisting of running a convnet in reverse: doing gradient ascent on the input to the convnet in order to maximize the activation of a spesific filter in an upper layer of the convnet. \n",
