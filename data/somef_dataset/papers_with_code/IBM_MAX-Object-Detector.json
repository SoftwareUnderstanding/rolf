      "excerpt": "This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy an object detection model. This model recognizes the objects \npresent in an image from the 80 different high-level classes of objects in the COCO Dataset. The \nmodel consists of a deep convolutional net base model for image feature extraction, together with additional \nconvolutional layers specialized for the task of object detection, that was trained on the COCO data set. The input to \nthe model is an image, and the output is a list of estimated class probabilities for the objects detected in the image. \nThe model is based on the SSD Mobilenet V1 and Faster RCNN ResNet101 object detection model for TensorFlow. The model files are hosted on IBM Cloud Object Storage: ssd_mobilenet_v1.tar.gz and faster_rcnn_resnet101.tar.gz. The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service in a Docker container. This repository was developed as part of the IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange and the public API is powered by IBM Cloud. \n",

The coordinates of the bounding box are returned in the `detection_box` field, and contain the array of normalized coordinates (ranging from 0 to 1) in the form `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]`.\n\n![Swagger Doc Screenshot](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)\n\nYou can also test it on the command line, for example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -F \"image=@samples/dog-human.jpg\" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:5000/model/predict\n```\n\nYou should see a JSON response like that below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"predictions\": [\n      {\n          \"label_id\": \"1\",\n          \"label\": \"person\",\n          \"probability\": 0.944034993648529,\n          \"detection_box\": [\n              0.1242099404335022,\n              0.12507188320159912,\n              0.8423267006874084,\n              0.5974075794219971\n          ]\n      },\n      {\n          \"label_id\": \"18\",\n          \"label\": \"dog\",\n          \"probability\": 0.8645511865615845,\n          \"detection_box\": [\n              0.10447660088539124,\n              0.17799153923988342,\n              0.8422801494598389,\n              0.732001781463623\n          ]\n      }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can also control the probability threshold for what objects are returned using the `threshold` argument like below:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -F \"image=@samples/dog-human.jpg\" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:5000/model/predict?threshold=0.5\n```\n\nThe optional `threshold` parameter is the minimum `probability` value for predicted labels returned by the model.\nThe default value for `threshold` is `0.7`.\n\n",
