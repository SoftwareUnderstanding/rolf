This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. We will using 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients. GPU will be used for fast training of deep learning architecture. Upon completion of development, we would be able to: \n1.  Recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging \n2.  Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance \n",
