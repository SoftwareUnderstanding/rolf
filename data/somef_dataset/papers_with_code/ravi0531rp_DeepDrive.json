The basic Obstacle detection and avoiding algorithm makes it possible. \nThis phase is quite identical to phase I except for the fact that all the same is implemented on Raspberry Pi.  \n The interfacing with Raspberry Pi gave quite a few advantages with the computation power. \nThis phase involved 5 ultrasonic Sensors interfaced with Raspberry Pi.  \n",
