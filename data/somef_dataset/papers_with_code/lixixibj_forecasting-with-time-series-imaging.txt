Forecasting with time series imaging
====================================


This page introduces how to use our code for image based time series forecasting. The code is divided 2 parts:

- feature extraction with sift or pretrained CNN
- model combination based on extracted feature

We completed feature extraction with Python because Python supports image processing well, while for model combination, we chose R because R supports statistical forecasting methods very well.

### Feature extraction

#### Feature extraction with sift

In the folder `feature_extraction/feature_extraction_with_sift`, the function `image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_sift()` in the file `compute_features_sift.py` is used to compute features of time series image. The parameters explaination for this function `image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_sift(file_path_of_ts,file_path_of_feature,num_cores)`:

- `file_path_of_ts`: the file path of your time series data and it is saved in the format of csv. You can dowoload M4 dataset from [here](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/M4DataSet.zip). Then, zip it and put it in `feature_extraction/ts-data/M4/MM4DataSet/`.

- `file_path_of_feature`: the file path where you want to save the extracted feature. In this project, we save the extracted features in `feature_extraction/feature_extraction_with_sift/sift-features`.

- `num_cores ` : number of cores that you want to use when parallel computing.

We show an exmple of extracting sift features of M4 mmonthly dataset:

```py
file_path_of_ts = '../ts-data/M4/M4DataSet/Monthly-train.csv'
file_path_of_feature = 'sift-features/M4/M4-monthly-feature-sift.csv'
num_cores = 4
image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_sift(file_path_of_ts, file_path_of_feature, num_cores)
```
The ouput is features of time series images and its shape is n-by-4200, where n is the number of time series.

#### Feature extraction with pretrained-CNN

In the folder `feature_extraction/feature_extraction_with_pretrained_CNN`, the function `image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_sift()` in the file `compute_features_cnn.py` is used to compute features of time series image. Parameters explaination for function `image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_cnn(file_path_of_ts,file_path_of_feature,cnn_model_name,file_path_of_pretrained_model)`:

- `file_path_of_ts`: the file path of your time series data and it is saved in the format of csv. You can dowoload M4 dataset from [here](https://www.m4.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/M4DataSet.zip). Then, zip it and put it in `feature_extraction/ts-data/M4/MM4DataSet/`.

- `file_path_of_feature`: the file path where you want to save the extracted feature. In this project, we save the extracted features in `feature_extraction/feature_extraction_with_pretrained_CNN/cnn-features`.

- `cnn_model_name`: which pretrained CNN models you want to use, options include `inception_v1 `,`resnet_v1 _101`,`resnet_v1_50` and `vgg_19`.

- `file_path_of_pretrained_model`: file path of pretrained models. You can download all the pretrained models in the following content.

We show an exmple of extracting inception-v1 features of M4 monthly dataset:

```py
file_path_of_ts = '../ts-data/M4/M4DataSet/Monthly-train.csv'
file_path_of_feature = 'cnn-features/M4/M4-monthly-feature-inceptionV1.csv'
cnn_model_name = 'inception_v1'
file_path_of_pretrained_model = 'pretrained-models/inception_v1.ckpt'
    
image_based_batch_ts_feature_extraction_with_cnn(
            file_path_of_ts,
            file_path_of_feature,
            cnn_model_name,
            file_path_of_pretrained_model)
```
The ouput is features of time series images and its shape is n-by-m, where n is the number of time series and m is the dimension of the features.

- Dimension of the output of the pretrained `Inception-v1` model: 1024.
- Dimension of the output of the pretrained `ResNet-v1-101` model: 2048.
- Dimension of the output of the pretrained `ResNet-v1-50` model: 2048.
- Dimension of the output of the pretrained `VGG` model: 1000.

#### Pretrained-CNN models

You can download all models [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13pyno-mdbazKs0o4N_Pk8ArDtk1RcE-U/view?usp=sharing).
Otherwise links for individual models can be found below.

These CNNs have been trained on the [ILSVRC-2012-CLS](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/)
image classification dataset.

In the table below, we list each model, the corresponding
TensorFlow model file, the link to the model checkpointã€‚

### Model combination

Based on the extracted features above, we can do model combination.

In the folder `model_combination/R`, the main function `image.based.model.combination()` in the file `model.comb.main.for.Tourism.R` is used to do model combination for Tourism dataset using M4 dataset as training data.
In the folder `model_combination/R`, the file `model.comb.main.for.M4.R` is used to do model combination for M4 dataset using M4 temporal holdout dataset as training data.

Here, we brifely introduce the function of other `.R` files.

- `forec_methods_list.R`: it is used to compute the forecasts of 9 candidate methods.
- `process_dataset.R`: it is used to compute the accuracy of forecasting methods.
- `combination_ensemble.R`: it is used to define the custom loss function of `xgboost`.
- `ensemble_classifier.R`: it is used to train and test the  `xgboost` model.
-  `hyperparam.R`: hyperparameters optimization for `xgboost`.
-  `hyperparam.search.main.R`:  an example show how to get opyimal hyperparameters for `xgboost`.
-  `tourism.benchmarks.R`: it is used to compute forecasts of the top methods in toursim competition.

```

We show an example of getting forecasts of Tourism monthly data with M4 monthly data as training data:

```r
data.type.of.training.data = 'Monthly'
data.type.of.testing.data = 'MONTHLY'
training.dataset = M4
testing.dataset = tourism
feature.type = 'resnet50'
params = c(14,1,1,0.7052)

file.path.of.training.data.features = 'feature_extraction/cnn/cnn-features/M4/Monthly-train-feature-resnet_v1_50.csv'
file.path.of.testing.data.features = 'feature_extraction/cnn/cnn-features/Tourism/tourism-monthly-train-feature-resnet_v1_50.csv'
file.path.of.training.data.prediction.value = './forecasts/M4/Monthly_ff.rda'
file.path.of.testing.data.prediction.value = './forecasts/Tourism/MONTHLY_ff.rda'

image.based.model.combination(data.type.of.training.data,
                              data.type.of.testing.data,
                              training.dataset,
                              testing.dataset,
                              feature.type,
                              file.path.of.training.data.features,
                              file.path.of.testing.data.features,
                              file.path.of.training.data.prediction.value,
                              file.path.of.testing.data.prediction.value,
                              params)

```
Then, we can get the forecasting accuracy of the combination method on the targeted dataset.
