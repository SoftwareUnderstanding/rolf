They will slow down approaching the same validation accuracy, instead, given the same number of training steps. However, --uda-steps matters after a bit testing. \nIt seems some of the training configurations given by MPL-pytorch do not match those of the original paper training, see this issue. \nAfter inspecting the validation accuracy curve, it seems the model can do better if given more training steps, as the performance is being improved slowly but steadily in the last 100k of 300k steps. \n",
