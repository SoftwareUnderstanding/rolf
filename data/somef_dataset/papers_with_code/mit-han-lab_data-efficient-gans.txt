This repository contains our implementation of Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment) in both PyTorch and TensorFlow. It can be used to significantly improve the data efficiency for GAN training. We have provided [DiffAugment-stylegan2](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-stylegan2) (TensorFlow) and [DiffAugment-stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-stylegan2-pytorch), [DiffAugment-biggan-cifar](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-biggan-cifar) (PyTorch) for GPU training, and [DiffAugment-biggan-imagenet](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-biggan-imagenet) (TensorFlow) for TPU training.

*Low-shot generation without pre-training. With DiffAugment, our model can generate high-fidelity images using only 100 Obama portraits, grumpy cats, or pandas from our collected 100-shot datasets, 160 cats or 389 dogs from the AnimalFace dataset at 256×256 resolution.*

*Unconditional generation results on CIFAR-10. StyleGAN2’s performance drastically degrades given less training data. With DiffAugment, we are able to roughly match its FID and outperform its Inception Score (IS) using only **20%** training data.*

## Overview
<img src="imgs/method.jpg" width="1000px"/>

*Overview of DiffAugment for updating D (left) and G (right). DiffAugment applies the augmentation T to both the real sample x and the generated output G(z). When we update G, gradients need to be back-propagated through T (iii), which requires T to be differentiable w.r.t. the input.*

## Training and Generation with 100 Images [![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/zsyzzsoft/5fbb71b9bf9a3217576bebae5de46fc2/data-efficient-gans.ipynb)

To generate an interpolation video using our pre-trained models:
```bash
cd DiffAugment-stylegan2
python generate_gif.py -r mit-han-lab:DiffAugment-stylegan2-100-shot-obama.pkl -o obama.gif
```
or to train a new model:
```bash
python run_low_shot.py --dataset=100-shot-obama --num-gpus=4
```
You may also try out `100-shot-grumpy_cat`, `100-shot-panda`, `100-shot-bridge_of_sighs`, `100-shot-medici_fountain`, `100-shot-temple_of_heaven`, `100-shot-wuzhen`, or the folder containing your own training images. Please refer to the [DiffAugment-stylegan2](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-stylegan2#100-shot-generation) README for the dependencies and details.

**[NEW!]** PyTorch training is now available:
```bash
cd DiffAugment-stylegan2-pytorch
python train.py --outdir=training-runs --data=https://data-efficient-gans.mit.edu/datasets/100-shot-obama.zip --gpus=1
```

## DiffAugment for StyleGAN2

To run *StyleGAN2 + DiffAugment* for unconditional generation on the 100-shot datasets, CIFAR, FFHQ, or LSUN, please refer to the [DiffAugment-stylegan2](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-stylegan2) README or [DiffAugment-stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-stylegan2-pytorch) for the PyTorch version.

## DiffAugment for BigGAN

Please refer to the [DiffAugment-biggan-cifar](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-biggan-cifar) README to run *BigGAN + DiffAugment* for conditional generation on CIFAR (using GPUs), and the [DiffAugment-biggan-imagenet](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/tree/master/DiffAugment-biggan-imagenet) README to run on ImageNet (using TPUs).

## Using DiffAugment for Your Own Training

To help you use DiffAugment in your own codebase, we provide portable DiffAugment operations of both TensorFlow and PyTorch versions in [DiffAugment_tf.py](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/blob/master/DiffAugment_tf.py) and [DiffAugment_pytorch.py](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans/blob/master/DiffAugment_pytorch.py). Generally, DiffAugment can be easily adopted in any model by substituting every *D(x)* with *D(T(x))*, where *x* can be real images or fake images, *D* is the discriminator, and *T* is the DiffAugment operation. For example,

```python
from DiffAugment_pytorch import DiffAugment
# from DiffAugment_tf import DiffAugment
policy = 'color,translation,cutout' # If your dataset is as small as ours (e.g.,
# hundreds of images), we recommend using the strongest Color + Translation + Cutout.
# For large datasets, try using a subset of transformations in ['color', 'translation', 'cutout'].
# Welcome to discover more DiffAugment transformations!

...
# Training loop: update D
reals = sample_real_images() # a batch of real images
z = sample_latent_vectors()
fakes = Generator(z) # a batch of fake images
real_scores = Discriminator(DiffAugment(reals, policy=policy))
fake_scores = Discriminator(DiffAugment(fakes, policy=policy))
# Calculating D's loss based on real_scores and fake_scores...
...

...
# Training loop: update G
z = sample_latent_vectors()
fakes = Generator(z) # a batch of fake images
fake_scores = Discriminator(DiffAugment(fakes, policy=policy))
# Calculating G's loss based on fake_scores...
...
```

We have implemented Color, Translation, and Cutout DiffAugment as visualized below:
