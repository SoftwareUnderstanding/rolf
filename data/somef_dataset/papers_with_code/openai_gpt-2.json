      "excerpt": "We have also released a dataset for researchers to study their behaviors. \n<sup></sup> Note that our original parameter counts were wrong due to an error (in our previous blog posts and paper).  Thus you may have seen small referred to as 117M and medium referred to as 345M.* \nGPT-2 models' robustness and worst case behaviors are not well-understood.  As with any machine-learned model, carefully evaluate GPT-2 for your use case, especially if used without fine-tuning or in safety-critical applications where reliability is important. \nThe dataset our GPT-2 models were trained on contains many texts with biases and factual inaccuracies, and thus GPT-2 models are likely to be biased and inaccurate as well. \nTo avoid having samples mistaken as human-written, we recommend clearly labeling samples as synthetic before wide dissemination.  Our models are often incoherent or inaccurate in subtle ways, which takes more than a quick read for a human to notice. \n",
