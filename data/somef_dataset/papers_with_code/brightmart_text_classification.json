Now we will show how CNN can be used for NLP, in in particular, text classification. Sentence length will be different from one to another. So we will use pad to get fixed length, n. For each token in the sentence, we will use word embedding to get a fixed dimension vector, d. So our input is a 2-dimension matrix:(n,d). This is similar with image for CNN. \n\nFirstly, we will do convolutional operation to our input. It is a element-wise multiply between filter and part of input. We use k number of filters, each filter size is a 2-dimension matrix (f,d). Now the output will be k number of lists. Each list has a length of n-f+1. each element is a scalar. Notice that the second dimension will be always the dimension of word embedding. We are using different size of filters to get rich features from text inputs. And this is something similar with n-gram features. \n\nSecondly, we will do max pooling for the output of convolutional operation. For k number of lists, we will get k number of scalars. \n\nThirdly, we will concatenate scalars to form final features. It is a fixed-size vector. And it is independent from the size of filters we use.\n\nFinally, we will use linear layer to project these features to per-defined labels.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/TextCNN.JPG)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n3.BERT: \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

if you feed story same as query, then it can do \n\nclassification task. \n\nTo discuss ML/DL/NLP problems and get tech support from each other, you can join QQ group: 836811304\n\nModels:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) fastText\n2) TextCNN \n3) Bert:Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding  \n4) TextRNN    \n5) RCNN     \n6) Hierarchical Attention Network    \n7) seq2seq with attention   \n8) Transformer(\"Attend Is All You Need\")\n9) Dynamic Memory Network\n10) EntityNetwork:tracking state of the world\n11) Ensemble models\n12) Boosting: \n\n    for a single model, stack identical models together. each layer is a model. the result will be based on logits added together. the only connection between layers are label's weights. the front layer's prediction error rate of each label will become weight for the next layers. those labels with high error rate will have big weight. so later layer's will pay more attention to those mis-predicted labels, and try to fix previous mistake of former layer. as a result, we will get a much strong model.\n    check a00_boosting/boosting.py\n\nand other models:\n\n1) BiLstmTextRelation;\n\n2) twoCNNTextRelation;\n\n3) BiLstmTextRelationTwoRNN\n\nPerformance\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(mulit-label label prediction task,ask to prediction top5, 3 million training data,full score:0.5)\n\nModel   | fastText|TextCNN|TextRNN| RCNN | HierAtteNet|Seq2seqAttn|EntityNet|DynamicMemory|Transformer\n---     | ---     | ---   | ---   |---   |---         |---        |---      |---          |----\nScore   | 0.362   |  0.405| 0.358 | 0.395| 0.398      |0.322      |0.400    |0.392        |0.322\nTraining| 10m     |  2h   |10h    | 2h   | 2h         |3h         |3h       |5h           |7h\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Bert model achieves 0.368 after first 9 epoch from validation set.\n \n Ensemble of TextCNN,EntityNet,DynamicMemory: 0.411\n \n Ensemble EntityNet,DynamicMemory: 0.403\n \n\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Notice: \n \n `m` stand for **minutes**;

Words are form to sentence. And sentence are form to document. In this circumstance, there may exists a intrinsic structure. So how can we model this kinds of task? Does all parts of document are equally relevant? And how we determine which part are more important than another?\n\nIt has two unique features: \n\n1)it has a hierarchical structure that reflect the hierarchical structure of documents; \n\n2)it has two levels of attention mechanisms used at the word and sentence-level. it enable the model to capture important information in different levels.\n\nWord Encoder:\nFor each words in a sentence, it is embedded into word vector in distribution vector space. It use a bidirectional GRU to encode the sentence. By concatenate vector from two direction, it now can form a representation of the sentence, which also capture contextual information.\n\nWord Attention:\nSame words are more important than another for the sentence. So attention mechanism is used. It first use one layer MLP to get uit hidden representation of the sentence, then measure the importance of the word as the similarity of uit with a word level context vector uw and get a normalized importance through a softmax function. \n\nSentence Encoder: \nfor sentence vectors, bidirectional GRU is used to encode it. Similarly to word encoder.\n\nSentence Attention: \nsentence level vector is used to measure importance among sentences. Similarly to word attention.\n\nInput of data: \n\nGenerally speaking, input of this model should have serveral sentences instead of sinle sentence. shape is:[None,sentence_lenght]. where None means the batch_size.\n\nIn my training data, for each example, i have four parts. each part has same length. i concat four parts to form one single sentence. the model will split the sentence into four parts, to form a tensor with shape:[None,num_sentence,sentence_length]. where num_sentence is number of sentences(equal to 4, in my setting).\n\ncheck:p1_HierarchicalAttention_model.py\n\nfor attentive attention you can check <a href='https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/issues/55'>attentive attention</a>\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.Seq2seq with attention\n-------------\nImplementation seq2seq with attention derived from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf\">NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION BY JOINTLY LEARNING TO ALIGN AND TRANSLATE</a>\n\nI.Structure:\n\n1)embedding 2)bi-GRU too get rich representation from source sentences(forward & backward). 3)decoder with attention.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/seq2seqAttention.JPG)\n\nII.Input of data:\n\nthere are two kinds of three kinds of inputs:1)encoder inputs, which is a sentence; 2)decoder inputs, it is labels list with fixed length;3)target labels, it is also a list of labels.\n\nfor example, labels is:\"L1 L2 L3 L4\", then decoder inputs will be:[_GO,L1,L2,L2,L3,_PAD]; target label will be:[L1,L2,L3,L3,_END,_PAD]. length is fixed to 6, any exceed labels will be trancated, will pad if label is not enough to fill.\n\nIII.Attention Mechanism:\n\n1) transfer encoder input list and hidden state of decoder\n\n2) calculate similarity of hidden state with each encoder input, to get possibility distribution for each encoder input.\n\n3) weighted sum of encoder input based on possibility distribution.\n\n   go though RNN Cell using this weight sum together with decoder input to get new hidden state\n\nIV.How Vanilla Encoder Decoder Works:\n\nthe source sentence will be encoded using RNN as fixed size vector (\"thought vector\"). then during decoder:\n\n1) when it is training, another RNN will be used to try to get a word by using this \"thought vector\"  as init state, and take input from decoder input at each timestamp. decoder start from special token \"_GO\". \nafter one step is performanced, new hidden state will be get and together with new input, we can continue this process until we reach to a special token \"_END\". \nwe can calculate loss by compute cross entropy loss of logits and target label. logits is get through a projection layer for the hidden state(for output of decoder step(in GRU we can just use hidden states from decoder as output).\n\n2) when it is testing, there is no label. so we should feed the output we get from previous timestamp, and continue the process util we reached \"_END\" TOKEN.\n\nV.Notices:\n\n1) here i use two kinds of vocabularies. one is from words,used by encoder; another is for labels,used by decoder\n\n2) for vocabulary of lables, i insert three special token:\"_GO\",\"_END\",\"_PAD\"; \"_UNK\" is not used, since all labels is pre-defined.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.Transformer(\"Attention Is All You Need\")\n-------------\nStatus: it was able to do task classification. and able to generate reverse order of its sequences in toy task. you can check it by running test function in the model. check: a2_train_classification.py(train) or a2_transformer_classification.py(model)\n\nwe do it in parallell style.layer normalization,residual connection, and mask are also used in the model. \n\nFor every building blocks, we include a test function in the each file below, and we've test each small piece successfully.\n\nSequence to sequence with attention is a typical model to solve sequence generation problem, such as translate, dialogue system. most of time, it use RNN as buidling block to do these tasks. util recently, people also apply convolutional Neural Network for sequence to sequence problem. Transformer, however, it perform these tasks solely on attention mechansim. it is fast and achieve new state-of-art result.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/attention_is_all_you_need.JPG)\n\nIt also has two main parts: encoder and decoder. below is desc from paper:\n\nEncoder:\n\n6 layers.each layers has two sub-layers.\nthe first is multi-head self-attention mechanism;\nthe second is position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\nfor each sublayer. use LayerNorm(x+Sublayer(x)). all dimension=512.\n\nDecoder:\n\n1. The decoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers.\n2. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack.\n3. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.  This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n\nMain Take away from this model:\n\n1) multi-head self attention: use self attention, linear transform multi-times to get projection of key-values, then do ordinary attention; 2) some tricks to improve performance(residual connection,position encoding, poistion feed forward, label smooth, mask to ignore things we want to ignore).\n\nUse this model to do task classification:\n\nHere we only use encode part for task classification, removed resdiual connection, used only 1 layer.no need to use mask. we use multi-head attention and postionwise feed forward to extract features of input sentence, then use linear layer to project it to get logits.\n\nfor detail of the model, please check: a2_transformer_classification.py\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.Recurrent Entity Network\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput:1. story: it is multi-sentences, as context. 2.query: a sentence, which is a question, 3. ansewr: a single label.\n\nModel Structure:\n\n1) Input encoding: use bag of word to encode story(context) and query(question); take account of position by using position mask\n\n   by using bi-directional rnn to encode story and query, performance boost from 0.392 to 0.398, increase 1.5%.\n\n2) Dynamic memory: \n\na. compute gate by using 'similarity' of keys,values with input of story. \n\nb. get candidate hidden state by transform each key,value and input.\n\nc. combine gate and candidate hidden state to update current hidden state.\n\n3) Output moudle( use attention mechanism):\na. to get possibility distribution by computing 'similarity' of query and hidden state\n\nb. get weighted sum of hidden state using possibility distribution.\n\nc. non-linearity transform of query and hidden state to get predict label.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/EntityNet.JPG)\n\nMain take away from this model:\n\n1) use blocks of keys and values, which is independent from each other. so it can be run in parallel.\n\n2) modelling context and question together. use memory to track state of world; and use non-linearity transform of hidden state and question(query) to make a prediction.\n\n3) simple model can also achieve very good performance. simple encode as use bag of word.\n\nfor detail of the model, please check: a3_entity_network.py\n\nunder this model, it has a test function, which ask this model to count numbers both for story(context) and query(question). but weights of story is smaller than query.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.Dynamic Memory Network\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOutlook of Model:\n\n1.Input Module: encode raw texts into vector representation\n\n2.Question Module: encode question into vector representation\n\n3.Episodic Memory Module: with inputs,it chooses which parts of inputs to focus on through the attention mechanism, taking into account of question and previous memory====>it poduce a 'memory' vecotr.\n\n4.Answer Module:generate an answer from the final memory vector.\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification/blob/master/images/DMN.JPG)\n\nDetail:\n\n1.Input Module:\n\n  a.single sentence: use gru to get hidden state\n  b.list of sentences: use gru to get the hidden states for each sentence. e.g. [hidden states 1,hidden states 2, hidden states...,hidden state n]\n  \n2.Question Module:\n  use gru to get hidden state\n  \n3.Episodic Memory Module:\n\n  use an attention mechanism and recurrent network to updates its memory. \n     \n  a. gate as attention mechanism:\n  \n     two-layer feed forward nueral network.input is candidate fact c,previous memory m and question q. features get by take: element-wise,matmul and absolute distance of q with c, and q with m.\n     \n  b.memory update mechanism: take candidate sentence, gate and previous hidden state, it use gated-gru to update hidden state. like: h=f(c,h_previous,g). the final hidden state is the input for answer module.\n  \n  c.need for multiple episodes===>transitive inference. \n  \n  e.g. ask where is the football? it will attend to sentence of \"john put down the football\"), then in second pass, it need to attend location of john.\n\n4.Answer Module:\ntake the final epsoidic memory, question, it update hidden state of answer module.\n\n\nTODO \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification\n\n2.Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Categorization:Shallow Word-level vs. Deep Character-level\n\n3.Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Text Classification\n\n4.Adversarial Training Methods For Semi-supervised Text Classification\n\n5.Ensemble Models\n\n\nConclusion:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDuring the process of doing large scale of multi-label classification, serveral lessons has been learned, and some list as below:\n\n1) What is most important thing to reach a high accuracy? \nIt depend the task you are doing. From the task we conducted here, we believe that ensemble models based on models trained from multiple features including word, character for title and description can help to reach very high accuarcy; However, in some cases,as just alphaGo Zero demonstrated, algorithm is more important then data or computational power, in fact alphaGo Zero did not use any humam data. \n\n2) Is there a ceiling for any specific model or algorithm?\nThe answer is yes. lots of different models were used here, we found many models have similar performances, even though there are quite different in structure. In some extent, the difference of performance is not so big.\n\n3) Is case study of error useful?\nI think it is quite useful especially when you have done many different things, but reached a limit. For example, by doing case study, you can find labels that models can make correct prediction, and where they make mistakes. And to imporove performance by  increasing weights of these wrong predicted labels or finding potential errors from data.\n\n4) How can we become expert in a specific of Machine Learning?\nIn my opinion,join a machine learning competation or begin a task with lots of data, then read papers and implement some, is a good starting point. So we will have some really experience and ideas of handling specific task, and know the challenges of it.\nBut what's more important is that we should not only follow ideas from papers, but to explore some new ideas we think may help to slove the problem. For example, by changing structures of classic models or even invent some new structures, we may able to tackle the problem in a much better way as it may more suitable for task we are doing.\n\nReference:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification\n\n2.Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n\n3.A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n\n4.Deep Learning for Chatbots, Part 2 \u2013 Implementing a Retrieval-Based Model in Tensorflow, from www.wildml.com\n\n5.Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Text Classification\n\n6.Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification\n\n7.Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\n\n8.Attention Is All You Need\n\n9.Ask Me Anything:Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing\n\n10.Tracking the state of world with recurrent entity networks\n\n11.Ensemble Selection from Libraries of Models\n\n12.<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805'>BERT:Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</a>\n\n13.<a href='https://github.com/google-research/bert'>google-research/bert</a>\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nto be continued. for any problem, concat brightmart@hotmail.com\n",
