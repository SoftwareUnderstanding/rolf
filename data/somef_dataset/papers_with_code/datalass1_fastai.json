      "excerpt": "- For a computer vision task use ImageDataBunch fastai function.  In fastai, everything you model with is going to be a DataBunch object. Basically DataBunch object contains 2 or 3 datasets - it contains your training data, validation data, and optionally test data. \n- a GPU has to apply the exact same instruction to a whole bunch of things at the same time in order to be fast. If the images are different shapes and sizes, you can't do that. So we actually have to make all of the images the same shape and size size=224. Models are designed so that the final layer is of size 7 by 7, so we actually want something where if you go 7 times 2 a bunch of times (224 = 72^5) \n- DATA AUGMENTATION: randomises cropping, flips image, resizing, and padding. \n- NORMALIZATION: channels of an image have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.  \n- Use a Learner to set up a model, such as learn = create_cnn(data, models.resnet34, metrics=error_rate) \n- ARCHITECTURE aka the model; a mathematical framework essentially. ResNet34 and ResNet50 architectures were trained on about one and a half million pictures on ImageNet data. So we can download those pre-trained weights so we start with a model that knows something: PRE-TRAINED MODEL and TRANSFER LEARNING. We can also start from scratch, see lesson 7.  \n- Fit a model using learn.fit_one_cycle(4). This number, 4, basically decides how many times do we show the dataset to the model so that it can learn from it.  \n",
