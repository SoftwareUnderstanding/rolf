      "excerpt": "In most ResNet implementations that I encountered on the web, there were additional convolutional layers used to represent the identity mappings. Even some included batch normalization layers. I believe this contradicts with the idea that deeper neural nets struggle representing identity mappings. Therefore here, I use average pooling for downsampling and add extra feature maps which contain all-zeros to increase the number of feature planes. \nWhen I work on the validation set, I noticed that identity mappings in residual blocks stabilizes the training in the long run. Yet, all trainning & validation & test accuracies tend to converge for ResNet-10 and ResNet-18. Performance gap becomes noticable when depth increases, i.e., ~2% on ResNet-34. \nDefault settings start with a learning rate of 0.1 and the learning rate is multiplied by 0.1 after every 100 epochs. \nFor computational restrictions, I trained ResNet50s with batches of size 64. \n",
