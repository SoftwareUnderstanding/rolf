Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse \u2018\u2018interstitial\u2019\u2019 pattern in both lungs. http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5 (kaggle.com) \n",

All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients\u2019 routine clinical care. \nFor the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.(kaggle.com) \n",
