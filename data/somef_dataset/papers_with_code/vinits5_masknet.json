      "excerpt": "In this work, MaskNet estimates inliers (shown on the right in blue) for a given pair of point clouds (shown on the left). MaskNet finds a Boolean vector mask that only retains inlier points from point cloud in red which most closely approximate the shape of the point cloud in green. \nWe call our method MaskNet as the network learns to 'mask-out' outliers from template (shown in red) point cloud. We demonstrate the efficiency of MaskNet as a pre-processing step in various applications (as shown below). MaskNet shows remarkable generalization within and across datasets without the need for additional fine-tuning. \n",
