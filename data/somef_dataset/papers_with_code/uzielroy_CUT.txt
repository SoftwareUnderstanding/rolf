### Based on A clean and readable Pytorch implementation of CycleGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)

You can run a training session on 30 Monet images using the following Jupiter notebook:

Its recommended that you mount your google drive for easier access to the checkpoint at the end of the training.
Kaggle dataset will be downloaded and saved.
The selected 30 Monet images (done by choosing the farthest 30 points, after dimensionality reduction) will be saved.

### Evaluation notebook:

Trained for around 20 hours.
You can view a sample of 30 style transfer pairs and the training graphs (from Tensorboard).
