The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model which can recognize between 12 different commands:  yes,  no,  up,  down,  left,  right,  on,  off,  stop,  go,  silence and unknown. Inside unknown, you are supposed to include all the commands that don't fit the first 11 classes. \n\n",
