The Fast Minimum Norm Attack (FMN), from 
Fast Minimum-norm Adversarial Attacks through Adaptive Norm Constraints.

For a quick demo example, check out [this notebook](src/fmn_example.ipynb).

For a more complete example, with different datasets and robust models, check out 
the [full example notebook](src/fmn_demo.ipynb).

Here is a conceptual figure of the attack. In summary, the algorithm performs normalized 
gradient descent and projects into an epsilon Lp-ball which is adapted to 
find the minimum norm adversarials.
