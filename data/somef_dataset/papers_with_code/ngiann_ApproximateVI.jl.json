      "excerpt": "The package is fairly easy to use. The only function of interest to the user is `VI`. At the very minimum, the user needs to provide a function that codes the joint log-likelihood function.\n\nConsider, approximating a target density given by a three-component mixture model:\n\n```\nusing PyPlot #: Necessary for this example\n\n#: Define means for three-component Gaussian mixture model\n#: All components are implicitly equally weighted and have unit covariance\n\u03bc = [zeros(2), [2.5; 0.0], [-2.5; 0.0]]\n\n#: Define log-likelihood\nlogp(\u03b8) = log(exp(-0.5*sum((\u03bc[1].-\u03b8).^2)) + exp(-0.5*sum((\u03bc[1].-\u03b8).^2)) + exp(-0.5*sum((\u03bc[3].-\u03b8).^2)))\n```\n\nWe will now approximate it with a Gaussian density. We need to pass to ```VI``` the log-likelihood function, a starting point for the mean of the approximate Gaussian posterior, as well as the number of fixed samples and the number of iterations we want to optimise the lower bound for:\n\n```\nposterior, logevidence = VI(logp, randn(2); S = 100, iterations = 30)\n```\n\nThis returns two outputs: the first one is the approximating posterior q(\u03b8) of type ```MvNormal``` (see [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)). The second output is the approximate lower bound of type ```Float64```.\n\nBelow we plot as contour plot the target unnormalised posterior distribution.\nWe also plot the approximating posterior q(\u03b8) as a blue ellipse:\n\n![image](docs/images/examplemixturemodel_ellipse.png)\n\n\n",
