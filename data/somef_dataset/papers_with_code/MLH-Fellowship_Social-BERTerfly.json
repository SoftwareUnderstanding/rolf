We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:\n\nReporting a bug\nDiscussing the current state of the code\nSubmitting a fix\nProposing new features\nBecoming a maintainer\n\nWe Develop with Github\nWe use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.\nWe Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests\nPull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:\n\nFork the repo and create your branch from main.\nIf you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\nIf you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\nEnsure the test suite passes.\nMake sure your code lints.\nIssue that pull request!\n\nAny contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\nReport bugs using Github's issues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!\nWrite bug reports with detail, background, and sample code\nGreat Bug Reports tend to have:\n\nA quick summary and/or background\nSteps to reproduce\nBe specific!\nGive sample code if you can.\nWhat you expected would happen\nWhat actually happens\nNotes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n\nUse a Consistent Coding Style\nFacebook's Guidelines\n\n2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs\nYou can try running npm run lint for style unification\n\nLicense\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.\nReferences\nThis document was adapted from the open-source contribution guidelines for Facebook's Draft",

This was a model of 8 distinct functions, thought processes or ways of thinking that were suggested to be present in the mind. Later this work was transformed into several different personality systems to make it more accessible, the most popular of which is of course the MBTI. \nFor the dataset, we have used the famous Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset that includes a large number of people's MBTI type and content written by them. \nThis dataset contains over 8600 rows of data, on each row is a person\u2019s: \n",

BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. As of 2019, Google has been leveraging BERT to better understand user searches. \nUsing tweepy and Twitter API, we fetch the 50 latest tweets posted by the user according to the username entered. These tweets are stored in a .csv file and sent for preprocessing, and finally the cleaned texts are sent to the Keras model. \nWe have used regex to detect special characters like '@,emojis' etc. from the posts, remove stopwords and punctuation, convert the text to lowercase and stemming to extract the root of words. The preprocessed data is split using train_test split and sent to the Keras model for predictions. \nWe tested using a LSTM model, and BERT-base to contrast accuracies. \n",
