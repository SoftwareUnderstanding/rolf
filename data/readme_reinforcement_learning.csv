Reinforcement Learning;ddpgcnnpendulum used cnn ddpg realizing inverted pendulum control python35 tensorflow gpu gym环境 写在前面 这个只是一个最简单的测试代码，主要是验证算法是否可行。 ataria游戏使用了卷积神经网络来进行实现，但是针对于gym下的机器人控制直接使用的是全连接网络，根本没有考虑使用卷积神经网络；再次查阅baselines（opneai旗下的git）其中使用ppo与ddpg在用于连续动作的时候调用网络的时候使用的是mlp，在用于离散动作（针对于ataria游戏：breakout、pong等）时仅在ppo中调用了cnn网络，其他均使用的是mlp。 但是在离散动作，使用卷积神经网络时尽量选择dqn，我们使用dqn cnn 可以实现想要的结果，转化为连续型时用ddpg以及ppo cnn均没有训练出结果 代码解释 其中cnn1与cnn2是根据全连接进行改造的 cnn1中是在第二个卷积层的输出中加入actor网络的输出policy cnn2中是在地一个全连接的输出中加入actor网络的输出policy 两个版本最后运行的结果都不太理想，卷积网路所使用的图像是使用pygame进行绘制的。 对于全连接网络来说，网络的输入有（角度的cos值，角度的sin值，角速度） 而卷积神经网络，我只使用了角度信息进行绘制，角速度信息没有使用到。 继续修改plot代码，进行训练。 添加了角速度的信息，以摆杆的支点为圆心画圆，当速度越大，半径越大，且具有方向信息，顺时针与逆时针使用颜色进行区分。

Reinforcement Learning;📈 如何用深度强化学习自动炒股 💡 初衷 最近一段时间，受到新冠疫情的影响，股市接连下跌，作为一棵小白菜兼小韭菜，竟然产生了抄底的大胆想法，拿出仅存的一点私房钱梭哈了一把。 第二天，暴跌，俺加仓 第三天，又跌，俺加仓 第三天，又跌，俺又加仓 img srcimg20200327104559png altdrawing width50 一番错误操作后，结果惨不忍睹，第一次买股票就被股市一段暴打，受到了媳妇无情的嘲讽。痛定思痛，俺决定换一个思路：如何用深度强化学习来自动模拟炒股？ 实验验证一下能否获得收益。 📖 监督学习与强化学习的区别 监督学习（如 lstm）可以根据各种历史数据来预测未来的股票的价格，判断股票是涨还是跌，帮助人做决策。 img srcimg20200325185513png altdrawing width50 而强化学习是机器学习的另一个分支，在决策的时候采取合适的行动 action 使最后的奖励最大化。与监督学习预测未来的数值不同，强化学习根据输入的状态（如当日开盘价、收盘价等），输出系列动作（例如：买进、持有、卖出），使得最后的收益最大化，实现自动交易。 img srcimg20200325181903png altdrawing width50 🤖 openai gym 股票交易环境 观测 observation 策略网络观测的就是一只股票的各项参数，比如开盘价、收盘价、成交数量等。部分数值会是一个很大的数值，比如成交金额或者成交量，有可能百万、千万乃至更大，为了训练时网络收敛，观测的状态数据输入时，必须要进行归一化，变换到 1 1 的区间内。 参数名称参数描述说明 date交易所行情日期格式：yyyymmdd code证券代码格式：sh600000。sh：上海，sz：深圳 open今开盘价格精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 high最高价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 low最低价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 close今收盘价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 preclose昨日收盘价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 volume成交数量单位：股 amount成交金额精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 adjustflag复权状态不复权、前复权、后复权 turn换手率精度：小数点后6位；单位： tradestatus交易状态1：正常交易 0：停牌 pctchg涨跌幅（百分比）精度：小数点后6位 pettm滚动市盈率精度：小数点后6位 psttm滚动市销率精度：小数点后6位 pcfncfttm滚动市现率精度：小数点后6位 pbmrq市净率精度：小数点后6位 动作 action 假设交易共有买入、卖出和保持 3 种操作，定义动作action为长度为 2 的数组 action0 为操作类型； action1 表示买入或卖出百分比； 动作类型 action0 说明 1 买入 action1 2 卖出 action1 3 保持 注意，当动作类型 action0 3 时，表示不买也不抛售股票，此时 action1 的值无实际意义，网络在训练过程中，agent 会慢慢学习到这一信息。 奖励 reward 奖励函数的设计，对强化学习的目标至关重要。在股票交易的环境下，最应该关心的就是当前的盈利情况，故用当前的利润作为奖励函数。即当前本金 股票价值 初始本金 利润。 python profit reward selfnetworth initialaccountbalance reward 1 reward 0 else reward 100 为了使网络更快学习到盈利的策略，当利润为负值时，给予网络一个较大的惩罚 100。 策略梯度 因为动作输出的数值是连续，因此使用基于策略梯度的优化算法，其中比较知名的是 ppo 和许多文献已把 ppo 作为强化学习研究中首选的算法。ppo 优化算法 python 实现参考 using proximal policy optimization algorithm ppo2 version optimized gpu actorcritic method us value function improve policy gradient descent reducing variance combine idea a2c multiple worker using entropy bonus exploration trpo us trust region improve stability avoid catastrophic drop performance ppo onpolicy algorithm mean trajectory used update network must collected using latest policy usually le sample efficient offpolicy alorithms like dqn sac td3 much faster regarding wallclock time 🕵️‍♀️ 模拟实验 环境安装 sh 虚拟环境 virtualenv p python36 venv source venvbinactivate 安装库依赖 pip install r requirementstxt 股票数据获取 股票证券数据集来自于 python api。 bash pip install baostock trustedhost pypitunatsinghuaeducn 数据获取代码参考 python python getstockdatapy 将过去 20 多年的股票数据划分为训练集，和末尾 1 个月数据作为测试集，来验证强化学习策略的有效性。划分如下 19900101 20191129 20191201 20191231 训练集 测试集 验证结果 单只股票 初始本金 10000 股票代码：sh600036招商银行 训练集： stockdatatrainsh600036招商银行csv 测试集： stockdatatestsh600036招商银行csv 模拟操作 20 天，最终盈利约 400 img srcimgsh600036png altdrawing width70 多只股票 选取 1002 只股票，进行训练，共计 盈利： 445 不亏不赚： 465 亏损：90 img srcimgpiepng altdrawing width50 img srcimghistpng altdrawing width50 👻 最后 股票 gym 环境主要参考 俺完全是股票没入门的新手，难免存在错误，欢迎指正！ 数据和方法皆来源于网络，无法保证有效性，just fun！ 📚 参考资料 deng f bao kong z ren q dai deep direct reinforcement learning financial signal representation trading ieee transaction neural network learning system vol 28 3 pp 653664 march 2017 yuqin dai chris wang iris wang yilun xu reinforcement learning fx chien yi huang financial trading game deep reinforcement learning approach arxiv preprint arxiv180702787 2018 create custom gym environment scratch — stock market welcome stable baseline doc rl baseline made

Reinforcement Learning;inteligencia artificial uso de ferramentas de inteligência artificial não é recente ma verdade é que com maior acessibilidade software e pacotes que permitem uso de modelos mais elaborados na área juntamente com redução do custos de processamento e armazenamento criouse ambiente perfeito para impulsionar essa ciência aplicações são várias indo desde modelos de previsão para mercado financeiro até sistemas inteligentes que estão revolucionando que entendemos como iteração com máquinas sem ter intuito de esgotar debate sobre tema esse projeto procura agrupar diversos notebook python com exemplos de uso de ferramentas que envolvem duas importantes áreas da inteligência artificial machine learning e deep learning classificação um problema de classificação envolve uma variável que contém class label e onde modelo de previsão procura aproximar partir de uma função específica variáveis de input conjunto de variáveis de output que são class o modelos de classificação em inteligência artificial são denominados de aprendizado supervisionado supervised learning alguns algoritmos usados em classificação há diversos algoritmos em machine learning e deep learning que podem ser utilizados para problemas de classificação e fica difícil dizer qual deles performa melhor o resultados irão depender tipo de problema que estamos avaliando e comportamento do dado abaixo discutimos rapidamente sobre alguns des algoritmos árvore de decisão decision tree dt nesse tipo de algoritmo denominado de método de aprendizado supervisionado não paramétrico temos que decisões sobre processo de classificação ocorrem formato de árvore onde partimos de uma visão topdown decisões são feitas com base ifthenelse e é um algoritmo de fácil implementação e interpretação ma é muito sensível problemas de classificação tipo imbalanced onde uma classe tem mais dado que outra nesse caso recomendase fazer um rebalanceamento da proporções do dado ante de implementar algoritmo outro problema com dt é quando temos muitas variáveis que representam características input e que podem gerar um overfit do dado support vector machine svm esse método é muito eficiente em problemas de aprendizado supervisionado e pode ser aplicado tanto para regressão classificação quanto para detecção de outlier uma da vantagens uso svm é que temos diversos parâmetros que podem ser controlados em especial função kernel que irá produzir divisão da class naive bayes nb esse algoritmo é baseado teorema de bayes e usado em problemas de aprendizado supervisionado assumindo que existe uma independência condicional entre o pares de valores da características e class esse algoritmo pode ser usado com poucos dado de treino e para diversos problemas reais acaba produzindo resultados satisfatórios ele é muito utilizado para classificação de texto em análises tipo nlp partir da hipeotese de dado com distribuição multinomial ensemble esse é um método utilizado para otimizar resultado da aplicação de diferentes algoritmos ideia é combinar diversos estimadores em apenas um isso pode ser feito de três formas fazendo uma média de todos o estimadores usados ou seja selecionamos diferentes amostras podemos fazer isso partir de doi modos usando bagging baggingclassifier ou forest randomized tree com randomforestclassifier ou extratreeclassifier ii usa o estimadores de forma sequencial boosting method com objetivo de reduzir viés estimador combinado podemos fazer isso partir de doi modos primeiro usando algoritmo adaboost ou então via gradient tree boosting que possui vantagem de ser um algoritmo robusto presença de outilier e tem boa capacidade de previsão e por fim podemos usar iii “voting classifier” aqui aplicamos diferentes algoritmos de classificação e usamos um método de votação da maioria para escolher class que serão previstas recomendase uso desse algoritmo para selecionar dentre diferentes modelos quando temos várias boa opções reinforcement learning esse tema também classificado na classe de modelos de inteligência artificial explora uma forma diferente de aprendizado onde temos um agente que aprende com mudanças que ocorrem ambiente em que se encontra e seria uma mistura entre deep learning e reinforcement learning esse desenho acaba por gerar uma gama de aplicações interessantes como carros autônomos jogos estratégias de marketing dentre outras veja que tanto o modelos de machine learning quanto o de deep learning são processos de aprendizado ma com foco em encontrar padrões no dado por outro lado o modelos de rl reinforcement learning atuam com tentativa e erro para aprender com o dado e criamos uma recompensa pelo acerto que acaba criando como objetivo maximização dessa receita isso posto podemos definir quais são peças que vão fazer parte da construção de um modelo de rl 1 estado descreve situaçao qual agente se encontra 2 açoes esta relacionado ao conjunto de possibilidades de decisao que agente pode fazer 3 ambiente descreve caracteristicas local onde agente interage cada ambiente possui caracteristicas recompensa e acoes diferentes 4 recompensa nossa funçao objetivo que ira influenciar algoritmo dependendo estado atual e futuro e da acao 5 politicas conjunto de regras que define escolhas agente para suas acoes agent brain um do paper mais famosos nesse tema foi publicado em 2013 pelo time de pesquisa google google deepmind playing atari deep reinforcement learning artigo é introduzido algoritmo deep q network onde temos funçao qsa que depende de doi parâmetos estado e açao qlearning procura aprender com valor que é atribuído um dado estado que é resultado da escolha de uma ação e isso irá influenciar na decisão ação seguinte esse não seria único método de políticas que governam ações do agentes outro exemplo nessa linha seria método gradiente onde mapeamos melhor função relacionada uma ação uma da características qlearning é que podemos regular decisões agente com base em parâmetros que irão dizer se foco seria uma recompensa de curto ou de longo prazo uma visão simple qlearning seria imaginar uma tabela que contém recompensa para cada uma da combinações entre o possíveis estados linhas e possíveis ações colunas que são especificadas que denominamos de ambiente se temos 100 possíveis estados e 5 diferentes ações em cada momento temos uma qtable de 100x5500 valores serem analisados veja que para problemas de menor magnitude de estados uso da qtable para avaliar aprendizado se torna factível ma para aplicações onde temos muito mais estados matriz qtable seria impraticável nesse ponto passamos usar redes neurais processo de aprendizado vantagem de usar redes neurais para solução aprendizado é que passamos ter possibilidade de aplicar qualquer número de estados na análise para tanto usamos o estados como input que irá ter como output o resultados de valores em qvalues diferença que surge agora nesse processo é que ante com qtable processo de atualização era feito diretamente na tabela agora usamos uma função perda e princípio backpropagation para fazer essa atualização com vantagem de termos flexibilidade de inserir mais layer mudar função de ativação quantidade de input e própria função perda abaixo está uma extensa lista de opções de leitura sobre tema rl algumas referencias sobre rl br extensa lista de publicacoes vale pena ver br livro sobre rl br um tutorial simple br br br br br br br br br br br br br

Reinforcement Learning;📈 如何用深度强化学习自动炒股 💡 初衷 最近一段时间，受到新冠疫情的影响，股市接连下跌，作为一棵小白菜兼小韭菜，竟然产生了抄底的大胆想法，拿出仅存的一点私房钱梭哈了一把。 第二天，暴跌，俺加仓 第三天，又跌，俺加仓 第三天，又跌，俺又加仓 img srcimg20200327104559png altdrawing width50 一番错误操作后，结果惨不忍睹，第一次买股票就被股市一段暴打，受到了媳妇无情的嘲讽。痛定思痛，俺决定换一个思路：如何用深度强化学习来自动模拟炒股？ 实验验证一下能否获得收益。 📖 监督学习与强化学习的区别 监督学习（如 lstm）可以根据各种历史数据来预测未来的股票的价格，判断股票是涨还是跌，帮助人做决策。 img srcimg20200325185513png altdrawing width50 而强化学习是机器学习的另一个分支，在决策的时候采取合适的行动 action 使最后的奖励最大化。与监督学习预测未来的数值不同，强化学习根据输入的状态（如当日开盘价、收盘价等），输出系列动作（例如：买进、持有、卖出），使得最后的收益最大化，实现自动交易。 img srcimg20200325181903png altdrawing width50 🤖 openai gym 股票交易环境 观测 observation 策略网络观测的就是一只股票的各项参数，比如开盘价、收盘价、成交数量等。部分数值会是一个很大的数值，比如成交金额或者成交量，有可能百万、千万乃至更大，为了训练时网络收敛，观测的状态数据输入时，必须要进行归一化，变换到 1 1 的区间内。 参数名称参数描述说明 date交易所行情日期格式：yyyymmdd code证券代码格式：sh600000。sh：上海，sz：深圳 open今开盘价格精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 high最高价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 low最低价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 close今收盘价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 preclose昨日收盘价精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 volume成交数量单位：股 amount成交金额精度：小数点后4位；单位：人民币元 adjustflag复权状态不复权、前复权、后复权 turn换手率精度：小数点后6位；单位： tradestatus交易状态1：正常交易 0：停牌 pctchg涨跌幅（百分比）精度：小数点后6位 pettm滚动市盈率精度：小数点后6位 psttm滚动市销率精度：小数点后6位 pcfncfttm滚动市现率精度：小数点后6位 pbmrq市净率精度：小数点后6位 动作 action 假设交易共有买入、卖出和保持 3 种操作，定义动作action为长度为 2 的数组 action0 为操作类型； action1 表示买入或卖出百分比； 动作类型 action0 说明 1 买入 action1 2 卖出 action1 3 保持 注意，当动作类型 action0 3 时，表示不买也不抛售股票，此时 action1 的值无实际意义，网络在训练过程中，agent 会慢慢学习到这一信息。 奖励 reward 奖励函数的设计，对强化学习的目标至关重要。在股票交易的环境下，最应该关心的就是当前的盈利情况，故用当前的利润作为奖励函数。即当前本金 股票价值 初始本金 利润。 python profit reward selfnetworth initialaccountbalance reward 1 reward 0 else reward 100 为了使网络更快学习到盈利的策略，当利润为负值时，给予网络一个较大的惩罚 100。 策略梯度 因为动作输出的数值是连续，因此使用基于策略梯度的优化算法，其中比较知名的是 ppo 和许多文献已把 ppo 作为强化学习研究中首选的算法。ppo 优化算法 python 实现参考 🕵️‍♀️ 模拟实验 环境安装 sh 虚拟环境 virtualenv p python36 venv source venvbinactivate 安装库依赖 pip install r requirementstxt 股票数据获取 股票证券数据集来自于 python api。 bash pip install baostock trustedhost pypitunatsinghuaeducn 数据获取代码参考 python python getstockdatapy 将过去 20 多年的股票数据划分为训练集，和末尾 1 个月数据作为测试集，来验证强化学习策略的有效性。划分如下 19900101 20191129 20191201 20191231 训练集 测试集 验证结果 单只股票 初始本金 10000 股票代码：sh600036招商银行 训练集： stockdatatrainsh600036招商银行csv 测试集： stockdatatestsh600036招商银行csv 模拟操作 20 天，最终盈利约 400 img srcimgsh600036png altdrawing width70 多只股票 选取 1002 只股票，进行训练，共计 盈利： 445 不亏不赚： 465 亏损：90 img srcimgpiepng altdrawing width50 img srcimghistpng altdrawing width50 👻 最后 股票 gym 环境主要参考 俺完全是股票没入门的新手，难免存在错误，欢迎指正！ 数据和方法皆来源于网络，无法保证有效性，just fun！ 📚 参考资料 deng f bao kong z ren q dai deep direct reinforcement learning financial signal representation trading ieee transaction neural network learning system vol 28 3 pp 653664 march 2017 yuqin dai chris wang iris wang yilun xu reinforcement learning fx chien yi huang financial trading game deep reinforcement learning approach arxiv preprint arxiv180702787 2018 create custom gym environment scratch — stock market welcome stable baseline doc rl baseline made

user input keyboard log may 17 2020 ai drive mostly run wall seems almost always go straight everything present focused getting something running thats done time play different deep learning image processing technique followup realized car inputting one key time isnt ideal since racing driver often use multiple input time eg trailbraking fixed changing final dense layer activation function softmax sigmoid may 18 2020 initial cleanup codebase noticed test prediction identical great donut learns nothing press gas turn left fixed initializing weight fc layer small random value changed alexnetinspired architecture layer maxpooling decreased many setting get around 13000 trainable parameter noticed car hard time anytime went track wall added pause functionality could pause training go track unpause teach ai go back track switched rx7 brand hatch ford focus washington hill circuit switched rwd fwd ai wouldnt deal throttleon oversteer swtiched track somewhere clear wall boundary result ai clearly turning correct course still cant make meter running wall completely turning around may 19 2020 sat gathered around 20000 training sample ai clearly exhibiting intelligent behavior typically making least hundred meter anything crazy par id expect given experience gathered training example first get close wall crashed unpaused training backed restarted course ai learned although might many training example like ai sometimes back unnecessary maybe still need training data maybe need balanced another option add lstm layer give sense memory ive started thinking reinforcement learning paradigm reward function first thought coming reward function would difficult since want use purely visual input dont want pull anything game internal code want package game agnostic one option look specific place screen read number could serve reward function eg look speedometer parse speed try maximize average speed one option there another like better try maximize optic flow human vision one thing lead sense speed better yet already implemented opencv although single point use generate global optical flow rate opencv optical flow optical flow human vision may 23 2020 moved reinforcement learning dqn much help medium original reward function based optical flow optical flow every pixel calculated following value added together average leftward flow left side image average rightward flow right side image downward flow goal capture visuals moving forward space higher optical flow associated higher rate travel idea maximizing forward rate travel unfortunately ai learned hack system large overall optical flow come slamming wall ai learned turn sideways run wall reverse wall repeat process maximize jolt optical flow get camera shake hitting wall idea fix smooth overall flow avoid short jolt tune gamma towards longer term goal week may 23 moved speed reward function using pytesseract read onscreen speedometer ran rl 100000 frame didnt seem learn much roadmap
