# CubeViz - THE RDF DATACUBE BROWSER 

CubeViz is an [OntoWiki](http://aksw.org/Projects/OntoWiki.html) component providing faceted browsing in statistical 
data in the Linked Data Web. It was set up and adopted to be part of the 
[Data Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/scoreboard) of the European Union. 
CubeViz utilizing the  [RDF DataCube vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) 
which is the state-of-the-art in representing statistical data in [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://www.w3.org/RDF/). 
This vocabulary is compatible with [SDMX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDMX) 
([User Guide](http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SDMX_2-1_User_Guide_draft_0-1.pdf)) and increasingly being adopted. 
Based on the vocabulary and the encoded Data Cube, CubeViz is generating a facetted browsing widget that 
can be used to filter interactively observations to be visualized in charts. 
Based on the selected structure, CubeViz offer beneficiary chart types and options which can be selected by users.

## Getting started

You will find various information in our [Wiki](https://github.com/AKSW/cubeviz.ontowiki/wiki/Home).
For new users, please visit Page [installation](https://github.com/AKSW/cubeviz.ontowiki/wiki/Installation-and-setup-main) 
to get an introduction about installation and setup of CubeViz.

Further information about the repository structure or other internals can be also found in the Wiki.

### Docker container available

We providing a Docker container for everybody, who don't want to bother about getting OntoWiki running or struggles with Virtuoso. That container only needs a Docker and can be used with `docker pull` + `docker run`. How easy is that?! 

Basically it ships with a fully fledged OntoWiki, pre-filled Virtuoso store and up and running CubeViz. After you started the container, you can use your browser and directly use CubeViz.

To pull the container just run: 

`docker pull aksw/dld-present-cubeviz`

To run it, please use:

`docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8890:8890 aksw/dld-present-cubeviz`

For further information, please look in following the project page.

## CubeViz compared to other tools

*(Last updated 2015-11-30)*

We created a comparison of CubeViz and other tools, which are supporting DataCube vocabulary. It is based on the support of elements which are mentioned in the vocabulary. The purpose of that overview is to provide users, who are interested in using CubeViz, further information of its DataCube vocabulary support in comparison to other tools.

*If you encounter erros or wanna mention something, please make a pull request, create an issue or send us an email.*

## Missing support of the Data Cube vocabulary

The following list contains all elements of the DataCube vocabulary which are not supported by CubeViz (yet):


  *	**qb:ObservationGroup**: Indicates a group of observations. The domain of this property is left open so that a group may be attached to different resources and need not be restricted to a single DataSet.  
  *	**qb:CodedProperty**: Superclass of all coded component properties.  
  *	**qb:HierarchicalCodeList**: Represents a generalized hierarchy of concepts which can be used for coding. The hierarchy is defined by one or more roots together with a property which relates concepts in the hierarchy to their child concept . The same concepts may be members of multiple hierarchies provided that different qb:parentChildProperty values are used for each hierarchy.
  *	**qb:hierarchyRoot**: Specifies a root of the hierarchy. A hierarchy may have multiple roots but must have at least one.
  *	**qb:parentChildProperty**: Specifies a property which relates a parent concept in the hierarchy to a child concept. Note that a child may have more than one parent.
  *	**qb:componentAttachment**: Indicates the level at which the component property should be attached, this might be an qb:DataSet, qb:Slice or qb:Observation, or a qb:MeasureProperty.
  *	**qb:componentRequired:** Indicates whether a component property is required (true) or optional (false) in the context of a DSD. Only applicable to components corresponding to an attribute. Defaults to false (optional).  
  *	**qb:order**: Indicates a priority order for the components of sets with this structure, used to guide presentations - lower order numbers come before higher numbers, un-numbered components come last.
  *	**qb:concept**: Gives the concept which is being measured or indicated by a ComponentProperty.
  *	SKOS or SDMX related entities.
