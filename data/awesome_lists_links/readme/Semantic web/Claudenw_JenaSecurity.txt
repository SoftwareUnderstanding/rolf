Security (Permissions) wrapper around Jena RDF implementation.

By implementing a SecurityEvaluator users may apply access restricitons to graphs and optionally
to triples within the graphs.

Two implementations are available based on Jena 2.7.4 and another on the upcoming 2.10.0

Documentation is most complete for the 2.10.0 version, however most of that documentation will
also apply to 2.7.4.
