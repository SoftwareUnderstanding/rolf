Ontodia is a JavaScript library that allows to visualize, navigate and explore data in the form of an interactive graph based on underlying data sources.

## What is Ontodia for?

Ontodia allows you to create and persist diagrams made from existing data - relational, object, semantic.

It was designed to visualize RDF data sets in particular, but could be tailored to almost any data source by implementing a data provider interface.  

## Core features

- Visual navigation and diagramming over large graph data sets
- Rich graph visualization and context-aware navigation features 
- Ability to store and retrieve diagrams
- User friendly - no graph query language or prior knowledge of the schema required
- Customizable user interface (by modifying templates for nodes and links) and data storage back-end
