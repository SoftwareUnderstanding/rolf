Welcome to the Ripple wiki!
Ripple is a functional, stack-based query language for Linked Data and other RDF data sources.
Ripple programs resemble path expressions as in [XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/)
and postfix-style procedures as in
[Forth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_&#40;programming_language\&#41;).
Every program has an [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) representation,
so you can embed programs in the Web of Data as well as querying against it.
The implementation is written in Java and includes an interactive command-line interpreter as well as a query API which interoperates with [Sesame 4.1](http://rdf4j.org/).
