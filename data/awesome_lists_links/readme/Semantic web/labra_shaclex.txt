## Introduction

This project contains an implementation of [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and [ShEx](http://shex.io/).

Both are implemented in Scala using the same underlying mechanism using a purely functional approach.

The library handles RDF using a
[simple RDF library](https://github.com/weso/srdf)
which has 2 implementations,
one using [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/)
and another one using [RDF4j](http://rdf4j.org/),
this means that it is possible to use this library to validate RDF models from any of those RDF libraries, 
as well as from external SPARQL endpoints.

## Installation and compilation

The project uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) for compilation as well as Java 1.8.

* `sbt test` compiles and runs the tests

## Command line usage

Once compiled, the program can be run as a command line tool.
It is possible to run the program inside `sbt` as:

### Validating RDF data with SHACL

Example:

```sh
sbt "run --data examples/shacl/good1.ttl \
         --engine shaclex \
         --showValidationReport"
```

It is also possible to use [Jena SHACL](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/) using:  

```sh
sbt "run --data examples/shacl/good1.ttl \
         --engine JenaSHACL \
         --showValidationReport"
```

or [Top Braid SHACL API] using:

```sh
sbt "run --data examples/shacl/good1.ttl \
         --engine shacl-tq \
         --showValidationReport"
```


### Validating RDF with ShEx 

Example:

```sh
sbt "run --engine=ShEx 
         --schema examples/shex/good1.shex 
         --schemaFormat ShExC 
         --data examples/shex/good1.ttl"
```

### Validating RDF data through an SPARQL endpoint

The following example validates RDF nodes from wikidata using [Gene-wiki ShEx](https://github.com/SuLab/Genewiki-ShEx):

```sh
sbt "run --endpoint=https://query.wikidata.org/sparql 
         --schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuLab/Genewiki-ShEx/master/diseases/wikidata-disease-ontology.shex 
         --shapeMap=examples/shex/wikidata/disease1.shapeMap 
         --schemaFormat=ShExC 
         --engine=ShEx 
         --trigger=ShapeMap 
         --showResult 
         --resultFormat=JSON"
```
   
 
### Interactive mode with `sbt` 

It is usually faster to run the `sbt` command, which opens the interactive `sbt` shell and inside that shell, execute 
the different commands. 

```sh
$ sbt
... several information about loading libraries
sbt> run -d examples/shacl/good1.ttl --engine ShaClex  
```

### Binary mode

The fastest way to run Shaclex is to compile the code and generate a comand line binary file. 

The following command will generate a binary file:

```sh
$ sbt universal:packageBin
...generates the file...
target/universal/shaclex-N.N.N.zip
```

which contains the compressed binary code.

## Programmatic usage

The Shaclex library can be invoked programmatically.

* [Simple project validating ShEx](https://github.com/weso/simpleShExScala)
* Simple example validating SHACL

## Implementation details

* The engine is based on Monads using the [cats library](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
* The ShEx compact syntax parser
  is implemented using the following [Antlr grammar](https://github.com/shexSpec/grammar/blob/master/ShExDoc.g4) (previous versions used Scala Parser Combinators)
  which is based on this [grammar](https://github.com/shexSpec/shex.js/blob/master/doc/bnf)
* JSON encoding and decoding uses the Json structure [defined here](https://shexspec.github.io/spec/) and is implemented using [Circe](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe)

## Compatibility tests

The current implementation passes all [shacl-core tests](https://w3c.github.io/data-shapes/data-shapes-test-suite/). 
 In order to generate the EARL report, run: 
 
```
$ sbt 
[...]
sbt:shaclex> project shacl 
sbt:shacl> testOnly es.weso.shacl.report.ReportGeneratorCompatTest
```
 
We also aim to pass the [ShEx test-suite](https://github.com/shexSpec/shexTest).

In order to run the shex test-suite and generate the EARL report, you can do the following:

```
sbt
...
sbt:shaclex> project shex
sbt:shex> compat:test
```

## Convert between Schema formats

Shaclex can be used to convert between different schema formats. 
The following example shows how to convert between ShExC to ShExJ:

```
$ sbt "run --schema examples/shex/good1.shex 
           --schemaFormat ShExC
           --outSchemaFormat ShExJ
           --showSchema"
```

## Convert between ShEx and SHACL

Shaclex can be used to convert schemas from ShEx to SHACL and viceversa. 
 The following example shows how to convert a SHACL schema to ShEx. 

```
$ sbt "run --schema examples/shacl/good1.ttl 
           --schemaFormat Turtle 
           --outSchemaFormat ShExC 
           --engine SHACLEX 
           --outEngine SHEX 
           --showSchema 
           --no-validate"
```

The conversion code is work in progress. This [issue tracks ShEx->SHACL conversion](https://github.com/weso/shaclex/issues/114) and this one tracks [SHACL->ShEx 
 conversion](https://github.com/weso/shaclex/issues/113). 


## Clingo validation

The project supports experimental Answer Set Programming based validation by converting the validation process to a [Clingo program])(https://potassco.org/clingo/). To run this, use the option `--showClingo` which will generate a Cling program. Example:

```sh
sbt "run --engine=ShEx 
         --schema examples/shex/good1.shex 
         --schemaFormat ShExC 
         --data examples/shex/good1.ttl
         --showClingo
         --clingoFile clingoProgram.pl" 
```

Once you generate the Clingo program and have installed Clingo itself, you can run the program with:

```sh
clingo clingoProgram.pl
```

This feature is experimental. This [issue tracks the Clingo conversion](https://github.com/weso/shaclex/issues/316).

## More information

* The aim of Shaclex is to support both ShEx and SHACL and to provide conversions between both languages. 
  More information about both languages can be read in the [Validating RDF data](http://book.validatingrdf.com) written by the authors.
* An online demo based on this library is available at [http://rdfshape.weso.es](http://rdfshape.weso.es).
* Another online demo based on this library customized for Wikidata is available at [http://wikidata.weso.es](http://wikidata.weso.es).
* This project was based on [ShExcala](http://labra.github.io/ShExcala/) which was focused on Shape Expressions only.
