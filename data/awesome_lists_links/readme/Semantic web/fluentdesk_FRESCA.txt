The FRESH Resume Schema
======
*A rational schema for your résumé or CV. Based on [FRESH][f].*

The [FRESH résumé schema][fresh] is an open source, standards-friendly,
JSON/YAML-driven format for résumé / CVs and other employment artifacts.

- [**View the official FRESH schema document.**][schema]
- [**View a sample FRESH resume.**][exemplar]

FRESH is supported natively by [HackMyResume][hmr] and can be trivially
converted to and from the [JSON Resume][jrs] format.

## What It Does

FRESCA establishes an optimized, human-readable, computer-friendly
representation for your résumé and career data based on JSON or equivalent
YAML...

```js
// Pared-down FRESH/FRESCA resume representation (JSON)
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "info": { /* Basic info */ },
  "contact": { /* Contact information */ },
  "location": { /* Location / address */ },
  "meta": { /* Resume metadata */ },
  "employment": { /* Employment history */ },
  "projects": [ /* Project history */ ],
  "skills": [ /* Skills and technologies */ ],
  "education": { /* Schools, training, certifications */ },
  "affiliation": { /* Clubs, groups, and associations */ },
  "service": { /* Volunteer, military, civilian service */ },
  "disposition": { /* Disposition towards work, relocation, schedule */ },
  "writing": [ /* Writing, blogging, and publications */ ],
  "reading": [ /* Books and publication a la StackOverflow Careers */ ],
  "speaking": [ /* Writing, blogging, and publications */ ],
  "governance": [ /* Board memberships, committees, standards groups */ ],
  "recognition": [ /* Awards and commendations */ ],
  "samples": [ /* Work samples and portfolio pieces */ ],
  "social": [ /* Social networking & engagement */ ],
  "references": [ /* Candidate references */ ],
  "testimonials": [ /* Public candidate testimonials */ ],  
  "extracurricular": [ /* Interests & hobbies */ ],
  "interests": [ /* Interests & hobbies */ ],
  "languages": [ /* languages spoken */ ]
}
```

...which you can use to generate resumes and other career artifacts in specific
concrete formats (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, PDF, etc.) as well as enable
21st-century analysis of your resume and career data in a way that's not
possible with traditional, 20th-century resume tools and formats.
