=======
A tool-suite for Linked Data consumption. **balloon** aims in offering public services and tools to take advantage of the semantic web with less effort.
The basic motivation is to establish a foundation for Linked Data as a Service (**LDaaS**). 

**!!! The project is currently under development and will be available soon !!!**

#Overview
Today’s vision of a common Web of Data is mostly achieved and coined by the Linked Open Data movement. The first wave of this movement transformed silo-based portions of data into a plethora of open accessible and interlinked data sets. The community itself provided guidelines (e.g., 5 ★ Open Data ) as well as open source tools to foster interactions with the Web of data. Harmonization between those data sets has been established at the modeling level with unified description schemes characterizing a formal syntax and common data semantic. Without doubt, Linked Open Data is the de-facto standard to publish and interlink distributed data sets in the Web commonly exposed in SPARQL endpoints. However, a convenient request considering the globally described data set is only possible with strong limitations. **balloon** wants to overcome this issue by providing a large choice of services to simplify utilizing the web of data for your projects. We think that Linked Data tools should be available as a service (**LDaaS**), to avoid high setup and integration costs and data duplication. Therefore all balloon services will be public available and don't need to be installed locally.
