RDFAgents is a messaging protocol for real-time, peer-to-peer knowledge sharing on the Semantic Web. It patterned after, and designed to interoperate with Linked Data, but extends Linked Data principles to support a "word of mouth" style of information discovery over a variety of communications protocols. It is geared towards ubiquitous Semantic Web computing, lightweight devices with variable network connectivity, and highly reactive, event-driven interfaces to Semantic Web services.
