# Introduction
##Version 0.0.0.1

Nowadays it is possible to embed RDF in Turtle [1], however it is not easy to see if there is RDF in a page. Inspired by Crowbar [2], I created a tool that displays the triples available in Turtle format. Just copy the link available at http://graves.cl/turtle-in-html/ to your bookmarks and click on it whenever you are in a page with turtle embedded. 
turtle-in-html uses Masahide Kanzaki's excellent Turtle parser [3] and is licenses under LGPL.

# Installation and use

Simply go to http://graves.cl/turtle-in-html/ and add the link in your bookrmark. Later, in a page containing turtle (such as http://graves.cl/turtle-in-html/), you can click on that bookmark and you'll see the triples.
# Known bugs

Currently it only works in Firefox and Chrome and hasn't been tested in other browsers. Feel free to report any bugs.
