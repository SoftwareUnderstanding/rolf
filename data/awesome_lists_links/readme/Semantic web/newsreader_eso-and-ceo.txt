Event and Implied Situation Ontology (ESO) and the Circumstantial Event Ontology for Calamities (CEO)
========================

This repository contains the Event and Implied Situation Ontology (ESO), developed in Newsreader (www.newsreader-project.eu) and the Circumstantial Event Ontology for Calamities (CEO).


ESO_version2.owl is the stable version of the ontology; the ontology itself is described in ESO_documentation. The folder manual-mappings comprises several files with manually mappings from ESO to FrameNet, SUMO and WordNet.

Further, this repository contains the CEO ontology, which builds upon the metamodel of ESO. CEO is designed for the calamity domain (murders, earthquakes, floodings, evacuations, etc) and allows to infer chains of events based on shared event properties. Current version is version 1.0. 

From May 2018 onwards, this repository is further maintained and updated here: https://github.com/RoxaneSegers/CEO-Ontology and here https://github.com/RoxaneSegers/ESO-Ontology.
