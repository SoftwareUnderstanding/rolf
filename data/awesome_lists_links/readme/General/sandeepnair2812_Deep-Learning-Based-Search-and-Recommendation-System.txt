2. Notebooks
    - Data Preparation : Download required data to your local machine [https://github.com/meabhishekkumar/strata-conference-ca-2018/blob/master/01_data_preperation.ipynb ]
    - Short Introduction to Embeddings in Tensorflow

### Setting up the Enviornment

You can easily setup the enviornment with all required components ( data and notebooks ) with the help of Docker.

Here are the steps. 

1. Install Docker on your local machine. You will required documentation on Docker website [ https://docs.docker.com/install/ ]

2. Make sure Docker is working fine. If you are not getting any error and able to see the docker 

```sh
$ docker --version
```

3. Download the docker image and create container for the tutorial

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 0.0.0.0:6006:6006 meabhishekkumar/strata-ca-2018
```
