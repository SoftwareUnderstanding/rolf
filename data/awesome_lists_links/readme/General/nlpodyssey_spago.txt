A **Machine Learning** library written in pure Go designed to support relevant neural architectures in **Natural
Language Processing**.

spaGO is self-contained, in that it uses its own lightweight *computational graph* framework for both training and
inference, easy to understand from start to finish.

## Features

### Natural Language Processing

- Memory-efficient Word Embeddings (with [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) keyâ€“value store)
- Character Language Models
- Recurrent Sequence Labeler with CRF on top (
  e.g. [Named Entities Recognition](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/ner))
- Transformer models:
  - [Masked Language Model](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bert#masked-language-model)
  - Next sentence prediction
  - Tokens Classification
  - Text Classification (e.g. Sentiment Analysis)
  - [Question Answering](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bert#question-answering-task)
  - Natural Language Inference (i.e. Textual Entailment)
  - Zero-Shot Text Classification
  - Text Similarity
  - [Machine Translation](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bart#machine-translation)

### Internal Machine Learning Framework

- Automatic differentiation:
    - Define-by-Run (default, just like PyTorch does)
    - Define-and-Run (similar to the static graph of TensorFlow)

- Optimization methods:
    - Gradient descent (Adam, RAdam, RMS-Prop, AdaGrad, SGD)
    - Differential Evolution

- Neural networks:
    - Feed-forward models (Linear, Highway, Convolution, ...)
    - Recurrent models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM...)
    - Attention mechanisms (Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, ...)
    - Recursive auto-encoders

### Additional features

spaGO is compatible with pre-trained state-of-the-art neural models:

- Hugging Face [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) sequence labeler architecture

## Usage

Requirements:

* [Go 1.15](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)

Clone this repo or get the library:

```console
go get -u github.com/nlpodyssey/spago
```

spaGO supports two main use cases, which are explained more in detail in the following.

### CLI mode

Several programs can be leveraged to tour the current NLP capabilities in spaGO. A list of the demos now follows.

* [Hugging Face Importer](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/huggingfaceimporter)
* [Masked Language Model](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bert#masked-language-model)
* [Question Answering](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bert#question-answering-task)
* [Machine Translation](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/bart#machine-translation)
* [Named Entities Recognition](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/main/cmd/ner)

The Docker image can be built like this.

```console
docker build -t spago:main . -f Dockerfile
```

### Library mode

You can access the core functionality of spaGO, i.e. optimizing mathematical expressions by back-propagating gradients
through a computational graph, in your own code by using spaGO in library mode.

At a high level, it comprises four main modules:

1. Matrix
2. Graph
3. Model
4. Optimizer

To get started, look at the implementation of built-in neural models, such as
the [LSTM](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/main/pkg/ml/nn/recurrent/lstm/lstm.go). Don't be afraid, it is
straightforward Go code. The idea is that you could have written spaGO :)

You may find a [Feature Source Tree](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/main/FEATURE_SOURCE_TREE.md) useful for a
quick overview of the library's package organization.

There is also a [repo](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago-examples) with handy examples, such as MNIST classification.

## Current Status

We're not at a v1.0.0 yet, so spaGO is currently work-in-progress.

However, it has been running smoothly for a quite a few months now in a system that analyzes thousands of news items a
day!

Besides, it's pretty easy to get your hands on through, so you might want to use it in your real applications.

Early adopters may make use of it for production use today as long as they understand and accept that spaGO is not fully
tested and that APIs might change.

## Known Limits

Sadly, at the moment, spaGO is not GPU friendly by design.

  of ["TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442).
* [WhatsNew](https://github.com/SpecializedGeneralist/whatsnew/) - A simple tool to collect and process quite a few web
  news from multiple sources.
* [Translator](https://github.com/SpecializedGeneralist/translator) - A simple self-hostable Machine Translation
  service.

## Acknowledgments

spaGO is a personal project that is part of the open-source [NLP Odyssey](https://github.com/nlpodyssey) initiative
initiated by members of the EXOP team. I would therefore like to thank [EXOP GmbH](https://www.exop-group.com/en/) here,
which is providing full support for development by promoting the project and giving it increasing importance.

## Sponsors

We appreciate contributions of all kinds. We especially want to thank spaGO fiscal sponsors who contribute to ongoing
project maintenance.
