### Introduction

![FeatureVis](assets/FeatureVis.png)

In this work, we design a new loss function which merges the merits of both [NormFace](https://github.com/happynear/NormFace) and [SphereFace](https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface). It is much easier to understand and train, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art loss function (SphereFace) by 2-5% on MegaFace.

### Training

**Requirements:** My Caffe version https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows. This version can also be compiled in Linux.

The prototxt file is in `./prototxt`. The batch size is set to 256. If your GPU's memory is not sufficient enough, you may set `iter_size: 2` in `face_solver.prototxt` and `batch_size: 128` in `face_train_test.prototxt`.

The dataset used for training is CASIA-Webface. We removed 59 identities that are duplicated with LFW (17) and MegaFace Set 1 (42). This is why the final inner-product layer's output is `10516`. The list of the duplicated identities can be found in https://github.com/happynear/FaceDatasets.

All other settings are the same with SphereFace. Please refer to the details in [SphereFace's repository](https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface).

PS: If you want to try the margin scheme described in [ArcFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698), you may try to transplant [this
 layer](https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/blob/experiment/src/caffe/layers/label_specific_margin.cu) in the `experiment` branch of my Caffe repository. `LabelSpecificHardMarginForward()` is the kernel function for `cos(theta+m)`.
