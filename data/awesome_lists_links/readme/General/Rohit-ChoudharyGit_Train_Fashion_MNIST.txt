# Train_Fashion_MNIST
This is the way i started learning tensorflow, ENJOY ML!
# Problem Statement : 
We have Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories.We need to train it on 60k images to predict the next 10k images result. 


Starting from the https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/  
Don't just copy paste the code during learning . Instead read about every word that you encounter, that you don't know.This way we explore the field of ML. There are several blogs written so well to enlighten you on those topic.

# For some of the questions that comes in our mind :

  1. what is google colab?
     https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-tensorflow-keras-pytorch.html 
     
  2. what is tensor flow? How to use it? 
     https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/
     
  3. how google colab is using GPUs & the TPU :

      https://medium.com/syncedreview/googles-tpu-chip-goes-public-in-challenge-to-nvidia-s-gpu-78ced56776b5

  4. what is keras ? 
     https://keras.io/
  
  5. What is matplotlib? (ploting graphs useing this library,read more...)
     https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html
     
     Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays.
     Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and 
     designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. 
     It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.
     One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data 
     in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.
     
  6.   What is Adam? Why to use Adam?
       a good explaination on :
            https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/
       
       Research paper : "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization"  
                         https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980
                       
   7. use of xticks : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14uWUakQGskyG3zWZ1AGwZT9Ulyuaw_Nr#scrollTo=i2_yTtIFiZyT&line=4&uniqifier=1
   
   #  CONCLUSION AND PROBLEM LEFT : 
   1. After training we are left with the problem of overfitting in the data . Which surely I will be removing as i learn further.
