## Course structure

This course is code first. The goal is to get you writing deep learning code as soon as possible.

It is taught with the following mantra:

```
Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept
```

This means we write code first then step through the concepts behind it.

If you've got 6-months experience writing Python code and a willingness to learn (most important), you'll be able to do the course.

## Should you do this course?

> Do you have 1+ years experience with deep learning and writing TensorFlow code?

If yes, no you shouldn't, use your skills to build something. 

If no, move onto the next question.

> Have you done at least one beginner machine learning course and would like to learn about deep learning/pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification?

If yes, this course is for you.

If no, go and do a beginner machine learning course and if you decide you want to learn TensorFlow, this page will still be here.

## Prerequisites

> What do I need to know to go through this course?

* **6+ months writing Python code.** Can you write a Python function which accepts and uses parameters? That‚Äôs good enough. If you don‚Äôt know what that means, spend another month or two writing Python code and then come back here.
* **At least one beginner machine learning course.** Are you familiar with the idea of training, validation and test sets? Do you know what supervised learning is? Have you used pandas, NumPy or Matplotlib before? If no to any of these, I‚Äôd going through at least one machine learning course which teaches these first and then coming back. 
* **Comfortable using Google Colab/Jupyter Notebooks.** This course uses Google Colab throughout. If you have never used Google Colab before, it works very similar to Jupyter Notebooks with a few extra features. If you‚Äôre not familiar with Google Colab notebooks, I‚Äôd suggest going through the Introduction to Google Colab notebook.
* **Plug:** The [Zero to Mastery beginner-friendly machine learning course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse) (I also teach this) teaches all of the above (and this course is designed as a follow on).

## üõ† Exercises & üìñ Extra-curriculum

To prevent the course from being 100+ hours (deep learning is a broad field), various external resources for different sections are recommended to puruse under your own discrestion.

You can find solutions to the exercises in [`extras/solutions/`](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/tree/main/extras/solutions), there's a notebook per set of exercises (one for 00, 01, 02... etc). Thank you to [Ashik Shafi](https://github.com/ashikshafi08) for all of the efforts creating these.

### üìñ 00. TensorFlow Fundamentals Extra-curriculum 

* Read through the [list of TensorFlow Python APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/), pick one we haven't gone through in this notebook, reverse engineer it (write out the documentation code for yourself) and figure out what it does.
* Try to create a series of tensor functions to calculate your most recent grocery bill (it's okay if you don't use the names of the items, just the price in numerical form).
  * How would you calculate your grocery bill for the month and for the year using tensors?
* Go through the [TensorFlow 2.x quick start for beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) tutorial (be sure to type out all of the code yourself, even if you don't understand it).
  * Are there any functions we used in here that match what's used in there? Which are the same? Which haven't you seen before?
* Watch the video ["What's a tensor?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw) - a great visual introduction to many of the concepts we've covered in this notebook.

### üõ† 01. Neural network regression with TensorFlow Exercises

1. Create your own regression dataset (or make the one we created in "Create data to view and fit" bigger) and build fit a model to it.
2. Try building a neural network with 4 Dense layers and fitting it to your own regression dataset, how does it perform?
3. Try and improve the results we got on the insurance dataset, some things you might want to try include:
  * Building a larger model (how does one with 4 dense layers go?).
  * Increasing the number of units in each layer.
  * Lookup the documentation of [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) and find out what the first parameter is, what happens if you increase it by 10x?
  * What happens if you train for longer (say 300 epochs instead of 200)? 
4. Import the [Boston pricing dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/boston_housing/load_data) from TensorFlow [`tf.keras.datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets) and model it.

### üìñ 01. Neural network regression with TensorFlow Extra-curriculum

* [MIT introduction deep learning lecture 1](https://youtu.be/njKP3FqW3Sk) - gives a great overview of what's happening behind all of the code we're running.
* Reading: 1-hour of [Chapter 1 of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by Michael Nielson - a great in-depth and hands-on example of the intuition behind neural networks.
* To practice your regression modelling with TensorFlow, I'd also encourage you to look through [Lion Bridge's collection of datasets](https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/) or [Kaggle's datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/data), find a regression dataset which sparks your interest and try to model.

### üõ† 02. Neural network classification with TensorFlow Exercises

1. Play with neural networks in the [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) for 10-minutes. Especially try different values of the learning, what happens when you decrease it? What happens when you increase it?
2. Replicate the model pictured in the [TensorFlow Playground diagram](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.001&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=6,6,6,6,6&seed=0.51287&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false&regularization_hide=true&discretize_hide=true&regularizationRate_hide=true&percTrainData_hide=true&dataset_hide=true&problem_hide=true&noise_hide=true&batchSize_hide=true) below using TensorFlow code. Compile it using the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss and accuracy metric. Once it's compiled check a summary of the model.
![tensorflow playground example neural network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/02-tensorflow-playground-replication-exercise.png)
*Try this network out for yourself on the [TensorFlow Playground website](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=relu&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.001&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=6,6,6,6,6&seed=0.51287&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false&regularization_hide=true&discretize_hide=true&regularizationRate_hide=true&percTrainData_hide=true&dataset_hide=true&problem_hide=true&noise_hide=true&batchSize_hide=true). Hint: there are 5 hidden layers but the output layer isn't pictured, you'll have to decide what the output layer should be based on the input data.*
3. Create a classification dataset using Scikit-Learn's [`make_moons()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html) function, visualize it and then build a model to fit it at over 85% accuracy.
4. Train a model to get 88%+ accuracy on the fashion MNIST test set. Plot a confusion matrix to see the results after.
5. Recreate [TensorFlow's](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/softmax) [softmax activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) in your own code. Make sure it can accept a tensor and return that tensor after having the softmax function applied to it.
6. Create a function (or write code) to visualize multiple image predictions for the fashion MNIST at the same time. Plot at least three different images and their prediciton labels at the same time. Hint: see the [classifcation tutorial in the TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) for ideas.
7. Make a function to show an image of a certain class of the fashion MNIST dataset and make a prediction on it. For example, plot 3 images of the `T-shirt` class with their predictions.

  * If you're training for longer, you probably want to reduce the learning rate as you go... the closer you get to the bottom of the hill, the smaller steps you want to take. Imagine it like finding a coin at the bottom of your couch. In the beginning your arm movements are going to be large and the closer you get, the smaller your movements become.

### üõ† 06. Transfer Learning in TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling-up Exercises

1. Take 3 of your own photos of food and use the trained model to make predictions on them, share your predictions with the other students in Discord and show off your Food Vision model üçîüëÅ.
2. Train a feature-extraction transfer learning model for 10 epochs on the same data and compare its performance versus a model which used feature extraction for 5 epochs and fine-tuning for 5 epochs (like we've used in this notebook). Which method is better?
3. Recreate the first model (the feature extraction model) with [`mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision) turned on. 
  * Does it make the model train faster? 
  * Does it effect the accuracy or performance of our model? 
  * What's the advatanges of using `mixed_precision` training?

### üìñ 06. Transfer Learning in TensorFlow Part 3: Scaling-up Extra-curriculum
* Spend 15-minutes reading up on the [EarlyStopping callback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping). What does it do? How could we use it in our model training?

### üõ† 07. Milestone Project 1: üçîüëÅ Food Vision Big‚Ñ¢ Exercises

**Note:** The chief exercise for Milestone Project 1 is to finish the "TODO" sections in the [Milestone Project 1 Template notebook](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/TEMPLATE_07_food_vision_milestone_project_1.ipynb). After doing so, move onto the following.

1. Use the same evaluation techniques on the large-scale Food Vision model as you did in the previous notebook ([Transfer Learning Part 3: Scaling up](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/06_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_3_scaling_up.ipynb)). More specifically, it would be good to see:
  * A confusion matrix between all of the model's predictions and true labels.
  * A graph showing the f1-scores of each class.
  * A visualization of the model making predictions on various images and comparing the predictions to the ground truth.
    * For example, plot a sample image from the test dataset and have the title of the plot show the prediction, the prediction probability and the ground truth label. 
  * **Note:** To compare predicted labels to test labels, it might be a good idea when loading the test data to set `shuffle=False` (so the ordering of test data is preserved alongside the order of predicted labels).
2. Take 3 of your own photos of food and use the Food Vision model to make predictions on them. How does it go? Share your images/predictions with the other students.
3. Retrain the model (feature extraction and fine-tuning) we trained in this notebook, except this time use [`EfficientNetB4`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB4) as the base model instead of `EfficientNetB0`. Do you notice an improvement in performance? Does it take longer to train? Are there any tradeoffs to consider?
4. Name one important benefit of mixed precision training, how does this benefit take place?

### üìñ 07. Milestone Project 1: üçîüëÅ Food Vision Big‚Ñ¢ Extra-curriculum

* Read up on learning rate scheduling and the [learning rate scheduler callback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler). What is it? And how might it be helpful to this project?
* Read up on TensorFlow data loaders ([improving TensorFlow data loading performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance)). Is there anything we've missed? What methods you keep in mind whenever loading data in TensorFlow? Hint: check the summary at the bottom of the page for a gret round up of ideas.
* Read up on the documentation for [TensorFlow mixed precision training](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision). What are the important things to keep in mind when using mixed precision training?

### üõ† 08. Introduction to NLP (Natural Language Processing) in TensorFlow Exercises
1. Rebuild, compile and train `model_1`, `model_2` and `model_5` using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) instead of the Functional API.
2. Retrain the baseline model with 10% of the training data. How does perform compared to the Universal Sentence Encoder model with 10% of the training data?
3. Try fine-tuning the TF Hub Universal Sentence Encoder model by setting `training=True` when instantiating it as a Keras layer.

```
# We can use this encoding layer in place of our text_vectorizer and embedding layer
sentence_encoder_layer = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4",
                                        input_shape=[],
                                        dtype=tf.string,
                                        trainable=True) # turn training on to fine-tune the TensorFlow Hub model
```
4. Retrain the best model you've got so far on the whole training set (no validation split). Then use this trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and format the predictions into the same format as the `sample_submission.csv` file from Kaggle (see the Files tab in Colab for what the `sample_submission.csv` file looks like). Once you've done this, [make a submission to the Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data), how did your model perform?
5. Combine the ensemble predictions using the majority vote (mode), how does this perform compare to averaging the prediction probabilities of each model?
6. Make a confusion matrix with the best performing model's predictions on the validation set and the validation ground truth labels.

### üìñ 08. Introduction to NLP (Natural Language Processing) in TensorFlow Extra-curriculum
To practice what you've learned, a good idea would be to spend an hour on 3 of the following (3-hours total, you could through them all if you want) and then write a blog post about what you've learned.

* For an overview of the different problems within NLP and how to solve them read through: 
  * [A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32)
  * [How to solve 90% of NLP problems: a step-by-step guide](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e)
* Go through [MIT's Recurrent Neural Networks lecture](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU). This will be one of the greatest additions to what's happening behind the RNN model's you've been building.
* Read through the [word embeddings page on the TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings). Embeddings are such a large part of NLP. We've covered them throughout this notebook but extra practice would be well worth it. A good exercise would be to write out all the code in the guide in a new notebook. 
* For more on RNN's in TensorFlow, read and reproduce [the TensorFlow RNN guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn). We've covered many of the concepts in this guide, but it's worth writing the code again for yourself.
* Text data doesn't always come in a nice package like the data we've downloaded. So if you're after more on preparing different text sources for being with your TensorFlow deep learning models, it's worth checking out the following:
  * [TensorFlow text loading tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/text).
  * [Reading text files with Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/) by Real Python.
* This notebook has focused on writing NLP code. For a mathematically rich overview of how NLP with Deep Learning happens, read [Standford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning lecture notes Part 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf).  
  * For an even deeper dive, you could even do the whole [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) course. 
* Great blog posts to read:
  * Andrei Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) dives into generating Shakespeare text with RNNs.
  * [Text Classification with NLP: Tf-Idf vs Word2Vec vs BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-nlp-tf-idf-vs-word2vec-vs-bert-41ff868d1794) by Mauro Di Pietro. An overview of different techniques for turning text into numbers and then classifying it.
  * [What are word embeddings?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) by Machine Learning Mastery.
* Other topics worth looking into:
  * [Attention mechanisms](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/). These are a foundational component of the transformer architecture and also often add improvments to deep NLP models.
  * [Transformer architectures](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). This model architecture has recently taken the NLP world by storm, achieving state of the art on many benchmarks. However, it does take a little more processing to get off the ground, the [HuggingFace Models (formerly HuggingFace Transformers) library](https://huggingface.co/models/) is probably your best quick start.

### üõ† 09. Milestone Project 2: SkimLit üìÑüî• Exercises

1. Train `model_5` on all of the data in the training dataset for as many epochs until it stops improving. Since this might take a while, you might want to use:
  * [`tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint) to save the model's best weights only.
  * [`tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping) to stop the model from training once the validation loss has stopped improving for ~3 epochs.
2. Checkout the [Keras guide on using pretrained GloVe embeddings](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/pretrained_word_embeddings/). Can you get this working with one of our models?
  * Hint: You'll want to incorporate it with a custom token [Embedding](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding) layer.
  * It's up to you whether or not you fine-tune the GloVe embeddings or leave them frozen.
3. Try replacing the TensorFlow Hub Universal Sentence Encoder pretrained  embedding for the [TensorFlow Hub BERT PubMed expert](https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/pubmed/2) (a language model pretrained on PubMed texts) pretrained embedding. Does this effect results?
  * Note: Using the BERT PubMed expert pretrained embedding requires an extra preprocessing step for sequences (as detailed in the [TensorFlow Hub guide](https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/pubmed/2)).
  * Does the BERT model beat the results mentioned in this paper? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071.pdf 
4. What happens if you were to merge our `line_number` and `total_lines` features for each sequence? For example, created a `X_of_Y` feature instead? Does this effect model performance?
  * Another example: `line_number=1` and `total_lines=11` turns into `line_of_X=1_of_11`.
5. Write a function (or series of functions) to take a sample abstract string, preprocess it (in the same way our model has been trained), make a prediction on each sequence in the abstract and return the abstract in the format:
  * `PREDICTED_LABEL`: `SEQUENCE`
  * `PREDICTED_LABEL`: `SEQUENCE`
  * `PREDICTED_LABEL`: `SEQUENCE`
  * `PREDICTED_LABEL`: `SEQUENCE`
  * ...
    * You can find your own unstrcutured RCT abstract from PubMed or try this one from: [*Baclofen promotes alcohol abstinence in alcohol dependent cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22244707/).

### üìñ 09. Milestone Project 2: SkimLit üìÑüî• Extra-curriculum

* For more on working with text/spaCy, see [spaCy's advanced NLP course](https://course.spacy.io/en/). If you're going to be working on production-level NLP problems, you'll probably end up using spaCy.
* For another look at how to approach a text classification problem like the one we've just gone through, I'd suggest going through [Google's Machine Learning Course for text classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification). 
* Since our dataset has imbalanced classes (as with many real-world datasets), so it might be worth looking into the [TensorFlow guide for different methods to training a model with imbalanced classes](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data).

---

### üõ† 10. Time series fundamentals and Milestone Project 3: BitPredict üí∞üìà Exercises

1. Does scaling the data help for univariate/multivariate data? (e.g. getting all of the values between 0 & 1) 
  * Try doing this for a univariate model (e.g. `model_1`) and a multivariate model (e.g. `model_6`) and see if it effects model training or evaluation results.
2. Get the most up to date data on Bitcoin, train a model & see how it goes (our data goes up to May 18 2021).
  * You can download the Bitcoin historical data for free from [coindesk.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) and clicking "Export Data" -> "CSV".
3. For most of our models we used `WINDOW_SIZE=7`, but is there a better window size?
  * Setup a series of experiments to find whether or not there's a better window size.
  * For example, you might train 10 different models with `HORIZON=1` but with window sizes ranging from 2-12.
4. Create a windowed dataset just like the ones we used for `model_1` using [`tf.keras.preprocessing.timeseries_dataset_from_array()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array) and retrain `model_1` using the recreated dataset.
5. For our multivariate modelling experiment, we added the Bitcoin block reward size as an extra feature to make our time series multivariate. 
  * Are there any other features you think you could add? 
  * If so, try it out, how do these affect the model?
6. Make prediction intervals for future forecasts. To do so, one way would be to train an ensemble model on all of the data, make future forecasts with it and calculate the prediction intervals of the ensemble just like we did for `model_8`.
7. For future predictions, try to make a prediction, retrain a model on the predictions, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction (retrain a model each time a new prediction is made). Plot the results, how do they look compared to the future predictions where a model wasn't retrained for every forecast (`model_9`)?
8. Throughout this notebook, we've only tried algorithms we've handcrafted ourselves. But it's worth seeing how a purpose built forecasting algorithm goes. 
  * Try out one of the extra algorithms listed in the modelling experiments part such as:
    * [Facebook's Kats library](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats) - there are many models in here, remember the machine learning practioner's motto: experiment, experiment, experiment.
    * [LinkedIn's Greykite library](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite)

### üìñ 10. Time series fundamentals and Milestone Project 3: BitPredict üí∞üìà Extra-curriculum

We've only really scratched the surface with time series forecasting and time series modelling in general. But the good news is, you've got plenty of hands-on coding experience with it already.

If you'd like to dig deeper in to the world of time series, I'd recommend the following:

* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) is an outstanding online textbook which discusses at length many of the most important concepts in time series forecasting. I'd especially recommend reading at least Chapter 1 in full.
  * I'd definitely recommend at least checking out chapter 1 as well as the chapter on forecasting accuracy measures.
* üé• [Introduction to machine learning and time series](https://youtu.be/wqQKFu41FIw) by Markus Loning goes through different time series problems and how to approach them. It focuses on using the `sktime` library (Scikit-Learn for time series), though the principles are applicable elsewhere.
* [*Why you should care about the Nate Silver vs. Nassim Taleb Twitter war*](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-care-about-the-nate-silver-vs-nassim-taleb-twitter-war-a581dce1f5fc) by Isaac Faber is an outstanding discussion insight into the role of uncertainty in the example of election prediction.
* [TensorFlow time series tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series) - A tutorial on using TensorFlow to forecast weather time series data with TensorFlow.
* üìï [*The Black Swan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb - Nassim Taleb was a pit trader (a trader who trades on their own behalf) for 25 years, this book compiles many of the lessons he learned from first-hand experience. It changed my whole perspective on our ability to predict. 
* [*3 facts about time series forecasting that surprise experienced machine learning practitioners*](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-facts-about-time-series-forecasting-that-surprise-experienced-machine-learning-practitioners-69c18ee89387) by Skander Hannachi, Ph.D - time series data is different to other kinds of data, if you've worked on other kinds of machine learning problems before, getting into time series might require some adjustments, Hannachi outlines 3 of the most common.
* üé• World-class lectures by 
Jordan Kern, watching these will take you from 0 to 1 with time series problems: 
  * [Time Series Analysis](https://youtu.be/Prpu_U5tKkE) - how to analyse time series data.
  * [Time Series Modelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3XH7fTHMb4) - different techniques for modelling time series data (many of which aren't deep learning).

### üõ† 11. Passing the TensorFlow Developer Certification Exercises

**Preparing your brain**
1. Read through the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate Candidate Handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf).
2. Go through the Skills checklist section of the TensorFlow Developer Certification Candidate Handbook and create a notebook which covers all of the skills required, write code for each of these (this notebook can be used as a point of reference during the exam).

![mapping the TensorFlow Developer handbook to code in a notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/11-map-the-skills-checklist-to-a-notebook.png)
*Example of mapping the Skills checklist section of the TensorFlow Developer Certification Candidate handbook to a notebook.*

**Prearing your computer**
1. Go through the [PyCharm quick start](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/learning-center/) tutorials to make sure you're familiar with PyCharm (the exam uses PyCharm, you can download the free version).
2. Read through and follow the suggested steps in the [setting up for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf).
3. After going through (2), go into PyCharm and make sure you can train a model in TensorFlow. The model and dataset in the example `image_classification_test.py` [script on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/image_classification_test.py) should be enough. If you can train and save the model in under 5-10 minutes, your computer will be powerful enough to train the models in the exam.
    - Make sure you've got experience running models locally in PyCharm before taking the exam. Google Colab (what we used through the course) is a little different to PyCharm.

![before taking the TensorFlow Developer certification exam, make sure you can run TensorFlow code in PyCharm on your local machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/11-getting-example-script-to-run-in-pycharm.png)
*Before taking the exam make sure you can run TensorFlow code on your local machine in PyCharm. If the [example `image_class_test.py` script](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/image_classification_test.py) can run completely in under 5-10 minutes on your local machine, your local machine can handle the exam (if not, you can use Google Colab to train, save and download models to submit for the exam).*

### üìñ 11. Passing the TensorFlow Developer Certification Extra-curriculum

If you'd like some extra materials to go through to further your skills with TensorFlow and deep learning in general or to prepare more for the exam, I'd highly recommend the following:

* üìÑ **Read:** [How I got TensorFlow Developer Certified (and how you can too)](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-i-got-tensorflow-developer-certified/)
* üé• **Watch:** [How I passed the TensorFlow Developer Certification exam (and how you can too)](https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk)
* Go through the [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization on Coursera](https://dbourke.link/tfinpractice)
* Read through the second half of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow 2nd Edition](https://amzn.to/3aYexF2)

## What this course is missing

Deep learning is a broad topic. So this course doesn't cover it all. 

Here are some of the main topics you might want to look into next:

* Transformers (the neural network architecture taking the NLP world by storm)
* Multi-modal models (models which use more than one data source such as text & images)
* Reinforcement learning
* Unsupervised learning

## Extensions (possible places to go after the course)

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen - If the Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course is top down, this book is bottom up. A fantastic resource to sandwich your knowledge.
