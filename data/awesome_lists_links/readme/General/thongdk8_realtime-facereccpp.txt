# Real-time face recognition with mtcnn, kcf tracker and arcface (insightface)

This is an inference implementation of real time face recogtion, wholely written in C++ with TVM inference runtine. Using mtcnn for facedetection, kcf tracker and insightface model.

### Requirements

* OpenCV 3.4+
* Boost FileSystem (1.58+) 
* CMake 3.2+
* Clang 6.0+
* TVM runtime

#### You can folowing [this doc file](install_requirements.md) or [official doc](https://docs.tvm.ai/install/from_source.html#) to install TVM runtime


### Build with flowing command
Change two line cmake config in [facerecogtion model](facerecognition/CMakeLists.txt) to your TVM source that you downloaded:
- set (DMLC_INCLUDE "/home/thongpb/works/tvm/3rdparty/dmlc-core/include")
- set (DLPACK_INC "/home/thongpb/works/tvm/3rdparty/dlpack/include")

Compile:

    cd realtime-facereccpp
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j4

### Sample command
You can modify parameters in [params.xml](data/params.xml)

    ./facerecognition/facerecognition ../data/params.xml
