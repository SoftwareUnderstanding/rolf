# Super Resolution
This is a basic implementation of a convolutional neural network. Thanks to the writers of the [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network. arXiv 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)[1]. This implementation is for educational purposes only.

# Installation
PyTorch and tqdm is required for this project. Installation for conda environment can be found [here](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/pytorch) and [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tqdm).
