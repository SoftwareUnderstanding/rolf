* *Course description:* 	In this project-based course, students are going to work on a natural language processing challenge. A challenge is a practical task in NLP related to a particular research topic. The task usually comes with data-sets for training, as well as a precise evaluation metric. The intention is that students familiarize themselves with a selected research topic, implement a solution and present the outcome critically in a term paper. The course is a mix of lectures, exercises and project-based work. The focus of this class is on deep learning (neural networks) for NLP.
* *Learning outcomes:* After completing this course, students are able to tackle a challenge in Natural Language Processing, implement a solution, and critically assess their solution in the light of recent research papers in Natural Language Processing.
