This is a web applicationüåê which could help easily diagnose diseases in plants
üå± using Machine Learning all on the web, powered by TensorFlow JS. 

***You can use and test the latest web app from below üëá***

[![Launch Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-example-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-chrome)](http://www.plant-ai.tech/)

## About üîÆ

- Creates a TensorFlow Model for identifying plant diseases
- Creates optimized TensorFlow JS Models
- Uses TensorFlow JS to perform inferences on-device
- Creates a fully functional web app using React
- Exposes a hosted API built with TensorFlow Serving for inferences from the TensorFlow Model

## About the Notebooks

### [`plant-diseases-training.ipynb`](notebooks/plant-diseases-training.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/blob/main/notebooks/plant-diseases-training.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2Fplant-diseases-training.ipynb)

This notebook contains the code to train a model on the [PlantVillage dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08060)
to identify diseases from plant images. Here we provide a subset of our 
experiments on working with this data. Finally we export our model as a 
TensorFlow `SavedModel`.

### [`plant_diseases_TFJS.ipynb`](notebooks/plant_diseases_TFJS.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/blob/main/notebooks/plant_diseases_TFJS.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2Fplant_diseases_TFJS.ipynb)

This notebook shows the the process of converting the TensorFlow `SavedModel` we built in the prequel notebook to the TFJS format for the Plant AI model. It 
also shows performing optimizations on this.

### [`plant_diseases_TFLite.ipynb`](notebooks/plant_disease_TFLite.ipynb)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/blob/main/notebooks/plant_disease_TFLite.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2Fplant_diseases_TFLite.ipynb)

This notebook shows the the process of converting the TensorFlow `SavedModel` we built in the prequel notebook to the TF Lite format for the Plant AI model.

## Run Locally

To get up and running with this web-app, run the following commands, make sure 
you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. This runs the app in 
development mode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI # or clone your own fork
cd Greenathon-Plant-AI
npm install
npm start
```

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) :rocket:.

## Lint ‚úÖ
