## PixFace pix2pix

A small implementation of pix2pix tensorflow by affinelayer (https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow), prepared for client-side use in the browser. Pix2pix is a Conditional Adversarial Network, that creates an output image from an input image.

This generator produces realistic faces from doodles and was trained with over 200 individual images. 
The model was trained in python and exported for use in tensorflowjs. 

Try out the generator here: https://alliballibaba.github.io/PixFace/.

## How to export your model for use in javascript

Once you've finished training your model using affinelayer's **pixpix.py** script, you can use the **export** mode to export only the generator to a new folder:

```
python pix2pix.py --mode export --output_dir exported_model --input_dir your_model --checkpoint your_model
```

To create a .pict file and quantize your model, use the **export-checkpoint.py** script

```
python tools/export-checkpoint.py --checkpoint exported_model --output_file model.pict
```

The default setting for number of filters in the first convolutional layer of your generator (--ngf) and your discriminator (--ndf) is set to 64. When using these settings, the quantized model will be around 50 MB in size and require significant processing power.

For simple use in javascript I recommend setting -ngf to 32 or 16 before training, which will result in a final model size of around 13 MB and 3 MB. This will significantly increase the generator's speed, but also reduce the quality of the generated image.
