# _A Kingâ€™s Ransom for Encryption_: Ransomware Classification using AugmentedOne-Shot Learning and Bayesian Approximation

Requires an NVIDIA GPU, Python 3, [CUDA CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [PyTorch 1.2](http://pytorch.org), and [OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org).
<br>
Other libraries such as [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) are also optionally used in the code. If you wish to use visdom to plot curves and display results, this needs to be set in the arguments via `--display`.

## Method:

_"Newly emerging variants of ransomware pose an ever-growing threat to computer systems governing every aspect of modern life through the handling and analysis of big data. While various recent security-based approaches have focused on detecting and classifying ransomware at the network or system level, easy-to-use post-infection ransomware classification for the lay user has not been attempted before. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of classifying the ransomware a system is infected with simply based on a screenshot of the splash screen or the ransom note captured using a consumer camera commonly found in any modern mobile device. To train and evaluate our system, we create a sample dataset of the splash screens of 50 well-known ransomware variants. In our dataset, only a single training image is available per ransomware. Instead of creating a large training dataset of ransomware screenshots, we simulate screenshot capture conditions via carefully designed data augmentation techniques, enabling simple and efficient one-shot learning. Moreover, using model uncertainty obtained via Bayesian approximation, we ensure special input cases such as unrelated non-ransomware images and previously-unseen ransomware variants are correctly identified for special handling and not mis-classified. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our work, with accuracy levels of up to 93.6% for ransomware classification."_

## Instructions to train the model:

* First and foremost, this repository needs to be cloned:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/atapour/ransomware-classification.git
$ cd ransomware-classification
```

* The second step would be to download the dataset used for the training and evaluation of the model. 
* The script entitled "download_data.sh" will download the data and automatically checks the downloaded file integrity using MD5 checksum. In order to download the dataset, run the following commands:

```
$ chmod +x ./download_data.sh
$ ./download_data.sh
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example of the data used to train and evaluate the approach

* The training code can utilizes [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) to display training results and plots, in order to do which simply run `visdom` and then navigate to the URL http://localhost:8097. If you intend to use this, the argument `--display` needs to be added to the command line.

* To train the model, run the following command:

```
$ python train.py <experiment_name> --data_root=./dataset/train --aug rotate contrast brightness occlusion regularblur defocusblur motionblur perspective gray colorjitter noise --input_size=256 --arch=inception
```

* All the arguments for the training are passed from the file `train_arguments.py`. Refer to that file for further information.

## Instructions to test the model:

* In order to easily test the model, we provide the pre-trained network weights in `pretrained_weights/densenet201.pth`, used to produce high accuracy classification results on the test set.

* To test the approach based on a [densenet201](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) architecture, pre-trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) and the full augmentation protocol, run the following command:

```
$ python test.py --pos_root=./dataset/test --test_checkpoint_path=./pretrained_weights/densenet201.pth --input_size=256 --pretrained --arch=densenet201

```
---

* To test the uncertainty estimation capabilities of the approach employing Monte Carlo drop-out, use the script in `uncertainty.py`.

```
$ python uncertainty.py --pos_root=./dataset/test --neg_root=./dataset/negative --test_checkpoint_path=path/to/checkpoint --input_size=128 --arch=AmirNet_DO

```
