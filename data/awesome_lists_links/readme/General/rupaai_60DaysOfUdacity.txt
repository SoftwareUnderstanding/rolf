- Attended the meetup for PyTorch Summer Hackathon with @cibaca @Halwai Aftab Hasan @Hitoishi Das@Shivam Raisharma

**Thoughts:**
-  I really really want to thank two of my friends @Stark and @Ashish Shrivastava for helping me to go on with this challenge...if it wasn't for you, I might not even complete this course! Hahah :smile:
- Thanks @K.S. for the constant encouragement and support that you provided through working on APTOS Blindness Detection project...It would be really tough starting office if you didn't support
