## Paper summary

### TL;DR

CharacterBERT is a variant of [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) that produces **word-level contextual representations** by attending to the characters of each input token. To achieve that, instead of relying on a matrix of pre-defined wordpieces, it uses a [CharacterCNN](link-to-charcnn) module similar to [ELMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) to produce representations for arbitrary tokens. Besides this difference, CharacterBERT's architecture is identical BERT's.

The figure above shows the way context-independent representations are built in BERT and CharacterBERT. Here, we suppose that "Apple" is an unknown token and see that BERT splits it into two wordpieces "Ap" and "##ple" before embedding each unit. On the other hand, CharacterBERT receives the token "Apple" as is then attends to its characters to produce a single token embedding.

## Motivations

CharacterBERT has two main motivations:

- In more and more cases, the original BERT is adapted to new domains (e.g. medical domain) by re-training it on specialized corpora. In these cases, the original (general domain) wordpiece vocabulary is kept despite the model being actually used on a different domain, which seemed suboptimal (see _Section 2_ of the paper). A naive solution would be to train a new BERT from scratch with a specialized wordpiece vocabulary, but training a single BERT is costly let alone training one for each and every domain of interest.

- BERT uses a wordpiece system as a good compromise between the specificity of tokens and generality of characters. However, working with subwords is not very convenient in practice (Should we average the representations to get the original token embedding for word similarity tasks ? Should we only use the first wordpiece of each token in sequence labelling tasks ? ...)

Inspired by ELMo, we use a CharacterCNN module and manage to get a variant of BERT that produces word-level contextual representations and can be re-adapted on any domain without needing to worry about the suitability of any wordpieces. Moreover, attending to the characters of input tokens also allows us to achieve superior robustness to noise (see _Section 5.5_ of the paper).

## How do I use CharacterBERT?

### Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment that is specific to using CharacterBERT.

If you do not already have `conda` installed, you can install Miniconda from [this link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) (~450Mb). Then, check that conda is up to date:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

And create a fresh conda environment (~220Mb):

```bash
conda create python=3.8 --name=character-bert
```

If not already activated, activate the new conda environment using:

```bash
conda activate character-bert
```

Then install the following packages (~3Gb):

```bash
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
pip install transformers==3.3.1 scikit-learn==0.23.2
```

> Note 1: If you will not be running experiments on a GPU, install pyTorch via this command instead `conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch`

> Note 2: If you just want to be able to load pre-trained CharacterBERT weigths, you do not have to install `scikit-learn` which is only used for computing Precision, Recall, F1 metrics during evaluation.

### Pre-trained models

You can use the `download.py` script to download any of the models below:

> <sup>1, 2</sup> <small>We pre-train BERT models as well so that we can fairly compare each CharacterBERT model to it's BERT counterpart. Our BERT models use the same architecture and vocabulary as `bert-base-uncased`.</small><br>

For example, to download the medical version of CharacterBERT you can run:

```bash
python download.py --model='medical_character_bert'
```

Or you can download all models by running:

```bash
python download.py --model='all'
```

### Using CharacterBERT in practice

CharacterBERT's architecture is almost identical to BERT, so you can easilly adapt any code that uses the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

#### Example 1: getting word embeddings from CharacterBERT

```python
"""Basic example: getting word embeddings from CharacterBERT"""
from transformers import BertTokenizer
from modeling.character_bert import CharacterBertModel
from utils.character_cnn import CharacterIndexer

# Example text
x = "Hello World!"

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    './pretrained-models/bert-base-uncased/')
x = tokenizer.basic_tokenizer.tokenize(x)

# Add [CLS] and [SEP]
x = ['[CLS]', *x, '[SEP]']

# Convert token sequence into character indices
indexer = CharacterIndexer()
batch = [x]  # This is a batch with a single token sequence x
batch_ids = indexer.as_padded_tensor(batch)

# Load some pre-trained CharacterBERT
model = CharacterBertModel.from_pretrained(
    './pretrained-models/medical_character_bert/')

# Feed batch to CharacterBERT & get the embeddings
embeddings_for_batch, _ = model(batch_ids)
embeddings_for_x = embeddings_for_batch[0]
print('These are the embeddings produces by CharacterBERT (last transformer layer)')
for token, embedding in zip(x, embeddings_for_x):
    print(token, embedding)
```

#### Example 2: using CharacterBERT for binary classification 

```python
""" Basic example: using CharacterBERT for binary classification """
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertConfig
from modeling.character_bert import CharacterBertModel

#### LOADING BERT FOR CLASSIFICATION ####

config = BertConfig.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)  # binary classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification(config=config)

model.bert.embeddings.word_embeddings  # wordpiece embeddings
>>> Embedding(30522, 768, padding_idx=0)

#### REPLACING BERT WITH CHARACTER_BERT ####

character_bert_model = CharacterBertModel.from_pretrained(
    './pretrained-models/medical_character_bert/')
model.bert = character_bert_model

model.bert.embeddings.word_embeddings  # wordpieces are replaced with a CharacterCNN
>>> CharacterCNN(
        (char_conv_0): Conv1d(16, 32, kernel_size=(1,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_1): Conv1d(16, 32, kernel_size=(2,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_2): Conv1d(16, 64, kernel_size=(3,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_3): Conv1d(16, 128, kernel_size=(4,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_4): Conv1d(16, 256, kernel_size=(5,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_5): Conv1d(16, 512, kernel_size=(6,), stride=(1,))
        (char_conv_6): Conv1d(16, 1024, kernel_size=(7,), stride=(1,))
        (_highways): Highway(
        (_layers): ModuleList(
            (0): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=4096, bias=True)
            (1): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=4096, bias=True)
        )
        )
        (_projection): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=768, bias=True)
    )

#### PREPARING RAW TEXT ####

from transformers import BertTokenizer
from utils.character_cnn import CharacterIndexer

text = "CharacterBERT attends to each token's characters"
bert_tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenized_text = bert_tokenizer.basic_tokenizer.tokenize(text) # this is NOT wordpiece tokenization

tokenized_text
>>> ['characterbert', 'attends', 'to', 'each', 'token', "'", 's', 'characters']

indexer = CharacterIndexer()  # This converts each token into a list of character indices
input_tensor = indexer.as_padded_tensor([tokenized_text])  # we build a batch of only one sequence
input_tensor.shape
>>> torch.Size([1, 8, 50])  # (batch_size, sequence_length, character_embedding_dim)

#### USING CHARACTER_BERT FOR INFERENCE ####

output = model(input_tensor)[0]
>>> tensor([[-0.3378, -0.2772]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)  # class logits
```

For more complete (but still illustrative) examples you can refer to the `run_experiments.sh` script which runs a few Classification/SequenceLabelling experiments using BERT/CharacterBERT.

```bash
bash run_experiments.sh
```

You can adapt the `run_experiments.sh` script to try out any available model. You should also be able to add real classification and sequence labelling tasks by adapting the `data.py` script.

## Running experiments on GPUs

In order to use GPUs you will need to make sure the PyTorch version that is in your conda environment matches your machine's configuration. To do that, you may want to run a few tests.

Let's assume you want to use the GPU n°0 on your machine. Then set:

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

And run these commands to check whether pytorch can detect your GPU:

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return `True`
```

If the last command returns `False`, then there is probably a mismatch between the installed PyTorch version and your machine's configuration. To fix that, run `nvidia-smi` in your terminal and check your driver version:

<center><img src="img/nvidiasmi.png" alt="drawing" width="550"/></center>

Then compare this version with the numbers given in the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html):

<center><img src="img/cudaversions.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

In this example the shown version is `390.116` which corresponds to `CUDA 9.0`. This means that the appropriate command for installing PyTorch is:

```bash
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch
```

Now, everything should work fine!

    abstract = "Due to the compelling improvements brought by BERT, many recent representation models adopted the Transformer architecture as their main building block, consequently inheriting the wordpiece tokenization system despite it not being intrinsically linked to the notion of Transformers. While this system is thought to achieve a good balance between the flexibility of characters and the efficiency of full words, using predefined wordpiece vocabularies from the general domain is not always suitable, especially when building models for specialized domains (e.g., the medical domain). Moreover, adopting a wordpiece tokenization shifts the focus from the word level to the subword level, making the models conceptually more complex and arguably less convenient in practice. For these reasons, we propose CharacterBERT, a new variant of BERT that drops the wordpiece system altogether and uses a Character-CNN module instead to represent entire words by consulting their characters. We show that this new model improves the performance of BERT on a variety of medical domain tasks while at the same time producing robust, word-level, and open-vocabulary representations.",
