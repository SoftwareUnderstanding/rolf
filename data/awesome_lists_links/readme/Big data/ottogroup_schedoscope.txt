## Introduction

Schedoscope is a scheduling framework for painfree agile development, testing, (re)loading, and monitoring of your datahub, datalake, or whatever you choose to call your Hadoop data warehouse these days.

Schedoscope makes the headache go away you are certainly going to get when having to frequently rollout and retroactively apply changes to computation logic and data structures in your datahub with traditional ETL job schedulers such as Oozie.

With Schedoscope,
* you never have to create DDL and schema migration scripts;
* you do not have to manually determine which data must be deleted and recomputed in face of retroactive changes to logic or data structures;
* you specify Hive table structures (called "views"), partitioning schemes, storage formats, dependent views, as well as transformation logic in a concise Scala DSL;
* you have a wide range of options for expressing data transformations - from file operations and MapReduce jobs to Pig scripts, Hive queries, Spark jobs, and Oozie workflows;
* you benefit from Scala's static type system and your IDE's code completion to make less typos that hit you late during deployment or runtime;
* you can easily write unit tests for your transformation logic in [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and run them quickly right out of your IDE;
* you schedule jobs by expressing the views you need - Schedoscope takes care that all required dependencies - and only those-  are computed as well;
* you can easily  export view data in parallel to external systems such as Redis caches, JDBC, or Kafka topics;
* you have Metascope - a nice metadata management and data lineage tracing tool - at your disposal;
* you achieve a higher utilization of your YARN cluster's resources because job launchers are not YARN applications themselves that consume cluster capacitity. 

## Getting Started

Get a glance at 

- [Schedoscope's features](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Schedoscope-at-a-Glance)

Build it:

     [~]$ git clone https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope.git
     [~]$ cd schedoscope
     [~/schedoscope]$  MAVEN_OPTS='-XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx1G' mvn clean install
     
Follow the Open Street Map tutorial to install and run Schedoscope in a standard Hadoop distribution image:

- [Open Street Map Tutorial](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Open%20Street%20Map%20Tutorial)

Take a look at the View DSL Primer to get more information about the capabilities of the Schedoscope DSL:

## When is Schedoscope not for you?

Schedoscope is based on the following assumptions:
* data are largely relational and meaningfully representable as Hive tables;
* there is enough cluster time and capacity to actually allow for retroactive recomputation of data;
* it is acceptable to compile table structures, dependencies, and transformation logic into what is effectively a project-specific scheduler;
* it is acceptable that your scheduler creates and possibly drops Hive tables and databases it manages.

Should any of those assumptions not hold in your context, you should probably look for a different scheduler.

## Origins

Schedoscope was conceived at the Business Intelligence department of [Otto Group](http://www.ottogroup.com/en/die-otto-group/)

## News

###### 05/08/2018 - Release 0.10.2

We have released Version 0.10.2 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

We have changed the materialization logic of `materializeOnce` views such that they no longer ask their child views to materialize if the `materializeOnce` views have been materialized already. This improves performance.

###### 04/24/2018 - Release 0.10.1

We have released Version 0.10.1 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This is a bugfix release correcting the order of the TBLPROPERTIES and LOCATION clauses in the Hive DDL generated for views. **Please do note that if you use the `tblProperties` clause in some views, this change affects the DDL checksum making Schedoscope drop and recreate the respective tables.** Hence the version bump to 0.10.1.

Thanks to Julian Keppel for reporting the issue and providing the fix.

###### 04/06/2018 - Release 0.9.13

We have released Version 0.9.13 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

Emergency bug fix for Schedoscope crashing upon exports. Do not use 0.9.3!

###### 10/11/2017 - Release 0.9.3

We have released Version 0.9.3 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

Minor bug fix. Show view name in resource manager also for transformations of views that have exportAs statements.

###### 09/21/2017 - Release 0.9.2

We have released Version 0.9.2 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

Minor bug fixes. Improved Metascope performance by optionally circumventing the Hive Metastore API and accessing the Metastore DB directly.

###### 08/17/2017 - Release 0.9.1

We have released Version 0.9.1 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

We fixed a bug in the Spark driver that could lead to incomplete consumption of the error stream of the Spark submit subprocess resulting in transformation freezes.


###### 08/11/2017 - Release 0.9.0

We have released Version 0.9.0 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This release upgrades Spark transformations from Spark version 1.6.0 to Spark version 2.2.0 based on Cloudera's CDH 5.12 Spark 2.2 beta parcel. As a consequence, Schedoscope has been lifted to Scala 2.11 and JDK8 as well. 

This is an incompatible change likely requiring adaptation of Spark jobs, dependencies, and build pipelines of existing Schedoscope projects - hence the incrememtation of the minor release number.

###### 08/04/2017 - Release 0.8.9

We have released Version 0.8.9 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This release contains the following enhancements and changes:
* Cloudera client libraries updated to CDH-5.12.0;
* a [DistCp transformation](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/DistCp-Transformations) for view materialization by parallel, cross-cluser file copying;
* a new [development mode](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Development-Mode) setup that helps developers to easily copy data from a production environment to the direct dependencies of the view they are developing;
* shell transformations had to be moved back into `schedoscope-core` to facilitate development mode;
* a versioning issue with the Scala Maven compiler plugin with regard to Scala 2.10 was fixed so that finally Schedoscope compiles and runs under JDK8 as well.

###### 07/04/2017 - Release 0.8.7

We have released Version 0.8.7 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version contains a critical Metascope bugfix introduced with the last version preventing startup. Also, finally Metascope field lineage documentation has been provided in the [View DSL Primer](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Schedoscope-View-DSL-Primer) and the [Metascope Primer](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Metascope-Primer).

###### 06/23/2017 - Release 0.8.6

We have released Version 0.8.6 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version includes support for field level data lineage - automatically inferred from Hive transformations, declaratively specifyable for other transformations - in Metascope. Also, Metascope lineage graph rendering has been reworked. Extensive documentation to come.

Schedoscope now fails immediately if a driver specified in schedoscope.conf cannot be found on the classpath.

###### 05/26/2017 - Release 0.8.5

We have released Version 0.8.5 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version adds support for float view fields to JDBC exports

###### 05/24/2017 - Release 0.8.4

We have released Version 0.8.4 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version removes a race condition the file system driver initialization that seems to have been introduced with CDH-5.10. Also, we have changed the way how we delete and recreate output folders for Map/Reduce transformations to avoid Hive partitions pointing to temporarily non-existing folders.

###### 04/24/2017 - Release 0.8.3

We have released Version 0.8.3 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version has been built against Cloudera's CDH 5.10.1 client libraries. The test framework no longer artificially sets the storage formats of views under test to text, making testing of Spark jobs writing Parquet files simpler. The robustness of the Schedoscope HTTP service has been improved in face of invalid view parameters.

###### 03/24/2017 - Release 0.8.2

We have released Version 0.8.2 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This version provides significant performance improvements when initializing the scheduling state for a large number of views.

###### 03/18/2017 - Release 0.8.1

We have released Version 0.8.1 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

This fixes a critical bug that could result in applying commands to all views in a table and not just the ones addressed. *Do not use Release 0.8.0*

###### 03/17/2017 - Release 0.8.0


We have released Version 0.8.0 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom).

Schedoscope 0.8.0 includes, among other things:

* significant rework of Schedoscope's actor system that supports testing and uses significantly fewer actors reducing stress for poor Akka;
* support for a lot more [Hive storage formats](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Storage-Formats);
* definition of arbitrary [Hive table properties / SerDes](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Storage-Formats);
* stability, performance, and UI improvements to Metascope;
* the names of views being transformed appear as the job name in the Hadoop resource manager.

Please note that Metascope's database schema has changed with this release, so back up your database before deploying.
