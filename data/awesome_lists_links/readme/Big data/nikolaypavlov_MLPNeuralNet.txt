`MLPNeuralNet` is a fast [multilayer perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) neural network library for iOS and Mac OS X. `MLPNeuralNet` predicts new examples through trained neural networks. It is built on top of Apple's [Accelerate Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/_index.html) using vectored operations and hardware acceleration (if available).

##Why would you use it?
Imagine that you have engineered a prediction model using Matlab (Python or R) and would like to use it in an iOS application. If that's the case, `MLPNeuralNet` is exactly what you need. `MLPNeuralNet` is designed to load and run models in [forward propagation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#Phase_1:_Propagation) mode only.

###Features
- [Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification), [Multi-class classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification) and regression output
- Vectorised implementation
- Works with double precision
- Multiple hidden layers or none (in that case it's same as logistic/linear regression)

##Quick Example
Let's deploy a model for the AND function  ([conjunction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction)) that works as follows: (of course, you do not need to use a neural network for this in the real world)

|X1 |X2 | Y |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Our model has the following weights and network configuration:

![AND Model Example](http://nikolaypavlov.github.io/MLPNeuralNet/images/network-arch.png)

```objective
// Use the designated initialiser to pass the network configuration and weights to the model.
// Note: You do not need to specify the biased units (+1 above) in the configuration.

NSArray *netConfig = @[@2, @1];
double wts[] = {-30, 20, 20};
NSData *weights = [NSData dataWithBytes:wts length:sizeof(wts)];

MLPNeuralNet *model = [[MLPNeuralNet alloc] initWithLayerConfig:netConfig
                                                        weights:weights
                                                     outputMode:MLPClassification];
// Predict output of the model for new sample
double sample[] = {0, 1};
NSData * vector = [NSData dataWithBytes:sample length:sizeof(sample)];
NSMutableData * prediction = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:sizeof(double)];
[model predictByFeatureVector:vector intoPredictionVector:prediction];

double * assessment = (double *)prediction.bytes;
NSLog(@"Model assessment is %f", assessment[0]);
```

##Extended Example
Let's say you trained a net using pybrain or even your own home brewed implementation.

![Extended Example](http://i.imgur.com/v2kMTUH.png)

```objective
// Use the designated initialiser to pass the network configuration and weights to the model.
// Note: You do not need to specify the biased units (+1 above) in the configuration.

NSArray *netConfig = @[@3, @2, @1];
double wts[] = {b1, w1, w2, w3, b2, w4, w5, w6, b3, w7, w8};
NSData *weights = [NSData dataWithBytes:wts length:sizeof(wts)];

MLPNeuralNet *model = [[MLPNeuralNet alloc] initWithLayerConfig:netConfig
                                                        weights:weights
                                                     outputMode:MLPClassification];
model.hiddenActivationFunction = MLPSigmoid;
model.outputActivationFunction = MLPNone;

// Predict output of the model for new sample
double sample[] = {0, 1, 2};
NSData * vector = [NSData dataWithBytes:sample length:sizeof(sample)];
NSMutableData * prediction = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:sizeof(double)];
[model predictByFeatureVector:vector intoPredictionVector:prediction];

double * assessment = (double *)prediction.bytes;
NSLog(@"Model assessment is %f", assessment[0]);
```

##Getting Started
The following instructions describe how to setup and install `MLPNeuralNet` using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). It is written for Xcode 5 and the iOS 7.x(+) SDK. If you are not familiar with CocoaPods, just clone the repository and import `MLPNeuralNet` directly as a subproject.

##Installing through CocoaPods
Please add the following line to your *Podfile*.

```
pod 'MLPNeuralNet', '~> 1.0.0'
```

##Installing through Carthage
Please add the following line to your *Cartfile*.

```
github "nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet" "master"
```

##Import `MLPNeuralNet.h`
Do not forget to add the following line to the top of your model:
```objectivec
#import "MLPNeuralNet.h"
```

##How many weights do I need to initialise network X->Y->Z?
Most of the popular libraries (including `MLPNeuralNet`) implicitly add biased units for each of the layers except the last one. Assuming these additional units, the total number of weights are `(X + 1) * Y + (Y + 1) * Z`.

##Importing weights from other libs.
You can do this for *some* of the neural network packages available.

###R nnet library:
 ```r
#Assuming nnet_model is a trained neural network
nnet_model$wts
```

###Python NeuroLab

```python
#Where net argument is an neurolab.core.Net object
import neurolab as nl
import numpy as np

def getweights(net):
     vec = []
     for layer in net.layers:
         b = layer.np['b']
         w = layer.np['w']
         newvec = np.ravel(np.concatenate((b, np.ravel(w,order='F'))).reshape((layer.ci+1, layer.cn)), order = 'F')
         [vec.append(nv) for nv in newvec]
     return np.array(vec)

```

###Python neon
```python
import numpy as np

def layer_names(params):
    layer_names = params.keys()
    layer_names.remove('epochs_complete')
    # Sort layers by their appearance in the model architecture
    # Since neon appands the index to the layer name we will use it to sort
    layer_names.sort(key=lambda x: int(x.split("_")[-1]))
    return layer_names

def getweights(file_name):
    vec = []
    # Load a stored model file from disk (should have extension prm)
    params = pkl.load(open(file_name, 'r'))
    layers = layer_names(params)
    
    for layer in layers:
        # Make sure our model has biases activated, otherwise add zeros here
        b = params[layer]['biases']
        w = params[layer]['weights']

        newvec = np.ravel(np.hstack((b,w)))
        [vec.append(nv) for nv in newvec]
    return vec

# An example call
getweights(expanduser('~/data/workout-dl/workout-ep100.prm'))
```

###Python keras
```python
import numpy as np

def get_weights_from_keras_model(model):
    vec = np.array([])
    for i in xrange(0, len(model.get_weights()), 2):
        bias = model.get_weights()[i + 1]
        weights_matrix = model.get_weights()[i]

        newvec = np.ravel(np.concatenate((bias.reshape(-1, 1), weights_matrix.T), axis=1))
        vec = np.append(vec, newvec)
    return np.array(vec)

```

## Performance benchmarks
In this test, the neural network has grown layer by layer from a `1 -> 1` configuration to a `200 -> 200 -> 200 -> 1` configuration. At each step, the output is calculated and benchmarked using random input vectorisation and weights. Total number of weights grow from 2 to 80601 accordingly. I understand that the test is quite synthetic, but I hope it illustrates the performance. I will be happy if you can propose a better one! :)
