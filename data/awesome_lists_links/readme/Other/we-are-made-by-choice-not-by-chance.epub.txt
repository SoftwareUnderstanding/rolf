### Preface

We are living in a mysterious universe. The whole universe is mysterious, startling; still beautiful. Philosophy and science both are used to unravel many mysteries in the universe. One question always strike to the mind of philosophers and scientists whether the universe is made by chance or it is a choice of the Supreme Soul! Why does the incorpeal Supreme Soul make this universe and how is it made?

Science is working to discover many natural laws and also become successful to unravel many mysteries. Physics was existed before physicist got birth, chemistry was existed before chemists got birth and also biology was existed before biologists got birth; because the great scientist was there before the creation of this universe.

The whole universe is made in scientific and logical manner. The things we see around us are not made by chance rather it is made for a purpose. It is a choice to make the things to fulfil a purpose. The modern scientific research works to find out that purpose and become successful in many cases. When the science is successful to unravel any mystery the universe seems more mysterious.

In this book I tried to put up my own opinion to proof the act of the Supreme Soul for creation of this magnificent universe. The readers are requested not to use this book for scientific reference. The scientific facts are used for the general purpose to give a flavour for their understanding.

There are many such examples present around us those are startling for the human mind. I have discussed few examples from the nature to establish the logic for the act of the Supreme Soul.

Science needs evidence where as philosophy prove the subject through logical thoughts. Science fills the stomach, keeps the physical body fit and provides comfort and luxury to human life whereas the philosophy helps the human consciousness to develop. For the human beings it is equally important to develop their consciousness as like to live a luxurious life.

This book is focused to glorify the creation of the Supreme Soul so that the human beings could develop an attitude to admire the creation of this universe and adore the Supreme Soul for this creation.

### Chapter-1

###  Introduction

We are living in a mysterious universe. The philosophy and physics both the subjects predict many aspects about the existence of the universe. The human mind is running behind to unravel the mystery of the making of the universe. This running is like running behind a mirage. The modern men try to find out solutions to the doubts by scientific experiment. As the scientists could be able to unravel one mystery, they could find more mysterious things in the universe. Though the modern man is running behind the mysteries and trying to find out the solutions in scientific way still they could not deny the act of Godhood for the creation of the universe. From today onwards the scientists have to go a long way to accept the act of Godhood for the creation of the universe. It may be too early for them to stop their proof. The modern man is working to find out the evidence of existence of Godhood through their scientific experiments and observations.

The scientists are running before the evidences to accept the act of Godhood for creation of the universe whereas the philosophers put their logical thoughts and strongly prove that the existence of the universe is the act of Godhood. The philosophers put their credit for the divinity for the existence of the universe and also for every happening in the universe.

Through the discussion in this book I would like to express my thoughts about this matter through small examples those are happening in and around us. To describe this subject I would take help of the established facts and figures from both science and philosophy. Let us first discuss the physics of the creation of the universe.

Before creation of the universe there was absolute nothing. Except nothing there was nothing. That means there was singular nothing. In singular nothing an explosion took place. Who did this explosion? Why did this explosion happen? What are the materials used in this explosion? These mysteries are still to be proved by scientific methods. From the scientific evidences the age of that explosion is estimated to be ~ 13.78 billion years from 2013. The time just after the explosion estimated to be 10-12 s was very much crucial. This was the period during which the basic elements for mater were produced. The mater was in plasma state that is the fourth state of mater. The space was hot, dark and ionized. The mater stayed for 10-12 s in this state.

At the age of 1second, the universe was so cold that the protons and neutrons are formed from quarks. Within next few minutes the nuclei of light elements like hydrogen, helium and lithium were formed through Big Bang nucleosynthesis process. During this period elements up to Boron could be formed. The formation of heavier elements than boron could not be formed because of the rapid cooling process of the environment. The space was so cool that at this stage the elements higher than boron could not be formed. Out of these five elements hydrogen and helium are gas where as lithium, beryllium and boron are solid. So lithium as the first solid metal was formed within few minutes after the Big Bang explosion.

After creation of hydrogen and helium, it had taken 4 billion years to create stars. From scientific evidences, it said that the Sun is made of hydrogen and helium. The energy generated in Sun is due to the fusion of hydrogen and helium.

During these 4 billion years the universe expanded from the point of Big Bang explosion. Due to the expansion of the universe, some regions of the space were dense with hydrogen. As millions of years passed the slight difference grew large, as dense area was created that attracts materials due to gravity and thus the stars were formed.

The existence of the Sun in our solar system was quite necessary.

Do you imagine our earth as it is today without the Sun?

Yes, it is required. It is must for the present way of live. Without Sun we might have to live in full darkness or life may not be possible.

Before creation of life in this world the sunlight and energy were created.

Here I would like to discuss about the nucleosynthesis that had taken place during few minutes after Big Bang explosion. Within few minutes of the explosion; hydrogen, helium and lithium were generated. If this process would have continued in the course of time, all the heavier elements than boron might have produced. If this had happened we would not see the universe as it is today. All the celestial objects might have built by the heavier elements rather than hydrogen and helium.

The Sun in our solar system might not have made of hydrogen and helium. If not, than it would not be able to produce light and energy.

So I would predict that the process of formation of stars from light elements and fundamental elements like neutron was planned process. If it was not a planned process then the process of formation of elements heavier than boron would have taken place continuously.

The process of formation of heavier elements than boron was stopped to form stars. It took one billion years to form galaxies. In galaxy there are many solar systems like ours. The solar system in a galaxy follows a particular pattern. Many galaxies form a milk way.

As our solar system consists of the Sun, nine planets and their sub planets, there are many such solar systems in a galaxy. Many galaxies together form one milk way.

It took 10 billion years to form our solar system. It might have taken both the processes like bottom up and top down from Big Bang explosion to the life today we have in this earth.

First the explosion was happened. How the explosion was happened it is still a mystery. No doubt without any physical elements how an explosion would happen?

The human being might not be able to do any explosion without any physical element?

Bottom up is that process in which small elements congregate to make big element. But the top down process is the reveres, where big element generates small elements.

During 10-12 s of the explosion fundamental particles like electrons, protons, neutrons were generated. During first few minute hydrogen, helium and lithium were generated. This is a bottom up process where electron and proton congregate to form neutral particles like hydrogen, helium, lithium etc. During one billion years from the explosion primordial hydrogen and helium congregate to form the milk way and galaxy. Than about ten billion years the galaxies gave birth to solar system. This is a top down process. The solar system was generated from galaxy.

After ten billion years life started in our earth. That life was in the form of single cell.

In between 40 millions of years and the start of the single cell living entities in our earth there was a period in which the universe was cooled enough to create basic elements; metallic and non metallic elements in the universe. During that time the elements we find in the periodic table could have formed.

From the appearance of the single celled micro organism living entities to the human civilization in this earth it took around 4 billion years. The life on earth has involved the biochemical evolution of this single celled micro organism. The fossil of the single celled micro organisms, bacteria, archea could be found in rocks of 3.4 billion years old. The fossil of multi celled living entities those are found are younger than one billion years.

How did a non living molecule converted to a living one that mystery is not known to the mankind!

How did an organic molecule achieve such a complexity to be a living single cell micro organism?

Living entities in this earth are made off from some of the abundant elements in this universe. Those basic elements are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorous. About 30 different molecules produced out of these basic elements are the building blocks of the living entities.

Is it possible for any human being, a scientist or a biologist to make a living cell out of these elements?

There are many theories put up by many philosophers from Aristotle in ancient Greece to the modern scientists of the 21st century. From fossil findings of the single celled micro-organism to the nanobes which was found in 1990s the mystery could not be unravelled. The mystery stays as mystery.

It is still to be known how a non living complex molecule was converted to living entities!

The single celled micro organism was created by chance in a suitable environment or was created by choice?

To which the human being should believe?

If it was created by chance then a day will come when the human being could be able to decode that situation and could be able to create life on its own. If it was created by choice then it is beyond the subject of the human being. This choice may be of the nature, the Supreme Soul!

The scientific observations are far away to predict the exact condition in which the non living complex organic molecule could have converted to the living single celled micro organism.

According to Bhagavad consciousness, the Supreme Soul created the universe from singular nothing, created stars, planets and the basic elements as building blocks of this stars and planets. After creation of the basic elements the Supreme Soul had instilled His consciousness in each and every element that we see in this universe.

If we observe a living creature at just before its death and just after death, the difference is the consciousness. From where this consciousness come from and after death where does it go? How does it go out of the body?

Is it the consciousness that differentiate the living entities from its non living organic compound? Yes it is. Even the single celled bacteria have own consciousness.

Is the consciousness going out of the living body and going in to create the living entity by choice or is it happening by chance?

If it is by chance then it may not be true for all the unaccountable living entities. It is happening with all the living entities. So there must be a plan, there must be a choice for this action.

This choice is of whom? Is it of the Supreme Consciousness? In many religious literatures it is mentioned about the size less, incorpeal characteristic of the Supreme consciousness.

According to a scientific observation in recent decades, it was predicted that the whole universe is consisting of 4.9% of atoms, the building block of stars and planets. Dark matter contributes up to 26.8% of the universe where as the rest 68.3% of the universe is comprised of dark energy. This ratio was found out from the total mass-energy relationship of the known universe.

There is no proper definition of dark matter and dark energy. These are two hypothecated terms to be solved by the mankind; to be proved by the scientific community through proper evidence. Otherwise these mysterious energy and matter will always be mysterious throughout the age of this universe.

From the Big Bang explosion at a single point in the singular nothing the universe has expanded to 93 billion light years. One light year is ~ 9.4 x 1012 km. Still the universe is expanding.

This expansion of the universe is due to the dark energy present in the universe. From where does this energy come from? As we know that the conversion of the mass gives rise to energy – from where this mass comes from? This mass is assumed to be the dark matter. These matters appear and disappear in the space. Due to the appearance and disappearance the mass converts to energy.

What is this mass? How is this mass? These are still mystery to know. There are many experiments going on throughout the developed nations to detect the dark matter. The presence of the dark matter may be on the surface of the earth, below the surface of earth or in the space.

If the human being could be able to detect and identify the dark matter, that would help the human being to unravel the mystery of the dark energy.

The entire subject discussed above though scientific in nature, I have tried to give a general touch for the continuation of the subject matter of this book. The mystery behind the making of this universe is still a mystery from scientific prospective. Some maters or facts are reasonable to explain and understand. But many of them are still to explain.

The first incident i.e. the Big Bang explosion – how did it happen and what was the material used for the explosion? It is not possible to create any explosion without any material!

The second incident was to cool the space very rapidly so that the formation of heavier elements than boron could be stopped. This was done because the plan was to create stars first, Sun in our solar system. Without the Sun the life as we live today might not be possible.

If the formation of the heavier elements would have continued within few minutes from the explosion the celestial elements, the stars might have made with heavier elements rather than hydrogen, helium, neutron etc. In such cases the star might not have the power to generate energy.

As the Sun in our solar system generate energy from fusion cycles of hydrogen and helium, the generation of energy might not have possibility if the Sun would have made by heavier elements.

Do not you feel that it was part of the great plan to form the stars first than the heavier elements?

The third incident took place when life came to the organic compound. How did the life come to the organic compound formed from basic elements? The physical body of the living entities is made out of the organic compounds those are formed from hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus.

A single celled micro organism or bacteria without life or consciousness is mere a physical organic compound just made up by any of the above six elements.

So this is a point to explore how did the life come to existence through the single celled micro organism? If it was a chance than the micro organism would not have evolved to mankind. Purely this is part of the great plan.

The Supreme consciousness instilled the consciousness in the single celled micro organism in a suitable environment. The age of the single celled micro organism is estimated to be 4 billion years and that of human being is more than one billion years.

Since the human being evolved from single cell to the human being as it is today, is there any chance that any other creature better than the human being would be created in next few billion years?

As of now the human being is the most intelligent living entity on the earth. Is there any chance for any other creature more intelligent than human being is going to be evolved? Is it the ultimate goal of the nature to create human beings?

Life is consciousness in a physical body. Without consciousness, physical body is a non living entity. The growth of consciousness is also evolved from the single celled micro organism to the human being.

Is it the plan of the Supreme Soul for the evolution of the consciousness?

Since the birth of the human being one billion years back there is a chance for the human consciousness to develop within human being.

Human intellect is intelligent enough to understand many things though not all things of the nature. The human being is able to understand the nature and protect the nature. Any other creatures are not capable to do what a human being could do.

So it is strong perception that the ultimate choice of the Supreme Soul was to make the human being. The human being were created at the last stage may not be the least. The human beings were created at last but with more intelligent.

Human beings are intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the universe, the laws of the nature and intelligent enough to admire the creation of the Supreme Soul and to adore the Supreme Soul.

As the human beings are ultimate creature of this universe, with sufficient intelligent and capability to develop that intellect there may not be any need for creation of any other animal better than the human beings.

But for the human being it is required to develop their intellect.

The human beings are made by choice but not by chance. Anything happens by chance that does not repeat for trillions of times. The thing which happens by chance that happens for once or twice not for trillions of time. Trillions of times are for the making of the human beings. They are made for the same physical form may be with different character. The physical form of the human body is repeatedly made since last one billion years. So it is not by chance.

Then why the human beings are chosen to be made in this universe? What is the purpose behind this creation?

In the following chapters of this book, I would like to discuss some important facts about the nature from which we could be able to conclude the subject line of this book. That is we are made by choice not by chance.

If the nature would have been made by chance it might not have been as it is today. We may not explore the great plan of the nature but could be able to come close to that point. If we closely observe, we could notice that most of the material available in this world is utilized for the human habitation.

Let us discuss many such surprising facts.

### Why Iron Ore is more than Gold in Mines?

Could you imagine a world without iron?

The iron is strong, easy to process, chip and abundant.

If we subtract iron from the human civilization it would be difficult to realize a civilization like that we have today. From sky scraper buildings to rail network everywhere we need iron as a structural material. It is the strongest element of all that we have as per the periodic table.

There is abundance of iron ore throughout the world. The deposits of the iron ore in mines throughout the world are highest among all the solid elements. The production of the ore throughout the world as per 2013 statistics is highest among all other mine products except coal. Let us discuss how the iron element was made.

Within first 3 minutes after the Big Bang explosion, hydrogen and helium were formed. Along with hydrogen and helium within 300 seconds after Big Bang explosion lithium, beryllium and boron are considered to have formed. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling, no elements heavier than boron could be formed. Hydrogen and helium are abundant element in the whole universe where as lithium, beryllium and boron are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also after that in the stars. Further formation of heavier elements could not possible because of the drop in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand.

I have discussed about the point at which the universe stop production of heavier elements. From this point onwards the galaxy formation started with hydrogen and helium. The stars got birth from the galaxy. It is supposed to be 500 million years ago the first star could have born due the collapsing of hydrogen and helium. Since that time the star formation has occurred continuously.

After the star formation occurred by the collapsing of hydrogen and helium, the stars act as thermonuclear furnaces in which hydrogen and helium are fused into heavier nuclei. The element found in earth was created by stellar nucleosynthesis and by supernova nucleosynthesis prior to the formation of the earth. They range from carbon to plutonium. Synthesis of these elements occurred either by nuclear fusion or by nuclear fission followed by beta decay.

The formation of carbon by this method is very important for production of other heavy nuclei. Carbon is produced by triple alpha process in all stars. The carbon is the main element that causes release of free neutrons within the stars giving rise to s-process in which slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier than iron.

A star produces heavier elements by combining lighter elements like hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen and helium act as fuel in the stars. So during this process the stock of hydrogen and helium slowly goes down. A day will come when all the hydrogen and helium stock in the stars will vanish. So the star will vanish. That is why the scientists estimate the life of our Sun to be about 6 billion years. By this time all the hydrogen and helium in the Sun will finish.

So coming to iron formation, this element was formed even before the formation of the earth. The presence of iron shows that not only it could be formed in earth but also in the space. The evidence is from the meteorites those strike the earth; most of them are made of pure iron.

If the iron is strongest element, could be processed easily and economical do you think this is made by chance? Do you think the abundance of iron ore in the earth is by chance? Do you think the economical condition for iron is by chance? Do you think the huge use of the iron throughout the world is by chance?

But what I could realize that this was within the great plan of the Supreme Soul before billions of years back for formation of iron and keeping it abundant. The supreme Soul could have envisaged the use of iron by the human habitation in modern life.

For processing of the iron ore the coal is needed. As like the abundance of iron ore so also coal. Coal is also a top abundant component in the earth. The iron along with the coal shapes the world, make human life comfortable and make the world more beautiful. Most of the countries produce iron ore also produce coal.

This is a natural process for making iron ore and coal more in the nature. Iron is a fundamental element where as coal is a composition of carbon, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen and ash with carbon more than 75%. The iron is made before formation of the earth whereas the coal is made after formation of earth. Coal is made from the green vegetation in the earth. When the green vegetation buried under the earth due to natural calamities, the decomposition of vegetation under high pressure forms coal.

There is another product of carbon is diamond. Diamond is formed when carbon deposits are exposed to high pressure and high temperature for prolonged period of time. Deep within the earth's crust there are regions where it is thermodynamically possible for liquefied carbon to form into diamond.

If all the coal those formed from carbon would have converted to diamond, we might not see the world as it is today. Diamond is of no use rather than jeweller. Though it is a costliest product but it does not have significant application like coal.

All those look bright are of no significant use.

Gold is another metal available in the market but for higher cost than iron. The cost is closed to thousand times than iron. If the primitive man would have power to select the deposits of the metal in the earth or to make the metals, the primitive man might have converted all the iron to gold. The primitive man because of his limited intellect could not have envisaged the use of iron in modern days.

This might not be just a natural process for which heavy deposits of iron, coal and petroleum oil are there throughout the world. Without a vision this is impossible. This vision was not of the natural law. This vision was of the Supreme Soul, the designer of this universe. Since billions of years back the Supreme Soul could have envisaged the use of iron by the modern man for his basic needs. A house, transportation, vehicles, bridges are all the basic needs made by iron; what not. That's why to meet all these basic needs the iron was made available to the human beings. The iron is made to process easily and economical.

Definitely without iron we could not have live our life as it is today. In every walk of life we see the use of iron. The iron is not made by chance but it the choice of the great designer of this universe.

If we notice the elements in the periodic table, all the naturally made fundamental elements are used by the modern man by one way or other. Out of all these elements iron is the most used fundamental element.

This was in the conceptual designing of the universe by Supreme Soul. We can't neglect his vision for making iron the strongest and abundant element.

In the previous chapter I have assumed that no other creature better than human being could be evolved in next few billion years. Making of the human being was the ultimate goal of the Supreme Soul. As the Supreme Soul thought of to make the human being so also He has thought of how to make human life better.

Definitely human life would be more comfortable and healthier with abundance of iron not of gold. Gold as a jewel metal has limited use. It does not have that much strength like iron; the cost is thousand times high. As it is not required for the fulfilment of the basic needs of the human habitation so it is insufficient in the nature.

Even iron is also there in other celestial bodies. There is the evidence through the meteorites those strike the earth. Many of the meteorites are of pure iron. If anybody found any meteorite with gold he definitely becomes happy.

The use of iron not only started in recent centuries. It was started even in the pre-historic age in this earth.

In comparison to iron and gold, gold looks beautiful and attractive where as iron is neither beautiful nor attractive. Gold is of no basic use but iron is used in every walk of life.

So those things look bright that may not be strong enough to sustain any jerk. In human life the strength should be within the mind. The human being to sustain a beautiful life should have strong moral character. It is the inner strength of human being that leads to success in life.

Degree in subjective studies may guide anybody to get a lucrative job but to understand the purpose of life, the purpose of the universe the subjective studies is not enough. To understand our purpose of existence we have to study the spiritual legacy that was created by our ancestors.

We do not make anything without any purpose; so also the Supreme Soul. Without any purpose the Supreme Soul would not have made this universe. Without any purpose the Supreme Soul would not have made the mankind. Without any purpose the Supreme Soul would not have made the iron as it is and deposits in huge quantity.

Everything around us not made by chance. Though we can say these are made by natural laws, then who is making this law and who is governing this law?

When we say a law that means it is made for a systematic and regulative nature. Because of this systematic and regulative nature things are made in the universe. If we see the universe we could find higher order in many places and situations. Keeping things in higher order is a law of the nature.

There are most iron producing countries also produce coal. Do you think this was done by chance? Or the human being is intelligent enough to predict the rule of the higher self for this order?

Definitely there are options with the human being. The human being may or may not choose the rule of the Supreme Soul for making this universe, for the higher order of the material around us. The human being may assume a random natural law that is making this universe. That is the freedom of choice of the human being.

There are many such things which surprise the human mind. The human mind is not intelligent enough to unravel many enigmas in the universe. But due to the logic of the philosophy it is not hard to believe the rule of the Supreme Soul for making such higher order in the universe.

There are many such attractions in the universe for which the human mind is compelled to admire the Godhood. The human being adores the supreme Soul for this magnificent creation.

When the Supreme Soul made such beautiful and enigmatic things for the comfort of human being, then what is wrong in expression of gratitude for the Supreme Soul!

There are many such evidences from which the human mind accepts that we are made by choice not by chance. Once the human being accepts this fact, it would be very much easy for him to understand the purpose of his existence.

### Chapter-3

### Awareness

The nature deposits all of the necessity elements for the human habitation in its lap. There is law of nature to teach the human beings to live better life through proper utilization of the natural resources. In a suitable situation the nature creates awareness in the human mind. The human consciousness catches that awareness generated in the nature. That awareness when understood by the human mind becomes the way of life. Once that awareness suits the life of human being, carries on through thousands of years.

The supreme Soul takes incarnation in the form of human being. Lives life of a common man and teaches the human beings about the glory of the Supreme Soul. In Bhagavad Gita, Bhagaban Shri Krishna stated that if He would not incarnate into the life of human being, He could not teach about proper way of life to the human beings. This is the prescribed duty of the Supreme Soul to teach the mankind for better life. This is in the plan of the designing of the universe. If the Supreme Soul could not teach the human beings for better life then unwanted population would grow throughout the world. This unwanted population would be the cause of destruction of the whole universe. So, the Supreme Soul would be the destroyer of His own creation.

To the knowledge of the human beings there are many such incarnations throughout the ages of the human habitation. The incarnated souls teach the mankind for a better living, for the purpose of their existence, for the purpose of the universe. The incarnated souls teach the human beings about the glory of the Supreme Soul. The incarnated soul creates awareness in human mind through the spiritual teachings, spiritual knowledge. Even the incarnated souls teach the human beings about the secrets of the creation of this universe, creation of the mankind, creation of the material world.

The incarnated souls teach the human beings about the expression of the highest feelings of love, affection, caring, kindness, compassion and its benefits. The incarnated souls teach the human beings to love the human beings. The spiritual legacy was created by the incarnated souls.

Though there may not be scientific evidence for many such facts but those facts are too scientific to believe; those facts are too logical and convincing.

Here I would like to discuss one such fact that I feel could convince your mind about the presence of the Supreme Soul, the creator of this universe and the mankind, through incarnated souls among human beings. The subject I am going to discuss in the following paragraphs is a live example of the presence of the Supreme Soul among the human beings. It is a possibility.

Modern science is based on evidences. Without evidences the modern science may not accept any facts or natural laws. The facts and laws those are proved through evidences are said to be scientific.

During Vedic times there was a sage called Kapila Muni. Sage Kapila was born to Sage Kardama as his father and Devhuti as mother. Sage Kapila was considered as the incarnation of the Supreme Being Vishnu. He was the founder of Sankhya philosophy. Sankhya philosophy teaches for the self realization through acquiring transcendental knowledge. Those human beings desire freedom from the entanglement of unnecessary material desires could adopt the path of self realization.

But here in this chapter I will not focus in detail about the Sankhya philosophy rather I will focus on one teaching rendered by sage Kapila to his mother Devhuti. After birth of Kapila, his father sage Kardama left his home for meditation in jungle. In absence of her beloved husband, Devhuti was bemoaned. To please his mother, Kapila started teaching her about Sankhya philosophy and bhakti yoga (devotional activity). During his teachings, Kapila taught a lesson about the human birth. He narrated all the stages of the growth of foetus in the womb from the day one of the congregation of the sperm and egg. That narration is discussed below.

At the first day of the congregation of the sperm and the egg, fertilization starts. The combination is called zygote in modern science.

After fertilization the zygote starts division of cells and by fifth day it becomes spherical in shape.

By the tenth day the zygote become like a solid ball of cells. This solid ball by the 10th day is called as morula in modern science.

By the first month of fertilization the head starts to grow over the shoulder. Modern science says the development of the spinal cord starts through somites and brain bulge start developing over notochord.

During the second month after fertilization arms and legs have lengthened with distinguishable foot and hand. Heart bulges, develops and begins to beat in a regular rhythm.

During the third month all the essential organs like fingers, nails, skin, bone, heart, circulatory system, digestive system, reproductive system, respiratory system, nervous system, all the senses and genitals have developed. This agrees well with the modern science.

During fourth month essential fluids know as sapta dhatu i.e. seven essential ingredients like body fluids from liver and pancreases, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow of the bones and semen starts producing in the body. This stage of production of essential ingredients of the body agrees with the modern science.

By fifth month the foetus feels hungry and thirsty, gets food from the mother through umbilical cord or naval string.

At the end of sixth month all the organs develops to complete form and foetus takes the shape of a complete human structure. The development of the foetus by this time is well agreement with the modern science.

By the end of seventh month of fertilization the foetus gets consciousness, feels its body motion, feels the darkness inside the womb and feels the discomfort being inside the womb fluid. Start realizing to come out of the womb. This stage of development is well agreement with modern science that says about the development of the nervous system and controlling of some of the body motion.

From end of seventh month to the time of birth the foetus stays in the womb with complete structure, gets food from the mother. The mother's food habit affects the growth of the foetus. After seventh month essential nervous connections with sense organs established completely.

Above example of the teachings of sage Kapila to his mother Devhuti during Vedic times really startling to my mind. The technique that images the development of the foetus in the womb was invented only during 1950s. The technique of ultrasound imaging came to existence during this time and came to full-fledged application in hospitals during 1970s.

Who could narrate each and every stages of the development of the foetus inside the womb even day by day and month by month without any imaging techniques?

Definitely this is possible none other than the creator itself. The creator only knows it.

This is strong evidence about the incarnation of the Supreme Soul in the human body. I don't feel anybody could disagree with this fact. The incarnation of the Supreme Soul is a reality.

This is the plan of the designing of the universe. This is a part of that great plan for creation of mankind and let the mankind know about the creation.

That is why the Supreme Soul takes incarnations even of a common man to teach the human beings about their existence, about their creation; teach the human beings to develop their consciousness for which they get birth to this material world.

The spiritual legacy we have is indispensable. The spiritual legacy was created by the incarnated souls, sages and saints through thousands of years. One could gain knowledge from this legacy and transcend his soul and consciousness.

Knowledge could be gained from the resources we already have. From the knowledge we could be aware of the facts for betterment of our life.

Knowledge creates awareness. Once awareness is generated in human mind definitely he could utilize this for betterment of his life.

There are many such lessons taught by the incarnated souls in past times. Those are very much essential to understand the purpose of our existence. It is needed to know the purpose. It is needed to recognize the unresolved issues in this life. Once a human being could be able to recognize any unresolved issues in his life and work to rectify that issue, definitely that life of the human being would be fruitful.

Due to anxiety for future, career and busy work schedule the modern man is avoiding to gain the knowledge from the spiritual legacy. Though one could not gain immediate results from the effort for the spiritual knowledge but it helps in long run through one's life.

Now a day the man is running behind immediate outcome of his effort. He wants more gain from less effort. That is fine but for the development of consciousness it is required to follow the paths shown by the great souls.

Awareness is generated through lessons for the benefits of highest feelings like love, affection, kindness, compassion, caring etc. It is also told about the misfortune when the bad feelings like hatred, violence, cheating, cruelty, selfishness are expressed. The human being could not distinguish the bad feelings from the good feelings due to the effect of selfishness.

A selfish person could not see beyond his benefits. Either he becomes cruel or cheats someone else that does not matter for him only he could see the benefits he could get out of this job. He might be able to gain from that cruel act and cheating but he would not get remission from the result of the cruel act or cheating. A day would come when he has to suffer for his cruel act.

The human being should be aware of his act and he could realize that his act is not hurting anybody's emotion, life or property. This is an ultimate religion of the mankind; just because of your benefit do not hurt any body's emotion, life or property.

This propensity of the human being could be developed through awareness; awareness to recognize good feelings and bad feelings. Awareness as I told earlier is come from knowledge. A human being gains the knowledge only when he puts his effort, when he desires to gain it.

Purification of propensity in human life is not job of one day. It takes several years to purify a particular propensity in one life. Even one life is not enough to do it.

Due to ignorance, the human beings feel that whatever he is doing is right. Whether that hurts anybody's emotion, life or property, he could not recognize that due to the darkness of ignorance that covers his intellect. There may not be any supervisor for his job but there is law of nature to counter his misdeeds. He might be able to gain short term goal but in long run when the law of nature starts its action, he must have to suffer according to his misdeeds.

A person invites his misfortune by his misdeeds.

All the misfortunes those come in human life may not be due to his misdeeds. Sometimes the misfortune come in human life to make him stronger, provide an opportunity to purify his propensity, provide an opportunity for development of his consciousness.

The person who is well aware of the situations and have knowledge could withstand against any misfortune. The awareness and the knowledge about the reality of the human life could lead that person to convert the misfortune to most fortunate event in his life.

The reality of the human life is for expression of highest feelings with other human beings. There is good price for highest feelings; that pays off one day. Through action, knowledge and awareness the human beings get opportunity to develop his intellect, to develop his consciousness.

A developed intellect could not hurt anybody's emotion, life or property for his own benefits. But a mediocre intellect would not hesitate to do this for his benefits; because the limit of the mediocre intellect does not allow thinking beyond his benefits. This is due to the ignorance of the mediocre intellect.

The darkness of ignorance could be brightened through awareness.

There are many examples and lessons taught by various incarnated souls, sages and saints to the mankind through thousands of years. Those teachings are with us in the form of spiritual and religious scriptures, texts, Puranas, Vedas and Upanishads etc. It is up to the individual human being how he could develop the desire to know about the reality of human life.

Every human being has two types of jobs. One job is for the growth and sustaining of the physical body and the other is for the growth of the intellect and consciousness. The requirement for the growth of the physical body is material while the requirement for the growth of the consciousness is awareness. The physical body is with you for this life but the consciousness is with you forever; beyond life.

So your duty to fulfil the material needs in your life is definitely important; at the same time your duty for the creation of the awareness for development of your consciousness is as important as the material needs.

Spirituality does not limit the human being only to create awareness through acquiring transcendental knowledge. This gives equal opportunity to enjoy this material world. This gives opportunity to human being to fulfil his material needs.

Acquisition of wealth and proper utilization of it is taught in many spiritual books. There are lessons those teaches how to acquire wealth in authenticated way. There are lessons those teach how to seek the blessings of the Supreme Soul for fulfilment of the material needs in human life. It is better to seek the blessings of the Supreme Soul for fulfilment of the material needs rather than fulfilment through cheating other human being and through act of cruelty and violence.

You are made by the choice of the Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul chooses you to enjoy this material world so that you could share the highest feelings with Him, you could admire His glory and you could adore His highness.

You have to learn the way how to seek His blessings. Expression of the highest feelings by the human beings is one of the choices of the Supreme Soul. That is the reason why He makes so many human beings. The Supreme Soul has given freedom to the human beings; what to choose and what not to chose.

This is the choice of the Supreme Soul to take incarnations as human being and teach the human beings for betterment of their life. The incarnations do not happen by chance. The awareness created by the lessons taught by the incarnated souls is indispensible for human life. The human being has to desire to generate the awareness in his life through acquisition of knowledge.

A beautiful, charming barllet bird does not sit on perished goods or dead bodies rather that chose green branches of the tree where it could sit and sing songs. Likewise the awareness comes to human being those are free from puzzles, doubts, delusion, bad feelings and most importantly wish to develop their consciousness through transcendental knowledge.

### Information Technology

Twentieth century was said to be the century of information technology. We have seen great changes in our life because of the evolution of information technology. Its application covers every sphere of life like research, industry, processing, entertainment, medical, telecom, meteorology and what not. The evolution of the mobile phone is due to the share of the information technology. The instrument which takes the information technology to a great height even beyond the imagination of the human being is a digital computer.

In 1930s Alan Turing pioneered the work of the digital computer. Since that time the life of human being changed a lot with the evolution of the computational speed and size.

Digital computers work by using algorithms, which are step by step procedure for calculations. Such algorithms are implemented by logic circuits. The logic circuit generates voltage differences usually being data in the form of bits. A bit is a single numeric value either 1 or 0 that encodes a single unit of digital information. 8 bits in a sequence form a byte. The size of computational storage devices go up to Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes etc.

A logic circuit is a simple gate with one or two inputs and one output. The inputs or the outputs can be either on or off. The value of the circuit's output is completely determined by the value of its input. When the input is changed it takes some time for the output to change in response. This time determines the speed of the computer. Each gate does a simple computation. Complex computational circuit can be built by connecting output of some gates to inputs of other. The entire computer is built in this way.

The computer does not apply its own logic. The logic circuit of a computer is programmable. Whatever input we give, according to the programme the computer gives the output. The logic circuits can be programmed in many different ways. A logic circuit programmed for digital photography would not work for scientific calculations and vice versa. A logic circuit programmed for mobile technology would not work for any other applications. So a logic circuit is like a slave. First store the programme in it and then ask to do the same job repeatedly for infinite times. That logic circuit once programmed work for ever unless the programme is changed.

So information technology is like a relationship of a master and a slave. Whatever programme the master does on the logic circuit in the computer, it obeys forever. That is why the computer and information technology is most favourites among human beings; because it obeys the order.

Though the computer and thus the modern day information technology starts from 1930s, the information technology exists since the birth of the whole universe. In the above paragraphs I have discussed a general view of the computer and the information technology to give a flavour about the subject. In this chapter I will try to discuss some of the aspects of the information technology that exists throughout the ages of this whole universe for billions of years.

This way I would like to establish the fact that the whole universe is made by choice of the Supreme Soul but it is not by chance. The choice of the Supreme Soul is programmed in each and every element that we see around us. If it would be by chance the things would have changed.

A rose plant that produces red rose keeps on producing red roses for ever. Though there are different types of colour of the roses a particular rose plant produces only one colour. The seeds collected from a particular colour plant produce the same colour again. Unless the gene of the seeds is modified, the seeds produce same output for ever.

A seed when supplied with trace elements through soil, water, air and sunlight grows to a plant and then produces rose. This is a process going on for thousands of years.

It is an impossible task of the human beings to raise a plant from a rose seed if they are supplied with trace elements, water, air and sunlight.

The gene of the rose seed is like a computer programme. The gene was programmed and that programme runs exactly the same way for millions of years.

The information stored in the gene of the rose seed is followed by the seed. When the seed gets trace elements, water, air and sunlight that automatically grows from a sprout to a plant and then produces rose. The cycle goes on. The rose then produces seeds.

We have not seen any apple tree producing oranges! The apple tree produces apple only and an orange tree produces orange. This process goes on.

Who might have done this programming?

Do you feel automatically this highest order of the nature is maintained?

Definitely for this highest order of the nature, there must be a master. The master asks the logic circuit to perform according to its programming.

A rose plant does not produce china rose (hibiscus) or jasmine and vice versa. A rose plant does not become a creeper, its leafs does not become that of jasmine plant.

A tree of a mangrove forest is hard to find in a desert land. The trees those need more water, moisture for its growth could not grow without water in a desert land. The gene of the mangrove forest tree is made like that only. The gene is made for huge amount of water.

The trees those grow in desert land die when get huge amount of water. Some tree die due to lack of water and some die due to heavy water. There is an instruction through the gene of the trees where to grow and how to grow.

This process is not random. There is an order for it.

Plants and trees have many benefits for the human habitations. Human gets his stomach filled from the green vegetation, makes shelter, use it for many different uses most importantly gets medicine from plants and trees.

There are many medicinal plants and trees. Leafs, flowers, fruits, seeds, roots even barks are used for medicinal purposes. Modern system of medicine is only few centuries old whereas the human habitation is millions of years old. In ancient times the human beings were dependent on the plants and trees for medicines even this trend goes on today. A particular plant gives a particular medicinal value. A plant used for a particular disease may not use for other diseases. This is possible because of the programming of the gene of the plants for a particular purpose.

Without any purpose nothing is made. The human being has to find that purpose. The virtue of the information stored in the genes of the plants and the trees never change even after millions of years. Rose produces rose, apple produces apple, orange produces orange, and jasmine produces jasmine and so on.

Tea plants can't grow everywhere. If it would be the case the human being could have earned lot of money. There is a difference in productivity of different lands. A heavy rain region produces particular crops than scars rain region. The vegetation that grows in scars rain region would not be productive in heavy rain region. That is the reason why different region people have different food habit.

The choice of the food habit is not manmade. Rather that depends upon the environment. As there is a contrast of the geographical conditions throughout the world; so as the food habit. The food habit of a particular region depends on the productivity of the land of that region. The productivity of that region depends upon the environmental conditions.

As the environmental condition is a natural phenomenon the designer has designed it such a way that the human habitation would not be deprived of the food. So there are many different crops, vegetations, fruits etc. could be grown in different regions.

This is possible due to the information stored is each crops, plants and tree genes. The information technology was there before the human habitation. First the information technology was generated then the evolution of the human being started.

In recent times scientists are trying to increase the productivity, resistive power to draught and insecticides of some of the crops and vegetables. This is possible because they are modifying the genes of these products. These are known as genetically modified seeds. The scientists re-programme the genes of these seeds.

Unless it is done externally the genes do not modify self. Once re-programming done by the scientists the virtue of the seeds changed according to the new programme. That virtue carries on through future times.

As like green vegetations in the whole world, the same thing happens with the animals. The properties like physical, moral, emotional, resistive power for the environment are programmed differently in each and every living species in this world. The animals do their part according to programming in their genes.

We could see many different species those exist in this world they live differently for different purposes. There are living entities those are considered as useless by the human beings, could contribute significantly for establishing equilibrium of the environment; some type of bacteria is such example.

The polar bear which inhabit in extreme cold condition could walk on snow floor, could live the entire life in snow and cold conditions. The gene of the polar bear is stored with the information that could suit the extreme cold condition.

Unlike polar bear a camel is made to live in extreme hot conditions. The camel could walk on desert sand, could withstand desert sand storm and even could live without water for many days.

Is it possible to exchange the environment or the habitation for camel and polar bear?

Neither of them could survive in the opposite conditions. The polar bear could withstand extreme cold condition whereas the camel could withstand the extreme hot condition.

This is possible because of the programming of their respective genes.

The food habit of different animals is different. Some of them are carnivorous, some of them are herbivorous and some of them are mixture of both. The carnivorous animals do not change their habit, so also the herbivorous animals. Even if they are extremely hungry, they do not change their habit.

Is it due to limitation of their intellect?

Definitely this is due to the information provided to their genes that decides their food habit. A dear never eat animals whereas a lion never eats vegetation.

The physical structure and colour of the body of the animals is decided by the genes. Tiger cub looks like tiger, an infant elephant looks like elephant, an infant zebra looks like zebra always through infinite time. The strips of a zebra do not change from generation to generation. The colour of the tiger does not change to green.

Have you seen any green tiger?

Each and every animal carries the same physical properties since their evolution millions of years ago.

Innocence and aggressiveness are instilled differently in the genes of different animals. A dear can't be as aggressive as a tiger. Whatever the properties are instilled in the genes of the animals they could not over perform that information. They follow the programming exactly.

The tusk of the elephant and the high neck of the zebra do the same job respectively. The tusk of the elephant is used for collection of food and the neck of the zebra is used for the collection of the food too. Though these two different physical structures of two different animals do the same job, not even a single time throughout the history the elephant born with a high neck and a zebra born with a tusk!

Though the purpose is same the structure designed for elephant and zebra carry on from generations to generations. The information could not be re-programmed by itself even neither by the elephant nor by the zebra.

Elephant and zebra are big animals. If we discuss about small creatures like fish, we could not see any distortion of activities by them from their designing. Let us take example of sea fish and sweet water fish. If we exchange them, put the see fish in sweet water for long time and sweet water fish in sea water; do you feel they could survive?

Definitely they could not survive for long time. The environmental condition is programmed for each and every creature of this universe. Information like body structure, body colour environmental condition, propensity, food habit is instilled in the genes of every animal. The wild animals could not re-programme their genes; whatever programme is there just they have to follow it.

Among all the creatures in this world, the human beings are very special. They are superior to any other creature due to the superiority of their intellect. The intellect of the human beings and the freewill to develop the intellect distinguish the human beings from any other creatures.

The physical, moral, intellectual value with a person gets birth is programmed in his genes. The genes of the human beings is written in the 48 chromosomes out of which 24 come from father and 24 come from mother.

The genes decide all most all the factors of the human life like growth of physical body, history of its generation, resistive power to diseases, resistive power to face the adverse conditions, memory, free will, ego etc,.

The information stored in the genes of human beings if decoded and written in papers, it would produce more than 15 lacs of pages. All these information are stored in a micrometer size cell.

As per the above discussions about all the living creatures like plants and animals there is a distinction for the human beings. Any other living entities do not have the power or capability to re-programme their genes, whereas human beings are blessed with capability to re-programme their genes up to some extent.

Though the human beings could not re-programme the genes for physical aspects of their life like physical structure but they have the power to re-programme their genes for better propensity. They could increase the resistive power to the adverse situations in life.

Highest feelings like love, affection, caring, kindness and compassion could be grown in human mind through habit and conscious effort. The genes of the human beings could be re-programmed through nature and nurture. The propensities of the human beings have the tendency to change, have the tendency to be re-programmed through development of the intellect and the development of the consciousness.

The human beings are blessed with most important factor like freewill. They have the freedom of choice to re-programme their genes. This is one of the important purposes why the human beings are created in this universe. The important purpose is to re-programme their genes so that they could feel the highest feelings among human beings as well as with the Supreme Soul.

The human beings have the freewill to choose their own way of life. The divinity does not interfere with the freewill of the human beings. Whatever the human beings choose they get it. It may good or bad.

It is up to the human being to recognize which factor of his gene requires re-programming. The propensities which create havoc with own self that needs re-programming. The propensity which hurts own self as well as that of other human beings needs re-programming.

The purification of the propensities needs lots of effort. The human beings has to gain the transcendental knowledge to be capable to recognize the own propensity which requires re-programming for better feelings. This is not one day job. This may take many years even many life times for reprogramming the genes of the human beings for better propensities.

Are you ready for it?

### Our Thought Our Life

It is very difficult to predict the evolution of any better creature than human beings in next billion years. The living creatures from single celled micro organism evolved through last ~ 4 billion years. It took this much of time because each step was followed by natural law, scientific way and logical meaning. The process of evolution is well understood. If human beings were made by chance they would have inhabitated since last 4 billion years. Unfortunately the human beings evolved since last one billion years.

As the process of evolution of living entities was scientific and logical, the human beings could be able to decode the underlying mechanism of the evolution. At this point of time it is hard to say about the evolution of any creature better than human beings.

At present the human beings are better creatures in this whole world. The intellect and consciousness distinguish the human beings from any other creatures.

Through the living entities the Supreme Soul, the creator tried to establish a most important secret if His creation i.e. the evolution of the consciousness. Though there is evolution of the physical body of the living entities through billions of years, that we could see through many evidences, but the latent secret is that the living entities are made for the evolution of the consciousness.

The physical body is a medium for the evolution of the consciousness where as the evolution of the consciousness is the ultimate goal of this creation.

As the human beings could satisfy this condition i.e. to support the evolution of the consciousness there may not be any need for the evolution of any other creature better than the human beings.

The human beings are able to understand the natural laws, are able to recognize the act of the Supreme Soul for this magnificent creation of the material world as well as the mankind. The most importantly the human beings are able to share the highest feelings with the Supreme Soul.

Then what else is required from the human beings by the Supreme Soul?

Why the human beings should worry that there will be any better creature in this world in next one billion years?

I don't think that any other better creature would be evolved in next billion years and that could rule the mankind.

The human beings inherited those qualities which are required by the Supreme Soul. The human being has the potential to develop his intellect and to develop his consciousness.

This is the ultimate goal of this creation for the development of consciousness. The human beings have the potential to achieve this goal. To achieve this, the human beings are blessed with freewill. They are not forced to develop either their consciousness or their intellect.

There is a natural thing even we could see within the human beings; when anybody is forced to do anything then optimum output may not be received from him. When he is allowed to execute his freewill and he is told about the benefits of his effort, definitely he would perform in a better way.

The same thing is applied for the human beings by the Supreme Soul by providing the freewill to the human beings.

Anybody is not forced to develop his intellect or consciousness. Anybody is not forced to admire the creation of the Supreme Soul. Anybody is not forced to adore the Supreme Soul.

But instead of a forceful demand from the human beings for the development of the consciousness, the Supreme Soul provided with the freewill to the human beings and deposits each and every necessity for their habitation in this world.

There is abundance of the material necessity for the development of the physical body as well as the awareness for the development of the consciousness.

When the human beings are getting each and every necessity fulfilled from the nature then what is wrong in doing the job according to the natural law! The natural law guides the human beings for development of their intellect and consciousness.

Unfortunately many of the human beings are misguided by the unreal world. They go away from the reality and run before an unreal world and waste their time and effort.

It may be difficult to accept the reality but once it is accepted by any individual then definitely he is going to glare in his life.

There is a thumb rule for the development of the consciousness. That is do not hurt anybody's emotion, life or property for shake of own benefit or ego.

The persons those who follow this rule definitely develop an intellect which always tend to share highest feelings among human beings. When a person makes up his mind that he would not hurt anybody's emotion, life or property slowly and steadily the seeds of highest feelings like love, affection, caring, kindness, compassion grow in his mind.

A day would come in his life when these seeds of highest feelings grow to sprouts, plants and then gives the fruits. When the person savours the taste of these fruits he would get enlightment in his life.

It is possible. It is a reality. It is the ultimate goal of every human being to savour the fruit of enlightment.

In the human body there is subconscious mind. It has unlimited potential. The subconscious mind is designed for the human beings to achieve the ultimate goal. We can't see where exactly it is in the human body but it is there. We could feel it. We could realize its action. We could utilize it for betterment of our life. That is a great thing.

There is a proverb "as we sow so we reap". This proverb becomes true through the subconscious mind. The way in which anybody programmes his subconscious mind that way he could lead his life.

As anyone energies his subconscious mind for the thumb rule that is not to hurt anybody's emotion, life or property, the subconscious mind is steadily programmed for the execution of the highest feelings. The mind becomes calm and quite. The mind becomes steady. The mind becomes powerful to handle any scattered situations in life.

The principles in our life guide us through a better path. The human beings have to follow the set of principles. Following rules and regulations set by parent institutions like your family, school, college, university or employer guides you steadily to a regulated life. Many people take pleasure out of disobeying the principles. That is their freedom of choice.

A regulated life guides the subconscious mind. When it is required in any situation the subconscious mind executes the result of this regulated life through action.

For a long term goal i.e. for the development of the consciousness the regulated life has a high impact. That purifies anybody's thought. A purified thought guides the person for better action. In the course of time the regulated life becomes the way of life. Steadily that way gets printed in subconscious mind.

In our society, people talk of any person that they don't believe to doubt a person who behaved in a proper manner through his life would do any big mistakes. It becomes very hard for the people to accept any misdeed of a great person.

The regulated life and purified thoughts not only help the consciousness to develop but also that creates a big impact on the surrounding people as a residue.

If we observe anybody's life one could predict the condition of his subconscious mind. Our action, reaction, expression are the reflection of our subconscious mind.

What we think regularly in the way of life that gets reflected in our action, reaction to any situation and expression through words.

The existence of the subconscious mind with the human beings is not by chance rather it is the choice of the Supreme Soul to empower the human being to execute his freewill.

It is a designed factor for the human life. The way in which the human being executes his freewill that develops a thought process in his mind and this regulated thought got instilled in the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind brings either fortune or misfortune according to the thought.

The subconscious mind works in both directions. Whether it is bad or good for you, the subconscious mind does not distinguish. This only works according to thoughts, according to programming.

A person is responsible for all the happening in his life; good or bad. But the human being has the power to convert his misfortune to most fortunate one. It is required just to reverse the thought. There are many examples in our society where people with infirmities transcend to great achievements. People those we think unfortunate one day they become more fortunate than us.

What might have happened to those successful people those are said to be unfortunate?

Reversing the thought could guide the human beings through a way to achieve great heights. To reverse the thought one has to have the self realization. The self realization could be generated through awareness. And for awareness one has to gain knowledge; the knowledge of the reality of the human life. To gain knowledge one has to execute his freewill, one has to put his effort.

The human beings are blessed with a great factor of freewill. Those who are able to discover the power of the freewill within them, they become more powerful person in this world. Here I would like to clarify the meaning of the power as the power to achieve transcendental love from the Supreme Soul. This power is to create things for human habitation, the power to create opportunity for other human beings to live their life in a better way. The power is to create awareness among human beings about the glory of the divinity.

The power for cheating other human beings, creating unnecessary doubt, delusion, confusion in others mind is not considered as Supreme power. This is negative power which is unwanted still existing among human beings. One has to keep away from this power centre; otherwise no one would be responsible for his misfortune in his life.

Imbibing good thoughts in mind could be happened with anybody. That does not see rich or poor. The thought requires a desire. The person who desire to have better thought for the betterment of his life in a positive way, definitely purified thoughts get imbibed in his mind. When the mind is sprinkled with good thoughts definitely that person is going to perform well in his life.

A same situation looks differently to different people. Some of them see the situation from positive prospective whereas some of them see it in negative way. This perception in any situation is dependent on the way in which the person is regulating his thoughts. The person who is always regulating his thoughts in positive direction would find positive prospective whereas a person who is always regulating his thoughts towards negativity would find negative of that situation.

The person who finds negative of any situations always may fill his mind with sorrow, frustration, distress in his life. He may not be happy with any situation. There are people around us who are too unhappy in their life irrespective of what good things they have. As they energize their mind in negative way always, that reflects in every situation in life.

For happiness and success in life a steady state of the mind is required. The steady state of the mind could be achieved through regulated positive thinking. This is an effort by any individual to be adopted in the way of life. It is not a day's job that the mind would achieve the steady state. This comes through practice.

The human beings are blessed with a power to take advantage of any adverse situations in life. When one road is blocked definitely many roads would be opened up. Those open roads may bring better fortune. You are not here to suffer in this world rather you are here to enjoy your life, to savour the fruit of success. Only thing is that you have to exercise your intellect to find out a suitable way out of many. Opportunities are there. One has to direct his thought towards the positivity of the opportunity.

Miracle does not happen with each and every human being. Rather they could create miracles in their life with their thought and effort.

Before doing anything first the human being thinks about the matter. Then he starts the job. The thought is generated first than action. So human being has the chance to create positive thought so that he could do the job in a positive manner.

In many situations the human being directly thinks about the end result. If the end result is going to be in negative direction than the human being becomes unstable and distress. When the end result is seems to be negative it is better to go forward in a step by step manner. When you think step by step the effect of the end result disappear.

Thinking about future is good but when it gives pain it becomes a curse. Direct your thoughts to achieve immediate goals. You may plan about distance goals but do not bother about it. Be concern about your future, plan for it and work for it. Don't worry about the outcome. Don't allow the worry to capture your mind. Rather engage your mind with positive thoughts. One thing you can keep in your mind that you are here to enjoy not to suffer.

If wealth is lost nothing is lost, if health is lost something is lost but when mind is lost everything is lost.

Human life is all about the mind. There are many great persons those who rose from poverty stricken childhood to the top of the world. There are many great persons those in spite of infirmities achieved great heights in their life. They could do it only because of their thought. They thought to be and they became. They utilized the unlimited potential of their mind.

The unlimited potential is with every human being. This potential is provided by the Supreme Soul through the subconscious mind. This is a choice of the Supreme Soul for the human beings that they should prosper through utilization of the power of the subconscious mind.

The choice of the Supreme Soul is that the human beings should utilize the power of the subconscious mind for experiencing the highest feelings with other human being and with the Supreme Soul.

It is the responsibility of the human beings to recognize the choice of the Supreme Soul and work according to that choice. Still they are free to do this. They could utilize their freedom of choice.

Thoughts shape human life. Positive thoughts could be adopted through practice. It may take many years to set the trend of positive thinking. Once the trend is set then the positive thoughts flow like water in a river. As the water in a river keeps on flowing till not reached to the ocean, the positive thoughts keep on flowing till the human being transcends in his life. You have to set the trend. Then see the result.

### Inventions and Discoveries

Before the evolution of the human being from single celled micro-organism the basic elements, compounds were formed. The natural law was existed. The universe was governed by natural law. The gravity was generated during first few billion of years from the Big Bang explosion. The gravity came into picture when the hydrogen and helium molecules dense up together to form the galaxies. The hydrogen and helium being electrically neutral they were dense up only due to gravity. The gravity plays an important role for the evolution of the universe from the single point explosion.

Requirement is the mother of all inventions. When the human habitation started in this world, the intellect evolved, the human beings started searching for better life. He came to know about fire. Fire represents energy. Fire started from wood. The requirement of fire and energy is fulfilled by many different ways. Initially it was started from wood then the use of coal was invented. Use of wood ran through millions of years where as use of coal are just few centuries old.

After the initiation of the use of coal for fire and energy human beings were able to use oil. There might be use of different oils before use of coal. But the use of petroleum oil came later after the use of coal.

Since few decades from now the human beings started using gas as a source of energy. All these elements like wood, coal, petroleum and gas are limited. According to statistics the coal, petroleum and gas are going to finish within next ~100 years.

Except coal, oil and gas the electrical energy is also generated from hydro projects. According to the increasing demand of electricity only the hydro project would not be sufficient. When the human beings realized the extinction of any source of energy, they start working for the alternative source. This realization gave birth to generate energy by solar energy. According to technology the solar energy alone would not be sufficient to substitute coal, oil and gas.

So the human beings are in a mission to find out the ultimate source of energy which would be unlimited in nature. That is the fusion energy. The energy which we get from the Sun is due to the fusion reaction taking place on the Sun. The same reaction could be done in the earth in the laboratories. Huge scale research projects are going on to harness energy from fusion reactions.

Here I would like to discuss one fact. In physics we know that there are four stages of matter; solid, liquid, gas and plasma. The sequence in which the human being was able to harness energy also follows this sequence. The fire from the wood and the coal is from solid state of matter. This use appeared first. Then the human being was able to harness energy from oil i.e. the liquid state of the matter. At the third stage the human being used gases like LPG, CNG, and PNG etc. Now in recent decades the use of solar energy started throughout the world in the form of solar power stations and also mini and micro instruments. The solar energy is due to the fusion reaction in the sun which is in the plasma state of the matter.

When the human beings would be able to harness energy from the fusion reactions in laboratory scale, it would be one of the biggest inventions in the history of the mankind.

For the human habitation the energy is required the most. Without energy it is very difficult to realize life on this earth. In steps the human being started creating energy from small piece of fire wood and reached to a stage when he is able to harness energy from the solar energy. Definitely a day will come when the human being will be able to get energy from the fusion in the laboratory scale.

For the fusion reaction in the laboratory two isotopes of hydrogen i.e. deuterium and tritium are required and these two isotopes are there abundantly in the nature as unlimited source. So once it is established the scarcity of energy will vanish forever.

When the human beings find shortage of anything that gets fulfilled by any other means. The enigma of nature is unpredictable. But the most enigmatic fact is that the nature always wants to see the joy, comfortable and luxurious life of human beings.

Nature has everything within it. Only the human being has to put the effort. There are many evidences about the effortless inventions of many useful physical processes.

Let us take the example of x-rays. The x-ray is used extensively throughout the world as a medical diagnostic tool within few months of its invention. Even at the time when the scientists were unaware of how it was being generated and the physics of its origin, the x-rays were used in medicals for imaging of the human body. In November 8, 1895 Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was working in his laboratory for some other experiments with cathode ray tube. He was not working to generate x-rays. He was busy doing experiments to determine the nature of cathode ray emission. One screen of barium platinocyanide was kept in his laboratory. During the experiment he found an unexpected glow on the barium platinocyanide screen. When the experiment started in cathode ray tube the screen started glowing. This phenomenon surprised Roentgen. The cathode ray was established during that time that it could not go beyond four inches; whereas the screen was placed more than a foot away.

Then Roentgen concluded the glow was not due to the cathode ray rather it was due to something else. That's why the name was given as x-rays due to its enigmatic nature.

First he saw the presence of x-rays and then he and other scientists started working to find out the origin of x-rays. Since its invention there is no other technique potentially strong enough to replace x-ray imaging techniques in medical diagnostics.

There are many miracles happen throughout the history of the scientific inventions. The awareness generated by the nature to give a gift to the human beings came through miracles. The human mind which is free from puzzles, free from doubts and seek the blessings could be able to catch that awareness of the nature.

The scientists are the agents of the Supreme Soul. They captured the awareness of the nature and transform that awareness to the physical form. They are the angels for creating comfort and luxury of the mankind.

Each and every scientific invention has a purpose for the mankind. Most of the inventions are used for the fulfilling the basic requirements of the human habitation, for providing comfort and luxury to the mankind.

The discovery of penicillin changed the world of medicine enormously. The discovery was said to be fortunate accident. Sir Alexander Fleming was involved in experiments with the influenza virus. He was described as a careless laboratory technician. He went on two week vacation and when he returned from the vacation on September 28, 1928, what he saw in his laboratory that revolutionalized the medicine.

Sir Alexander Fleming mistakenly left a Petri dish containing staphylococcus plate. When he resumed the work in this day, in the morning he found that the plate which was left was contaminated with blue-green mold. A visible growth was formed. There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mold. Fleming concluded the mold released a substance that repressed the growth and caused lying of the bacteria.

To confirm this effect he grew a new culture and was able to discover the penicillin mold. Fleming termed it as penicillin.

The first cure with penicillin was recorded to be November 25, 1930. By 1942 the penicillin got widespread use. First it was used successfully then in 1945 the chemical structure of penicillin was determined. Since then the penicillin is used extensively as an antibiotic till date.

A mistake and then careful judgment of that event gave birth to an antibiotic that cures diseases for many decades. This is the life of the human beings; anything can happen.

There is an opportunity to take advantage out of any unfortunate situations.

Einstein's mass energy relation was one of the highest concepts to unravel the enigma of the universe. The energy can't be destroyed; just it can be transferred from one form to other. That concept solves many problems and also helps the human being to generate energy for its habitation. We can't see the flow of energy but we can feel it by other means.

In the first chapter of this book it is discussed about the dark energy and dark matter. The percentage of these two is much higher than the physical matter that we see in the whole universe. The mankind could see the expansion of the universe through scientific observations. For the expansion energy is required. Without energy nothing could be expanded.

Where does this dark energy come from? The concept of dark matter could satisfy the presence of dark energy. Dark matter is not visible to naked eye. Dark matter does not stay for long time. This appears in the space and disappears. The appearance and disappearance generates energy. This energy is dark energy and concentration is tens of times higher than the physical matter.

The enigma of dark matter and dark energy is yet to be solved. I guess that when the nature of the dark matter and the dark energy could be known to the mankind many problems could be solved. But in other way if this is the energy of the divinity that runs the universe, the mankind might not be able to know its nature.

Is it predictable the presence of the dark energy before the Big Bang explosion?

Was it the dark matter that used for the Big Bang explosion?

Up to date we are considering four states of matter; solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Just after the Big Bang explosion within 10-12s the whole matter was in plasma state. Then within few minutes gases like hydrogen and helium were formed. Then the formation of the solid elements started. As there is not any liquid fundamental element like gas and solid, liquid would have formed later in the nature.

The human beings are successful to define and explain the four states of matter. My doubt is that is there any state of matter beyond these four states?

Is there fifth state of matter in the nature?

If so, then where it is, how the human being could be able to define and explain this state of matter?

If we see the sequence in which the whole universe is generated that indicates towards this reality. The material used in the Big Bang explosion might be in the fifth state of the matter. The matter in fifth state may be in dark matter or dark energy or it is the consciousness of the higher self?

Is there any probability for the mankind to unravel the enigma of the fifth state of matter?

It would be another greatest invention for the mankind.

As we know from plasma gas can be made, from gas liquid can be made, and from liquid solid can be made. If we revere the process when solid is heated that produces liquid, when liquid is heated that produces gas and when gas is heated that produces plasma. Then what is beyond plasma?

If we see the amount of energy release from 1kg of solid, liquid, gas and plasma state of the matter, we would find that when we go from the solid to plasma state the amount of energy release is also increased. 1 kg of wood could generate ~17Mega Joule of energy whereas I kg of coal generate ~ 30 Mega Joule of energy. But the fission of uranium is an exception to any solid elements as far as energy release is concern. 1 Kg of uranium releases ~ 82 Tera Joule of energy by fission process.

The energy release from 1 Kg of any combustible liquid like crude oil, diesel, kerosene etc. varies from 42-50 Mega Joule of energy.

The energy release from any combustible gas like natural gas, LNG, LPG etc. varies from 47 – 55 Mega Joule. But the hydrogen could release energy of 142 Mega Joule.

The energy release from the fusion reactions of 1 kg deuterium with 1.5 kg of tritium could generate energy in the range of 840 Tera Joule in plasma state of matter.

So from the above estimation except the energy release from the fission of uranium, we could see that as we move from solid, liquid, gas and plasma states of matter, the material in these states generate energy in an increasing trend from the first state of matter to the fourth state of matter.

Could we assume that the elements in fifth state of matter could generate huge amount of energy than any of these four states of matter?

If we assume the presence of the fifth state of matter before the Big Bang explosion, no doubt the assumption of energy could be satisfied. Without energy and matter no explosion could be performed.

There are many such examples which were established for miraculous inventions and discoveries. At the end due to those miraculous inventions and discoveries the mankind either gets comfort or luxury.

Inventions and discoveries are not limited to science only. As many human beings are there in this world there are those numbers of life stories related to each individual. When life is running smooth hardly anybody puts pressure on his mind for thoughts. But when the life is scattered the human beings start thinking how to make life smooth. At that point of time many human beings become successful to discover the way suitable for them to overcome the difficulties.

Difficult time is the time when the inner strength of the human being could come out. During difficult time a matured person discover such facts about him that also surprises the person himself.

It would be great discovery for any individual when he would be able to discover any propensity of him that required refinement. The propensity which hurts the man himself as well as other human beings unnecessarily requires refinement. The discovery, recognition and action for rectification of such propensity could lead a person's life through a beautiful journey and at the end purification happens.

Each person is born with different potential. Dreams according to one's potential could lead to a point of success in life. But those futile dreams which are not according to one's potential could destroy the time and effort. It is required to discover the potential of any person. For this awareness is required.

Without awareness no discovery could be accomplished.

The world around us we see today is due to the discoveries of many facts and figures for millions of years. The inventions and discoveries of scientific origin gave a beautiful shape to the material world and thus provide comfort and luxury; whereas discoveries of philosophical origin by the sages, saints and philosophers provide many lessons for the purification and development of the consciousness.

Everybody contribute for the development of this world. Though people are working for themselves but in other way they are building this world. The population of the world is increasing day by day. So it is challenge for the mankind to provide all the basic material needs to each and every human being. It is required to increase the productivity of agricultural land. It is required to increase the productivity to supply the house hold products economically. It is required to increase the luxury products so that it could reach as many as people.

No doubts all the material needs could be fulfilled through science and technology. The subtle nature could be predicted by the scientific observations.

Seeing is believing. The scientific observations proof this fact. Unless there is repeated evidence of the same observation the scientific facts become invalid. Repeated evidence of the same observation when becomes valid and if suitable, takes the physical form for the utilization of the human habitation. From the inventions and discoveries to the final products this takes lots of effort to make the concept to physical form for the utilization in human life.

This is the reason why the great scientists take pride for their work.

As like the scientist, the philosophers create awareness in human mind through their logical thinking. That's why the philosophers also steel the pride for their work.

### The Power within Human Beings

The Supreme Soul has given more importance to the consciousness rather than the material world. The material world is made by the consciousness. The material world is of the consciousness. The material world is for the consciousness. Any material could be made only after its conceptualization in the mind. Through the material world the consciousness could be developed. The consciousness and the material world are complementary to each other. One makes the other and vice versa.

Without consciousness the material world could not be developed.

Without the material world it is difficult for the consciousness to develop.

But the consciousness plays superior role.

The unlimited potential of any human being is instilled in the consciousness. Though there is freedom of choice of the human beings, it becomes their choice to execute the unlimited potential. First one has to recognize the unlimited potential within him.

It is a fact that at one point of time not every human being desires to become the top leader of their land. There is a distribution of desire among human beings. Not every human being desires the same thing at one point of time. The human beings desire according to their requirements and ambitions.

Hope is a divine property. Hope shows the path to create opportunities in life. Hope is in the consciousness. It is not external to human beings. It is the property of the consciousness that guides the human beings to transcend in their life. Hope never dies. Hope guides the human beings to strong determination and strong determination fulfils the desire. It is up to the human beings what to desire and what not to.

It is up to the human beings to hope for the positivity. Hope for the positivity guides the human beings in positive direction. To choose positivity out of negative acts is a divine act. Positivity and negativity are complementary to each other. Any human being desires for positivity or hopes for positivity he should be prepared to face its negative effect.

Both positivity and negativity are creation of the Supreme Soul. There must be a purpose behind this duality. Why only positivity is not created? If there would not be negativity how we could say about positivity? Both are there; that's why we could distinguish between them.

Do you feel we should doubt on the Supreme Soul for creation of this duality?

We may not reach at the final conclusion of this duality but it is clear that the virtue of anything could be known when that shows stronger character in adverse situations.

To make the positivity superior; the choice of the divinity, things has to pass through the negativity. So negativity is necessary to find out positive character.

For the human beings it is required to choose positivity. Let the negativity stays only in the nature. Do not allow the negativity to touch your hope, your desire and your action.

It is required to set the trend for the positivity in the mind. Once the trend is set that automatically generate positive hope.

Positive hope is the inner strength of every human being.

It is like foundation of multi stories building. When the foundation is strong definitely the building stands strong.

Hope is the first and important step in human life. When hope becomes positive that sets a strong foundation to fulfil the desire.

Without desire nothing happens in life. Desire is a divine property that is instilled in the consciousness.

Set your desire to achieve things. But do not run behind it. As it is said by Buddha that the desire is the root cause of sorrow, it is required to know how to deal with desire and avoid sorrow.

Without desire it is difficult to create material world; with desire it could lead to sorrowful life; so what to do? The human habitation requires material world for fulfilment of their basic needs.

Is there any midway around so that the human beings could create material world through their desire and keep themselves away from sorrow generated by desire?

Yes, there is a midway and the ultimate way that could lead to create things through desire and keep away from sorrow. That is way of Samarpan; that is surrendering all the activities unto the Supreme Soul.

If we see the relationship of the water drop with the lotus leaf we could understand the meaning of Samarpan.

As a liquid, when the water falls on a solid surface spreads over it and even the water is absorbed by the solid surface. When water falls on a solid surface it becomes part of the solid. It becomes difficult to distinguish between water and the solid.

When water fall on the surface of a lotus leaf, its behaviour change. Though the water drop stays over the lotus leaf, utilizes the lotus leaf as its support still it does not become part of it. The water is not absorbed by the lotus leaf. We could clearly distinguish between water drop and the lotus leaf.

This is the relationship required by the human beings. Desire to develop things for your basic needs, desire for your career, desire for property, desire to achieve higher goals, desire to create opportunities for you and for others but do not involve in it.

Is it possible to keep away from desire?

Yes, it is. It is possible through faith on divinity. The faith is an element of the consciousness. Through faith one could keep him away from sorrow even when he is desirous to achieve something.

Faith energies the body and inspires the mind of the human being. Faith guides the human beings to work in right direction. Faith has tremendous power. One has to recognize it and utilize it. Faith is not external rather it is the inner property and strength of the consciousness.

When you generate faith on the Supreme Soul then do not doubt. Faith and doubt do not work together. Only faith is required. Once strong faith is generated in the mind the next step is acceptance. Whatever you are getting through your faith accept the out come easily.

Keep one thing in mind that we are made by the choice of the Supreme Soul. We are made for specific purpose. What we are getting and what we are not getting that is a secret for our life. We could see only the short term goals. When the goal is not achieved we become scattered. But we do not know about the long term goal of ours set by the divinity. We are ignorant to know the purpose of the divinity for making our daily life.

Acceptance of what we have lead to happy life. For success in life, along with acceptance of what we have it is required to keep the desire alive. The acceptance leads to happiness whereas the desire opens up the way for further achievement.

Both acceptance and desire are required for success. Both ways could be adopted together.

Acceptance and desire together could keep the human being away from sorrow.

There are two other aspects those create confusion in human life; ego and possessiveness. As I told every action has dual properties like positivity and negativity; ego and possessiveness has also two sides. One side push the human being for creativity and the other side push the human being for destruction. Ego and possessiveness are not artificial. These are not manmade. These are created by the Supreme Soul. These are the feelings which were created earlier than the creation of the whole universe.

For the creation of the material world ego is required and to sustain the growth of the material world possessiveness is required.

If the feelings of ego and possessiveness would not have created earlier than the creation of the whole universe, it might have became impossible for the Supreme Soul to create the whole universe.

But the human beings are different than the Supreme Soul. The human being has to learn how to generate ego and possessiveness and how to channelize these two feelings for betterment of his life.

The unlimited potential of the human beings are there through ego and possessiveness. For creation, ego is required and for maintenance, possessiveness is required. As the human beings are not like the Supreme Soul, they need to create the awareness to use these two unlimited potential within them.

One thumb rule is there to utilize these two feelings. That is not to hurt anybody's emotion, life or property for the sack of the feelings of supremacy or savage satisfaction. When this thumb rule is followed correctly the ego and the possessiveness could be channelized in positive manner for creativity.

One has the freedom of choice to channelize these two feelings for achievement of the spiritual goal.

Will power is another gift of the Supreme Soul for the human beings. Will power is that power of the mind by virtue of which the human beings could achieve the things beyond imagination. The will power makes the human being able to do what a normal person even could not imagine.

Things happen randomly. With physical infirmities when the human beings could not seem to be physically fit they do something and achieve the heights in many fields like art, sports, science, literature etc.

Though physical infirmities become a limit to many human beings, when the freewill over power the infirmities the person stands at a higher goal. Will power has that potential to make a difficult goal achievable. Will power generates a tendency in the mind, generates energy in the body.

Will power is not external rather it is a property of the consciousness. It is a divine property that shares with the human beings.

When the human being generates faith on own self as well as on the Supreme Soul the will power becomes stronger. The faith on a fact that we are here to flourish not to perish shows many paths to choose for the betterment of one's life.

Though all the human beings are not at same levels with respect to financial, intellectual, social etc. they could raise their will power to same level. They have the potential to do so. The goal is high or low that does not matter but achievement does matter.

It may become difficult to achieve even a lower goal for a normal man but the person having higher will power could achieve it.

Will power opens up opportunities. There are many opportunities for the human beings. Opportunities do not die rather that multiplies. Due to modernization of the material world, opportunities for earning money go many folds. To capitalize any opportunity the will power is required.

The will power creates awareness. Due to the awareness the human beings could be able to recognize an opportunity suitable to his potential.

When a person chooses an opportunity suitable for his potential that gives success. When a person chooses an opportunity much higher than his potential that becomes impossible to achieve.

In human life two of the goals should be health and happiness. Even with moderate salary one could stay healthy and happy. Happiness is a state of the mind. Happiness should not be spoiled because of the desire for the unachievable goals. Rather the human being should find out other opportunities for which he could stay with happiness.

The state of the mind also affects the health. The thoughts have a great impact on the human body even in micro levels. A positive thought creates positive vibration in the human body. The whole body experiences a soothing effect due to positive and happy thoughts.

The negative thoughts create wrong vibrations in the cell of the human body. This is a fact. You can also experience this effect. When you are angry for any reason for few minutes you could feel rise in temperature in the body. The cells of the body vibrate violently. These vibrations raise the temperature of the body. When this becomes a regular phenomenon in any human life this leads to chronic diseases.

As we see thoughts could raise the temperature of the body, is it a type of energy?

Without energy it is difficult to raise the temperature of any physical body.

What shorts of energy is there with the thoughts?

Chronic resentment leads a human body for hypertension. Resentment creates negative vibration in the cells of the human body. Regular negative vibrations in the human body lead to hypertension.

The cause of the stomach ulcer is not physical. It is hardly due to any physical reason a person suffers from stomach ulcer. Rather the stomach ulcer is due to fear, anxiety and worry. Instead of taking medicine if a stomach ulcer patient could be able to control the fear, anxiety and worry, definitely he could get relief from stomach ulcer.

The whole universe is controlled through cause and effect. To do any work it is required to find out the cause of it. Without finding out the cause when any action is performed that goes waste.

Likewise when a stomach ulcer patient stops the cause of it i. e. the fear, anxiety and worry definitely he would enjoy its effect. The effect is the relief from stomach ulcer.

When a hypertension person stops thinking about the resentment, stays happy and keeps him engaged in joyful activities that leads the person for relief from the hypertension.

Once a person is successful in tracing the cause of any misfortune he could definitely come out of it. As the happiness and the healthiness are the game of the mind, the human beings should set the trend in the mind for it.

The human beings have that power within them to set the trend for health and happiness. This power of the mind is divine. This power is instilled by the Supreme Soul in the consciousness of the human beings.

As discussed in the above paragraphs in this chapter there are many important factors those shape human life. The factor like hope, positive thought, desire, acceptance, faith, will power, ego, possessiveness and happiness are the matter of the mind; are the matters of the consciousness. These feelings are not manmade rather these are creation of the Supreme Soul. These feelings are indispensable feelings required for the development of the consciousness.

There are few feelings like ego, possessiveness, desire which becomes very dangerous when not utilized properly. There is a law of contrast. This is a natural law. That means there will be duality of many factors or properties like ego, possessiveness and desire. But when utilized for creativity it shows tremendous potential for the growth of the mankind.

The physical world is temporary but the consciousness is eternal. The physical world is the medium for the development of the consciousness. The development of the consciousness is possible only through the development of the above said feelings. The feelings of hope, positive thinking, acceptance, faith, will power, desire, ego, possessiveness and happiness always stay with the consciousness.

Strong determination is another feeling which helps the human beings to achieve all of the above feelings.

All the properties of the mind could be developed through the activities of the mind. The meditation is one of the activities of the mind which allows the human beings to set the trends for positivity, hope, faith etc.

Meditation is the state of the mind free from doubts, puzzles, delusion etc. At this stage it becomes easy to programme the mind. The subconscious mind becomes active at the meditative stage of the mind. The programming done at this stage affects the subconscious mind. The programming could be done for positive thinking, hope, acceptance, desire, happiness, ego, possessiveness etc. Meditation helps the human beings to set the trend for all the properties of the mind.

A regular practice of the meditation makes the human mind more powerful with all these elements.

A daily practice of the meditation is preferable. A dedicated time for ½ to 1 hour for this purpose is required. As it is the most important act of the day and it makes other activities easy, there should not be any hesitation to devote some time for it.

This increases the inner strength of the human mind. This explores the power of freewill, faith, hope etc.

When any person becomes restless the breathing becomes violent. By slowing down the breathing the person could come down to a calm state. When mind becomes restless breathing becomes violent, when breathing becomes slow mind achieves calmness. So there is direct connection between mind and breathing.

The practice of the pranayam keeps the mind in calm state. To achieve meditative state pranayam does enormous work. A rhythmic and soothing inhale and exhale could calm down the mind. Even this can also helps the mind to be free from unwanted thoughts.

When the mind is free from unwanted thoughts it becomes easy to programme it for powerful feelings like hope, faith, positive thinking etc.

There is enormous power within the human mind. The power within each human being is enough to make his life happy and healthy. It is the responsibility of the human being to recognize this power. It is the responsibility of the human being to cultivate this power within him. There are ways like meditation, execution of freewill to cultivate the inner strength.

The Supreme Soul makes the human beings by his choice for a purpose. The Supreme Soul instilled the power within the human beings to achieve this purpose. And the Supreme Soul makes the human being more powerful by the blessings of the freewill.

So my dear reader, enhance an attitude of the gratitude for the Supreme Soul for making this beautiful universe and most importantly for making you as a part of it. Human beings are the part of the Supreme Soul; part of the Supreme consciousness. They are not separate.

### Chapter-8

### Life Force Energy

The name of this energy indicates its relation with life. Any non living element is without this energy. The life force energy helps the consciousness to be involved in a physical body. In the previous chapter it is told that the consciousness needs a physical body as a medium for its growth. The life force energy makes bridge between the physical body and the consciousness.

Through the previous discussions we could know that the development of the consciousness is the ultimate purpose for the human birth. For development of the consciousness a healthy physical body is required. To keep the physical body healthy the life force energy is working perpetually throughout the life of the living entity. The life force energy works for both health and the consciousness.

There is a great importance of the life force energy in the life of the living entities and specifically in human life.

The life force energy is incorporeal and subtle. Due to its subtle nature it becomes very difficult for the each and every human being to realize it. Only a small fraction of the whole mankind could realize the existence, utilization and benefits of this energy.

The power of the life force energy is enormous. This works in the physical body as well as in time. The life force energy could pervade the whole universe. Its origin is subtle, its action is subtle. Only through the outcome of this energy one could realize its existence.

The life force energy is working in the basis of the natural law. It is there throughout the universe. It has its own action. It is the energy of the divinity. The human beings are blessed to direct this energy for their benefit.

The Supreme Soul makes the mankind in such a way that they could develop themselves by many different ways. The human beings are empowered by different energy and blessed with some qualities to utilize it.

A developed consciousness could realize this energy and also utilize it. The person, who realizes the life force energy, could develop his consciousness. Both the consciousness and the life force energy are incorporeal and subtle. They need the help of each other for their development in a human life. Both the consciousness and the life force energy are of same origin; that is from the Supreme Soul.

The life force energy works in physical, moral and temporal world. The life force energy could keep the physical, moral and temporal world to perfect the order. Likewise the life force energy works on physical health, moral health and also past, present and future time of a human being.

As the nature of the life force energy is subtle it is difficult for scientific experiments through instruments. The existence and utilization of the life force energy were invented thousands of years back by saints, sages and philosophers. This energy was utilized by the saints, sages for many different purposes.

In previous chapters we have seen evidences for the incarnations of the Supreme Soul in human body to create awareness in human beings. Likewise the Supreme Soul might have taught the mankind about the existence, utilization and benefits of the life force energy. Without the creator who would be able to know the subtle nature of this energy?

The awareness about the life force energy is generated through the spiritual legacy. Once it was invented this was passed through the ages of this universe by saints, sages and the practitioners. The awareness for the life force energy could be created by the knowledge acquired from the spiritual legacy.

The ancient time saints and sages did good quality work. Though they were unaware of the physical nature of the material world they had succeeded by unravelling the subtle nature of the universe in many ways. They had succeeded unravelling the power of the life force energy.

The life force has different identity in different parts of the world like Prana Shakti, Sanjeevani, Reiki, Chi Shakti etc. Modern man is well fascinated about this energy.

Restless life style due to modernization of the material world compels the human being to find out a different way to get peace of mind, healthy life style and also inner strength to get things in order in his life. Keeping things in order is a natural law. To keep things in order in human life there is nothing wrong in seeking help from the higher self.

The connection between the human being and the higher self could be established through the life force energy. The life force energy perpetually flows from the universe to the human body and vice versa.

The life force energy helps the human being to keep the correct order of his physical body. The life force energy helps the human being to rectify any disorder and disease in his physical body. In human body disease and disorder may be considered as two different situations.

A fracture bone of a leg by an accident may be considered as disorder whereas diabetic or hypertension may be considered as disease. Disorder may be of artificial and natural. The life force energy may be effective to make an order to artificial disorder of the physical body. It may become difficult but not unexpected to keep an order to naturally disorder in physical body.

There are many different ways to keep the life force energy at a higher level in human life. The life force energy always keeps on flowing in between human body and the nature. Physical exercise of the body is a first requirement for good flow of life force energy. This keeps the body fit, the cells rejuvenated and remove any blockage in the joints in the body. The physical exercise clears the path for the free flow of the life force energy to each and every part of the body. Yoga asana is beneficial for this purpose.

Secondly the pranayam helps the life force energy to flow into each and every parts of the body. Pranayam allows the flow of oxygen to each and every parts of the body. Though during inhale and exhale the human being takes oxygen and leaves unwanted elements through this process the life force energy enters into the body. Through oxygen the life force energy enters into the brain.

Another way of acquiring life force energy is meditation. Through meditation the human beings could gain more life force energy from the nature. The state of meditation is a perfect stage for the life force energy to enter into the body enormously. The life force energy is there in the nature always; it is flowing into each and every living being but the person who tries to acquire more life force energy and take the benefits of it, he has to put extra efforts.

Physical exercise, yoga, pranayam are physical methods where as the process of meditation is subtle. Acquisition and application of the life force energy could be accomplished in better way through meditation.

Nature keeps everything necessary for human life. It is up to the human being how would he create awareness and get the benefits is up to him, up to his freewill and effort.

### Samarpan

### Preface

Samarpan, i.e. giving up all the activities unto the Supreme Soul is a book that I wish to write on the basis of strengthening the human intellect towards the reality of modern life. In this age of materialization the human being become more anxious for achieving new heights in all sphere of life. Due to the anxiety, the human mind deviates from the reality, deviates from recognizing the purpose of life, the purpose of the universe, the purpose of the Supreme Soul for making the mankind. The human mind deviates from knowing the human character.

I have tried to explain few aspects of human life on the basis of which one could realize the purpose of his existence. When the human being is able to know the purpose of his existence, definitely he would succeed in his life. We are here to succeed. The Supreme Soul makes the mankind to savour the beauty of the universe.

This book would be helpful for all professionals and relevant to everyone irrespective of age, sex, religion and nationality.

When we watch a movie few scenes are more attractive than others, still we watch the whole movie.

### Spiritual Youth

### Preface

Spiritual Youth is philosophical thoughts to empower the modern man. In the age of modernization of the material world, the modern men become restless and ignore to realize the real world. Through this book I have tried to discuss a philosophy that would help the modern men to enjoy the material world with real sense.

Spiritual Youth does not preach the men to go away from the material world rather it emphasizes the growth of the men in the material world. The material world is made for the human beings. The philosophy discussed in this book may help the human beings to create opportunity for their growth, to realize their existence and to realize the divinity within them while enjoying the material world.

The philosophy discussed in this book may help the human beings to recognize the power of his freewill and how to execute it. This book covers most of the elements of human life like health, wealth, success and happiness. Those who pick up this book are requested to read completely and if necessary read it many times. I hope this book will be helpful to know yourself, to know your responsibilities and to know how to achieve the goals in your life.

The emphasis is given for self realization through self analysis. The person himself is the best critics for his work and words. You are made to win; you are made to enjoy this magnificent creation of the Supreme Soul.

The human beings are here in this universe to flourish not to perish.
