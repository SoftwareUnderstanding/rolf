Chapter One

The smell of exhaust fumes and gasoline mingled in my lungs. I exhaled quickly and tried to take in fresh air. Sharp talons of smoke stung my eyes. My father pressed the car keys into my unsteady hands.

" _Lucky, focus dammit," he growled, gaining my attention. He never called me by my first name without purpose. "I need you to listen carefully, Baby Blu," his voice softened but the tension never left his face and his eyes remained sharp and steady._

" _Take Aiden home. His grandparents will be waiting for him. Then go home and don't speak to anyone." Shock set my heart at an impossible pace. The dangerous tempo threatened to bust my ribcage open. I nodded mechanically and gripped the keys in my hand. Cold sweat broke out in a relay down my back soaking my blue silk party dress. He hugged me tightly then pushed me away and walked towards the wreckage. The echoes of police sirens prompted my body to move on autopilot. Aiden was snoring loudly in the backseat._

The air in the small sedan was contaminated with the smell of rum. Hot tears singed my cheeks as I drove towards the Wainwright estate. Foster and Elizabeth were waiting with Eliot, their butler, anxiously. The car barely came to a stop before Eliot lifted Aiden's limp form out of the back seat and carried him through the massive front doors. His grandparents kissed my cheek through the open driver's side window while whispering confusing words of gratitude and praise.

I drove the short distance back to my house. Thankfully our properties shared a back fence and I was able to take the access road. Once inside the safety of my own home, my knees collapsed as my body gave in to the devastating tremors.

Letta Leigh, our housekeeper, rounded the corner out of the study at top speed and caught my head against her stomach before it got fully acquainted with the Spanish tile of the grand foyer.

" _I just got off the phone with Scott Wainwright. What happened?" She stroked my back trying to coax an answer out of me._

" _Allison Wainwright is dead!" I screamed before the world went completely dark._

The blaring wail of my alarm clock chased away any lingering lethargy hovering around the outer edges of my brain. The left side of my brain pulsed in warning of the impending migraine. Slamming a hand down on the alarm clock, my palm abused the dismiss button. I pushed myself out of bed started towards the large adjacent bathroom.

Natural light streamed in from the sun panels in the ceiling and the wide windows on the far side of the room. I stripped away my night clothes and grabbed my toothbrush and paste before heading into the separate shower stall.

It was going to be one of those days—I mused while praying that the steam would alleviate some of the pressure building at the base of my skull. Whenever I dreamt about that night, three years ago, headaches always followed.

Tension migraines is what the neurologist called it, concerned with the therapist's report. Twenty minutes later, it was evident the migraine would win today. I popped two pills dry, after dressing and pulled my hair out its protective wrap. Thick dark strands fell around my shoulders as I brushed my bangs to the side before adjusting my yellow head band.

With my yellow tie straightened and the grey pleated skirt of my uniform wrinkle-free, I grabbed the matching blazer and messenger bag and headed down to the breakfast room.

Summer was chatting animatedly as she pranced around the room in the Abington Academy high school uniform. Although the middle school and high school were housed on the same campus, the middle school uniform was different. In high school, the only thing that separated the masses was the color of our ties.

Last semester, Summer worked her ass off and was promoted to the ninth grade half year early. To make up for lost time, she would have to attend summer school. She happily patted her pink tie under the grey sweater vest.

"Good morning, fellow high school student," she chirped dramatically. I grabbed a muffin of the table and a can of red bull. Hopefully the caffeine would jumpstart the migraine meds.

"C'mon Summer, I have a senior meeting this morning," kissing Letta Leigh on the cheek, I headed towards the garage while my sister squealed loudly behind me.

The engine of the black Audi TT purred as it pulled into the crowded parking lot of Abington Academy. I pulled into the assigned spot in the senior lot and parked her. Summer jumped out of the car and ran to her waiting friends before I could pull the keys out of the ignition.

Straightening my tie one last time, I got out of the car and made the short walk over to the senior building. Generations of generous benefactors and alumni had kept the school's old colonial style architecture pristine. Abington Academy was as large as any college campus. The entire school sat on a sprawling five acres of land, with fully operating stables and riding trails.

I kept my head up and eyes off of anyone in particular as I made my way to my locker. It wasn't that people picked on me, because they didn't. Usually, they just avoided me in hopes of not being caught up in the crosshairs of social suicide. It didn't bother me much. In less than three months, I would be out of this place. Reaching my full sized locker at the end of the hall, I pulled it open and hung up my blazer. It was March and the weather was nice. The teachers usually left the windows open.

I adjusted the soft heather gray sweater vest and stared down hall in the direction of the English wing when I spotted Aiden with Lisa Tremaine.

Pain etched in my heart as I watched him lean against the lockers, Lisa pressed into his side as he half-heartedly listened to one of his jackass friends recounting of his weekend festivities. To everyone else, he was engrossed in the groups' conversation. His arm wrapped around the plastic prima donna, and a brief twang of envy swept through me. No, I don't envy her like that.

Aiden and I once had that... He used to put flowers in my hair. Sadness weighed down on me until his emerald eyes caught mine. My spine stiffened holding me straight—mask firmly in place. He quirked a perfectly arched brow in my direction and smirked before returning his attention to his friends. Unfortunately for me, Lisa caught our brief mental melee. Rolling my eyes, I turned my attention back to my locker, removing my books for my next three classes. I tried to frequent my locker as little as possible to avoid unnecessary run-ins with Aiden's friends.

"See something you like?" The high pitch of Lisa's voice always grated my last nerves. Auburn ringlets hung past her shoulders in perfect order. Ignoring her, I shoved my books into my messenger bag. Kayla, one of her evil minions, slammed the door of my locker closed. I looked up at her in exasperation and sighed.

"What do you want?" I finally asked. It was bad enough; I had to go to the same school with her since we were toddlers. Due to the dense population of our academy, I didn't mind most of the times. It was when I had to actually acknowledge her existence that I could hardly stomach.

She laughed maniacally...like one of those evil queens from the depths of anime hell out for world destruction.

"There is not a thing in the world that I could possibly want from you, my dear," she tapped her chin in false contemplation. "But I bet there is one thing that I have that not even you could afford."

I cocked my head to the side, bangs falling into my eyes and for once I didn't mind. They hid the spite that threatened to erupt within me like a hot geyser. Jesus, she gives me heart burn! Before I could pull it back, the words spilled forward.

"You know, gambling is a bad habit. My father recently, recommended a support group to your father. Maybe you should consider attending with him." I smiled politely, but didn't bother to hide the sarcasm that tainted the false sympathy in my voice. Astral Moon Financial Group was one of the oldest and largest financial management companies in the country. It just so happened that the company was owned by my family and they managed the financial portfolios of every family in the immediate area.

I knew I shouldn't have let that tidbit of information slip, but it was too hard to resist. Shock doused Lisa like a wave of cold water. She stuttered, trying to form the words for a proper, coherent retort. The rumors of her father's gambling problems were only whispered among the tightest of inner circles. Not all of her friends were privy to her family's problems; Kayla was a prime example of one of those friends.

Aiden, who had been standing nearby (and listening, I'm sure), swooped in and dragged Lisa along with him. He quickly tipped his head in my direction; amusement twinkled in his eyes. This round had gone to me; however, this was only the beginning of the day. I knew that he would try something sooner or later.

I looked up to see Kayla still standing there, mouth hanging open. Her family had acquired their wealth when her father got his hooks into the internet boom in the early nineties. Most of the students that attended our school had family wealth that could be traced back to the founding of this country—not hers.

Kayla turned a bright shade of red as she stood there silently staring at me. I smiled at her before she turned and fled down hall behind her master. Several students, who had stopped to watch our amusing little interlude turned away as a glanced around the hall. Suddenly, I felt bad for letting the cat out of the bag. Okay, so I only felt a little bad. It was one of the reasons why no one beyond Aiden's inner circle really messed with me. They were afraid that with one word, I could bring their trust funds down around their ears. I exhaled audibly and made my way down the hall, avoiding eye contact with as many people as possible. This was going to be a long fucking day.

"That was a low blow," I rolled my eyes and my shoulders tensed briefly before dropping. I turned to find Adric Abington staring at me in disappointment. "That was cruel, even for a piece of work like her." If it wasn't already obvious, Adric Abington's family founded this academy. He was the son of a State Supreme Court judge and a southern bell. He was also one of the few friends that Aiden and I had in common. It was why I felt so bad. Adric, having grown up with both of us, refused to be a part in our war. I commended him for his ability to always stay Swiss.

At just over six feet, he wasn't as tall as Aiden, but his shoulders were broad and his frame lean. His aristocratic features gave him the air of an old lord, but his hazel eyes spoke of the lecher that lay beneath. He wrapped an arm around me and pulled me into his side. I didn't resist.

"You aren't going to make me apologize are you?" I shuddered at the thought. He laughed at my antics and led me down the hall towards our first class.

"Your guilt is good enough for me," he turned and looked at me seriously. I hated when he got all judicial and preachy but he said it was the fault of his breeding.

"We have a responsibility. Our circles are vicious," _ain't that the truth._ "But it is up to us how we navigate them. Now, ball's in his corner. You have first point. Let's see how the day goes," Adric tapped a finger on my nose and winked at me before ushering me into our advanced college calculus class. Why couldn't I have fallen for Adric? He was teenage perfection; rational and generous...even if he was more than a little promiscuous. His parents kept such a tight rein on his life outside of school; he claimed his lechery was his way of rebelling. It was the burden of old blood.

I ruffled his soft blonde hair before taking the seat next to his. He was right. I had given up the ball too soon in the day. A feeling of dread settled in the pit of my stomach like a heavy lead ball. I knew better than this. I had gotten complacent in our last months. The thumping in my head that had been reduced to a mild pulsing suddenly returned with a vengeance.

After eight, thankfully, uneventful hours I found Summer sat crying on the hood of my car flanked by her two best friends. Dual rivers of mascara stained her cheeks as she cried into her sports jacket. Miranda and Melissa Redding both clutched softball bats tightly and eyed anyone who dared to come too close or stare too long. Fear spread through me wide and thick like a suffocating blanket.

"What happened?" I demanded, gathering my trembling sister into my arms. She buried her face in my shoulder as violent sobs shook her small frame.

"Where is it?" I asked the twins. Melissa held up the grey Abington blazer for me to see. On the back, "Death Slut" had been spray painted in bold red letters on the back. Miranda held up her messenger bag, "redrum" was sprayed in red on the front flapped.

"Fucking original," I muttered as hot fury left my tongue thick and dry in my mouth. Taking the blazer and bag from them, I tossed Melissa my keys. I fought to contain the heated rage that beat at my back with a spiked whip. He had gone too far.

"Make sure no one bothers her," I instructed the twins before taking off in search of my prey. Students, who had lingered for various afterschool activities, stared and whispered as I passed them—they knew.

Aiden was holed up in an old classroom with his entourage. Lisa was strewn across his lap, fingers in his hair. His cool nonchalance fueled the anger that jumped through my blood. Slamming the door open, I stepped through and watched in satisfaction as a few bodies jumped.

"Wainwright, outside, now," I left no room for argument from him. Lisa tensed up as she visibly coiled for an attack like the poisonous snake that she was.

"Who the fuck do you think you are?"

As always, she missed the obvious _you don't want none of this_ tone I'd used. Pinning her with an icy stare I explained, "The bitch who can bring your vapid little crystalline world down around your pretty little ears if you say another word to me today." With that, I left the room without looking back.

Moments later, Aiden wandered into the hall and leaned a shoulder against the wall of lockers.

"What do you want? Besides me, of course," he asked. Aiden was the picture of tranquility while I seethed visibly. Ignoring his comment, I handed him Summer's belongings. For a moment, it looked like the same fury that rode me hard, licked him briefly. _Impossible_ , I declared silently. _For that to be possible, he would need a soul_.

"She had nothing to do with this," was all he said— maybe he was just a little human.

"Listen carefully, Wainwright, because this may go a little fast for you to process and I won't repeat myself. Torment me all you want but leave Summer out of this. If you and your bunch of gated community gangster wannabes bother my sister again, I'll cut off your balls and tack them to the school marquee so not even your big ego could hide just how small your family stones really are." I took a deep, much needed breath.

After brief contemplation, Aiden simply nodded and walked back into the classroom. Everyone looked at him expectantly, when I followed him in. Aiden lifted Summer's damaged things for his minions to see.

A chorus of laughter rang out that set my teeth on edge. Lisa and two other girls high fived each other—it was like something out of shitty D-list teenage movie.

"Micki did quite a number didn't she?" Lisa laughed. Micki was her little sister and biggest fan—which left much to be desired about her taste in...well, pretty much everything.

The group's amusement only fueled my fury. I had never been one for violence, but just seeing that disgusting smirk on her face made me want to reach over and smack her so hard that her dentist would be extracting enamel from her esophagus for the next month.

Aiden snatched the blazer from insignificant groupie number two and held it up again, irritated.

"Summer Moon is off limits," he announced and everyone shut up. Lisa had the nerve to look offended.

"My sister spent..." she started but was cut short by Aiden's arctic glare.

"Your sister will deal with me, as well as anyone else who messes with her." A sea of solemn nods spread before me at his decree. I suppose coming from one of the country's oldest and wealthiest families made it possible for such undisputed declarations.

Lisa huffed briefly but kept her mouth closed. Aiden nodded in my direction, effectively dismissing me—so I left. There were rules in every war. This was just one of mine.
Chapter Two

It took a while to calm Summer down and convince her that I had taken care of things. After settling her into her room with a bowl of green tea sherbert and a promise of a spa day during the weekend, she finally quieted down. I was grateful that everyone was out of the house. I made my way to my side of the house on the second floor.

I nearly stopped short when I opened the door but I knew better. _And it just keeps getting better_.

"Get out," I unbuttoned my shirt and undid my tie after kicking off my shoes.

"You know why I'm here," he lounged in the ivory and cream chaise and propped his feet up on the low mahogany coffee table in the sitting are of my room.

"Not today Dawson's Freak," I grumbled as I pushed his Italian loafers off of the table. His black hair curled around his ears and fell into his eyes as he smirked at me. Crossing the room, I tossed my shirt, tie, and vest in to the hamper. I didn't hear him come up behind me until his warm hands gripped my bare waist. Soft lips whispered butterfly kisses at the base of my neck. Tendrils of excitement danced in my belly causing goose bumps to rise on my skin.

"Liar," he whispered in my ear.

Tiny shocks of pain laced with jolts of pleasure coursed through me and settled between my thighs when he bit my ear and pulled me against the hard length of his body. His erection pressed against the small of my back and I bit my lip to suppress a moan. The sharp nip of my own teeth abusing my flesh brought me back to reality. I pushed away from him and crossed my arms across my chest. We both struggled to bring air to our lungs.

"Leave," I managed to stamp out more forcefully.

"That's not what you want," he dragged a hand through inky black hair.

"You don't know shit about what I want, Aiden." He licked his lips; his obvious stare piqued my nipples almost painfully against the lace material of my bra.

"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you." I told him, trying to shift my attention from his mouth.

"Glad you understand that the feeling's mutual," he stepped forward and his arm shot out, slamming our bodies together again. His arm held me immobile as his mouth crashed down onto mine. His free hand tangled in my hair dislodging the pins.

Involuntarily, my arms circled his neck, desperate for a closer feel. _How was it possible that a boy so cold and cruel could have such soft lips?_ It was official— the fates fucking hated me.

"I hate you," I moaned in his ear as the cold closet door slammed against my back. Aiden bit my neck before licking the minor hurt and kissing my jawline.

"Ditto," he muttered between kisses. The clasp of my bra snapped and it pinched against my skin.

"That was expensive." I frowned gripping his shoulders—his tongue licking my nipple made it hard to focus.

"I'll buy you a new one," he shrugged before taking my nipple into his mouth again. The world fractured into a million fragments and lightning struck in the room as I drowned in a storm of sheer ecstasy and fell apart in Aiden's arms.
Chapter Three

Mercifully, Aiden and his fan club stayed out of my way for the better part of the last three days. The days following an encounter with him always left me a little unbalanced. I tried not to think about it because it always sent me into an emotional tailspin. There was more than just loathing between us. There was also that intense craving that neither of us could deny. If we got too close, we were guaranteed to get burned. But what a sickeningly sweet burn it was. That settled it. I was a damn masochist.

At least he'd kept his promise. He always did. As promised, I'd found a small red gift bag on my bed when I'd gotten home from school. It was custom made high end demi- cup bra similar to the one that he'd broken. It fit perfectly. Of course he'd know my size. He sure played with my boobs enough.

"Need a pick me up or just looking to get picked up?" The deep Cajun twang sang in my ears. The sweet smell of grass after the rain filled my senses with a faint scent of men's cologne. I looked up into the most gorgeous brown eyes I had ever seen. They were soft and warm like caramel while slivers of gold swirled lazily within.

"I beg your pardon?" I snapped out of my reverie as his words sunk in. He sat on the opposite bench and leaned his head onto his hand and smiled languidly. Bright white teeth sparkled behind full pink lips. His tanned skin was smooth and silky as honey.

"No need to beg, sugar. I give willingly," his heavy southern accent seemed to add a lethargic spice to every word. I couldn't help but laugh. _Was this guy for real?_

"Trust me," I leaned in brushing his bangs out of his eyes. "I normally beg for no man."

"If the world were perfect you'd beg for now woman either," I laughed again, genuinely. It surprised me. He took my hand and pressed his lips to the back. "Jeremy Antoine La Fontaine. But please, Remy to one as beautiful as you."

"Slow down Rhett Butler." I giggled. "L.B. Moon or just Blu."

"And the _L_ is for..." He pressed closer. I gripped his hand and winked.

"If I told you—well you know how that line goes," he laughed deep and his chest and I felt the warmth of his mirth brush up against my heart.

"So now that we have the formalities out of the way, you going to tell me what has you so _bleu_ , my dear Blu."

"What makes you think that I need a pick me up?" I inquired placing the book mark in my journal before closing it.

"A girl doesn't wear brand new Christian Louboutin's to school without probable cause." He smiled again and my heart tilted to one side. I cocked a brow at him, failing miserably to hide my grin.

"Karma has been a bitch lately, so today I decided to tell her she can kiss my ass." He barked out another round of laughter, I didn't hesitate to join him this time.

"Where have you been all of my life, mon _petite_ oiseaux?"

"Have you seen these shoes? Do they look bayou friendly to you?" I laughed. He lifted my foot into his lap. The platform pumps were a gift to myself for the long hours I had put in avoiding Aiden and his gang for the last three days.

"Speaking of, why don't I detect Louisiana in your French?" I asked. He looked so careless with his tie undone and hair falling into his eyes...but it worked for him. Maybe the fates didn't hate me too much.

"My mother happens to be a world renowned photographer and my father owns several art galleries and auction houses. Needless to say, _'lazy swamp French'_ didn't cut it in gentle society. So, I was shipped off to a boarding school in Paris up until last month," he explained. I didn't protest when his strong hands massaged my calves. Ropes of comforting pleasure snaked up my legs and settled in my stomach. His touch didn't set off fireworks at my core, but he didn't put me on edge either. He was like a warm blanket on a cold night—just comfortable and like home. I hadn't felt like that since—in years. I peered at him through one open eye and caught him staring at a passing group of basketball players and cheerleaders. No, no...the fucking fates did hate me.

A sudden chill passed over me and the tiny hairs at the back of my neck stood on alert. The devil was close. Taking in my surroundings as subtly as possible, I tried to spot the dark haired bane of my existence. Remy still stared at the group of jocks, playing eye porn with one of the cheerleaders while his hands still massaged my calves.

Someone cleared their throat behind me. I didn't have to turn to know it was _him_. His cologne gave him away as it invaded my space— much like his presence in my life. It was typical and I was accustomed to it by now. Now Remy eyed us curiously.

Aiden sat down next to me on the bench and I pulled my legs out of Remy's lap and almost felt sheepish. Almost. What the hell did I have to be embarrassed about?

"Aiden Wainwright," he stiffly introduced himself when it was evident that I wouldn't do it. Remy shook his hand and smiled lazily at him. It was apparent that wasn't intimidated by him in the least.

"Jeremy La Fontaine."

"Since I am familiar with all of Lucky's friends, I assume you are new." Our senior class only consisted of three hundred students and nearly all of us had gone to primary school together. So of course Aiden knew Remy was new.

Remy raised a perfectly arched brow in my direction. I served him a dry look that let him know if he dare used my first name, I'd be forced to put a hurting on him. Pervert just winked at me and grinned. He just might enjoy it. I couldn't stop the giggle that escaped.

"The mademoiselle and I were just getting acquainted," he took my hand in his and brushed his lips across my knuckles. I tried to fight my shit eating grin but failed. Aiden's body tensed beside me but his face remained neutral.

Instead, he wrapped his arm around my waist and pressed a kiss to my neck. I shivered involuntarily, my grin went into hiding. His touch stroked the remnants of excited my body experienced during our encounter. I hated us both equally at the moment.

"Careful with this one," Aiden warned. "She can be poisonous." His may have been at the forefront but I'm sure Remy recognized it for what it was. Aiden was staking his claim. I didn't find it funny, but clearly Remy did. He enjoyed it so much he barked out a laugh, much to my chagrin.

"Well then _friend_ , let's just hope she allows me the pleasure of taking a bite. She truly is quite the tempting morsel. Please tell me there is no antidote," Remy winked at him. As if life wasn't already interesting enough.

Finally the spiteful cat let go of my tongue. I shrugged out of Aiden's hold and gave him a dirty look. I gathered my things and took Remy's hand, "If you're quite through pissing on me, I believe I'll take Remy to the school gardens and show him my rendition of Adam and Eve."
Chapter Four

April 17, 2003

The last month, since Remy had come to Abington, had surrounded me with a foreign sense of peace. We had fun just talking about everything and discovered that we shared a similar fascination with numbers and finance despite his poetic soul. He claimed that his Southern Prince Charming act was the perfect camouflage for his intellect.

I didn't have to try as hard to avoid Aiden and his _clown_ -tourage with Remy around. It seemed like he came with his own patent brand of asshole repellant. We ate lunch in the music room where he usually played the piano. He waved off any direct compliments from me, claiming that our budding friendship was too genuine to require any praise. I understood what he meant...Although we flirted constantly, we both understood that it was harmless. It was part of the easy dynamic of our relationship.

Even Letta Leigh liked him—which I suspected had more to do with the fact that they were both from New Orleans more than anything. Normally, she had a fit when a boy came within ten feet of Summer and I, but she didn't even bat an eyelash at meeting him.

***************

"Since when are you Susie homemaker?" I screamed at the sudden sound of his voice and pulled back the glass door of the shower.

"What the fuck, Aiden?" I yelled, my ears buzzed with adrenaline. I swallowed large amounts of air as I tried to slow the speed of my raging heart. He leaned against the marble sink chewing on an apple as if it were normal to walk in on me in the shower. The hot water raining down on me did nothing to help the liquid heat pooling between my thighs. It pissed me off how he was always so damn carefree—like he was unaffected by everything that happened between us. I knew better—I could do it too...Even if it did take a little more effort on my part.

"Didn't anyone tell you not to answer a question with another?" He asked taking munching loudly.

"Remy was sick and needed someone to look after him while his parents were out of town," I answered washing the conditioner from my hair.

"I don't recall you and Letta Leigh ever coming over to take care of me when I had the flu two months ago."

"Remy isn't an ass and we like him."

"Name one woman who doesn't like me," I scoffed lightly as I cut off the shower and slid the door open. Aiden handed me a towel; I gladly took it and wrapped it around my soaking body.

He looked me up and down. "You hardly..."

"I'd be careful with that phrasing if I were you," I cut him off, rubbing lotion onto my legs. "To insinuate that I'm anything less than a woman would mean you get off on little girls." I challenged, standing straight and staring him down. "That would be a nasty little rumor now wouldn't it? The heir to the Wainwright fortune is into little girls. Who'd have thought that was possible?" I walked by brushed by him and without sparing him a second glance but I knew his usual blank mask was firmly in place. He didn't need to say anything for me to know that he was formulating a way to get back at me.

"You know the rules, Lucky. Drop your Cajun Casanova," he calmly demanded following me into closet.

"You're right, he is a Casanova. But that doesn't make him mine." I deliberately bent forward slowly as I slipped my panties on and arched my back more than necessary to adjust the matching strapless bra. Aiden's breath hitched and I knew he was just as turned on as I was. The bastard had a way of watching me, even when I wasn't looking, that was purely primal.

"He clings to you. Walks around like you're his."

"And yet you don't hang around me and still walk around like I'm yours."

"You are," he said staring at me hotly. "For the moment," he stepped towards me and I quickly threw on a yellow strapless sundress. His hands caught the hem of my dress as it hit my thigh running against my hot skin.

"When with him, you'll only think of me anyways," his fingers trailed the lace line of my quickly dampening panties and my pussy clenched in automatic response.

"Yes, but who gets the actual satisfaction of being there?" I goaded him, pushing him away, trying to catch my breath. Cold jade swirled in angry eyes.

"And to think I was here to be diplomatic."

"You don't have a diplomatic bone in your body."

"How would you know? You've only ever had one of my bones in you," he smirked and I stared at him evenly.

"Don't be crude," I quickly braided my curling hair into a tight braid.

"Summer doesn't think I'm as horrible as you say." I paused. Turning away from the mirror, I glared at him.

"Don't be so damn antsy. I just..." the room door burst open cutting Aiden off. Summer bounced into the room and stopped at the closet door beaming at us.

"Oh, I didn't realize you were still here," correction— she beamed at Aiden. She twirled her fingers in her straight, shoulder length hair.

"Yes, I was just delivering a message to your sister."

Did that psychopathic jackass just smile genuinely at her? I stared in disbelief behind my blank mask.

"Well, isn't he just the sweetest? He isn't as bad as those horrible girls that hang around him." She continued to gush taking placing a flirtatious hand on his arm. Aiden kissed the back of her hand.

"Again, I apologize for any discomfort you may have experienced. I have had a long chat with all of them and I guarantee that they will not bother you any longer." Where the fuck did Prince Charming come from? She stared up at him like she was the fairy princess and he was her fucking brave knight. What's worse, he was acting the part too!

"Blu, Aiden did the sweetest thing in the world. He bought me a new blazer and a Hello Kitty messenger bag," she squealed again. I loved my sister, but there were times I wanted to choke her. This was definitely one of them. Did she not recall the evil that possessed this boy?

I returned her smile, "That's great hun."

"Isn't it? I didn't even know that you knew I liked Hello Kitty," she turned her attention back to Aiden. He absorbed her adoration easily like an egomaniac running low on attention. I put on my sandals and brushed past them, ignoring their conversation.

"Oh Blu," Summer called as I snatched my purse off my bed. Discreetly, I bit down on my cheek to keep from groaning.

"Letta Leigh wanted me to tell you that the gumbo was ready to take over to the La Fontaine's."

"Yeah, ok," I said heading out the door. She could have just told me through the intercom. The pair followed behind me, still chatting annoyingly.

***************

Ten minutes later, I was still in the kitchen waiting for Letta Leigh to complete Remy's get well package.

"Remember to tell that boy to put the oil rub on his chest before he eats the gumbo," Letta Leigh fussed as she gathered everything in a box on the kitchen counter.

"I will _Tatie."_

"You sure you don't want me to go over with you? Ms. Cadence and your father are eating out for dinner tonight."

"Don't worry about it. This is your night off and you have a hot date with Mr. Fortier." I teased her lightly. "Besides, if I need anything I can always call Vincent." She nodded in agreement then gathered her purse and rushed out the door. Vincent was Letta Leigh's twenty-eight year old son. He was the executive chef of one of the exclusive restaurants in town. He often used us as his guinea pigs whenever he was experimenting with a new recipe and knew all of his mother's tricks. He would have to do as a replacement for her, if I needed anything. There was no way I was going to ruin this night for her. She hadn't dated once since her husband, Michel had died fourteen years ago. Mr. Fortier, the maître' D at the restaurant Vincent worked at, had been giving her, what Vince called _the sugar eye_ for quite some time now. It took a month to convince for us to convince her to put the man out of his misery.

I set my bag on the counter and reached for the box, but Aiden beat me to it.

"Why don't I just take you over?"

"That's not necessary."

"Don't be rude, Blu." Did Summer just scold me? What was she still doing here? Aiden smirked at me. Yet again, he was able to charm a Moon.

"I'm not being rude, Aiden is leaving and I have to go too. I told Remy I would be there in fifteen minutes," I quickly checked my watch. Of course I didn't tell him that but I didn't need Summer riding my ass now. She clung to his very presence like he was some kind of demi god. Not an hour ago, she was cursing him and all of his friends to the deepest depths of hell. Now she treated him, like his pubes were made of gold!

"It's only a few doors down from me, besides, my grandmother wanted to see you afterward to discuss your plans for your birthday." Aiden took the box again and headed out the front door. Grabbing my purse, I followed quietly, not wanting to fight with him anymore in front of Summer.

He put the box into the trunk as I slipped into his new low-slung black McLaren. He had gotten it as a Christmas present from his grandmother. The soft red leather of the seat felt good against my skin. I bit back a groan as he got into the car.

"Sweet ride, Aiden," Summer complimented as she leaned against my open door.

"Just let me know, and I'll give you a lift to school sometime," he offered before starting the car. She smiled and winked at him as she shut my door. I fought the insane urge to roll my eyes at her.

"Why are you doing this?"

"Jealous?"

"Hardly."

"I doubt it," he rebutted.

"I've had you remember? And I still don't like you." I stared out the window as he pulled out of the long drive. He didn't say a word to me except to remind me that his grandmother was expecting me when I left Remy's. He dropped the box in my hands and sped off before I could even catch my grip on the heavy package.

***************

"You know, you're lucky I like you." I spooned the gumbo into a bowl and brought it over to Remy. He had had been bedridden for the last three days. I had emailed him all of the assignments he needed to stay caught up. He wore red silk pajamas beneath a black silk robe as we sat in the kitchen. The oil mixture that Letta Leigh made him seemed to have worked to help him breathe better. The homemade remedies that she inherited from her Haitian grandmother always did the trick.

"Please, _cherie_ , you love me," he teased, shaggy hair falling over his face.

"Maybe if you weren't gay," I ate a spoonful of the spicy gumbo. Remy made a face before drinking his tea.

"Who me? Never. I just don't see the point in limiting my options." I laughed, almost bathing him in gumbo.

"No dear, that's just called greed."

"I am a _connoisseur_ of love," he shrugged a shoulder and smiled lazily.

"Lust," I corrected and we both laughed. It felt good being with him...easy. The fates may have kept me from finding a potential love, but I had a definite bona fide friend.

Up in his room, we stretched out on his king sized bed watching an old black and white samurai movie.

"So, how is it that your parents didn't mind putting you in a new school so late in your senior year?" I asked reaching for the popcorn between us.

"I got accepted to Duke early, so they didn't see a problem with having me with them." He answered drinking more tea. I nearly choked on my popcorn as I sat up to stare at him.

"What?"

"Yeah, that's where my parents met. So why not follow in their footsteps?"

"Shut up! I'm going to Duke! I got accepted back in September," I hurled myself across the large bed and into his arms.

"See the fates don't hate you that much," he mumbled into my hair as rogue tears stained my cheeks.

Chapter Five

It was now Friday and Remy still hadn't returned to school. After our tense encounter, Aiden had avoided me like the plague. I was thankful for small miracles. I knew I had to deal with him sooner or later but I wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth.

Student Court had just been adjourned for the day and I gathered the last of the documents and placed them in their respective ledgers. I was always the last to leave. I couldn't stand to see unfiled papers strewn about. I organized the documents according to case file.

I gathered the last of the student court documents and placed them in their designated ledger, according to case file, when the door clicked softly behind me.

"Give me your panties," Aiden's voice wrapped me in a haze of instant lust—a brief wave of disgust slipped through me. I turned to see him leaning against the teacher's desk. The sleeves to his white dress shirt pushed up high on strong forearms; arms crossed over a broad chest. I sat against my own desk as I turned his words over in my head. Quirking an eyebrow at him, I silently did as asked. The soft lace moist at his mere presence—I hated Aiden Wainwright. I knew he wasn't going to forget our confrontation two nights ago.

I threw them at him and he caught the scrap of lavender easily out of the air and tucked them into his pocket.

"Those are new."

"I know."

"I want them back, they're expensive."

"Believe me, I know."

My stomach pitched forward at the low timbre of his voice. He pushed off the desk and moved slowly towards me. I would eternally be the prey that he stalked to torment.

"Isn't Lisa around for your carnal amusement?" I asked in an attempt to dissuade him from his goal. I was angry how my body impatiently responded to his mere presence...anxious for his coming touch.

"She's busy preparing for next month's cotillion," he answered dismissively. "Besides, you and I have an arrangement to take care of," his warm hand brushed my cheek. I bit my lip to suppress oncoming moan, but no amount of squeezing my thighs could prevent the rush between them when he pulled me to him. His free hand lightly skimmed the bare skin beneath my skirt.

Involuntarily, I leaned into his touch. Ribbons of desire curled and tightened in my womb—pulsating at the very core of me. His touch always elicited such a powerful response from me. My lids wandered closed of their own volition as his lips danced over the skin of my exposed neck. My hands curled into his vest pulling him closer. His expert fingers slipped between my thighs coaxing a more eager, primal response. His erection pressed against my stomach as his fingers invaded my willing body. It was always wet and willing for him. _How sick am I?_

My muscles clenched around his fingers, riding them, milking him. He groaned in my ear and dropped his head onto my shoulder. My hands quickly undid his belt and dipped inside his pants.

Aiden had always been well endowed— isn't that just fitting? I couldn't even make fun of him for having a little dick? His other hand tightened on my hip when I gripped him between my hands and massaged the full length of him. His hips rocked forward. My hands moved to the same rhythm as his until we both struggled to breathe as release came crashing hard and hot around us. Aiden bit down on my shoulder as the last shudders of his orgasm racked him. Our breathing heavy and hands soaked in the evidence of what just happened we just leaned against one another for a moment.

"Why does this have to be like this?" I asked softly. Aiden held himself still for a moment before standing to his full height. A foreign look passed over his face before replacing it with a stony mask.

"These were the rules that you agreed to, Princess," he said as he righted his clothing. I pulled a pack of moist towelletes out of my bag and handed one to him. He took it silently and cleaned himself off. I felt stupid for asking, when I already knew the answer. No matter how much I wished it, I could never have the old Aiden back.

"Try not to be late to dinner. Only God knows why, but my grandmother is making a big deal out of your birthday." Surprise stiffened my spine as I quickly turned to face him. I could get no emotion out of him. I knew what today was for him, I just didn't expect him to be there for me.

"I won't," I stuttered, sounding like a simpleton. Heart still pounding, I watched him leave. Too late I realized that he still had my panties in his pocket.

"Son of a bitch," I cursed loudly at no one in particular. Hopefully, the school grounds weren't so crowded. Most club activities had already finished by the time Student Court proceedings were through.

My car was close to the gym. I always kept a spare set of panties in my gym locker but with the boy's championship game around the corner, they were bound to still be on campus. I would have to cross the entire campus to get to the lot. Unfortunately, it was unusually windy today and I had no plans on pulling a Monroe.

After twenty minutes of careful maneuvering, I made it to my car without incident. I'd been stopped twice for random chat but I managed a stellar poker face and was able to keep my skirt from floating up.

I slammed my head on the steering wheel and silently offered up three years of my life if the fates didn't let anything else go wrong today.

***************

"This is a family dinner, Aiden," Foster Wainwright scolded his grandson. He took a sip of his brandy before slamming the glass tumbler down on the table. Elizabeth, his wife, placed a pale and on his arm in silent comfort.

"Well, unless someone slept with a slave long ago, I don't see how this constitutes a family," Aiden swept his arm around the room indicating my father, Cadence, Summer, and I. Oxygen was sucked out of the air as a ring of collective gasps resounded. I merely rolled my eyes. If they hadn't been used to Aiden's antics by now, then they never would be.

"We are celebrating Blu's birthday this evening," Elizabeth smiled at her only grandson, shooting emerald daggers his way. A chill passed through him as his smirk faltered. He may give his father and grandfather grief, but absolutely no one crossed Elizabeth Wainwright. "So, _I_ would appreciate it if you behaved yourself," she motioned to the empty chair next to me.

"My apologies, Grandmother. Happy birthday, Lucky." He said pleasantly enough. However, I understood the look in his eye. I smoothed my hands over the skirt of my coral dress and muttered a quick thanks. I hated this man but he always managed to set my blood on fire.

"I had no idea it was your birthday," the cancerous lump attached to his arm, also known as Lisa, finally spoke. The annoyingly high pitch of her voice grating against my eardrums.

I smiled politely, "Thank you, Lisa." Years of dealing with Aiden had allowed me to gain Jedi master status when it came to schooling my features. It was clear that the fates laughed at my paltry offering and chose to torture me instead.

He pulled an extra chair from a nearby table and held it open for her. She slipped into it, not bothering to adjust the bandana she called a skirt, before she sat. Aiden took the empty seat beside me.

"Hello everyone, it's nice of you to have me here," she addressed the table. Summer pinched my leg and it took everything in my power no to jump.

"Well, you weren't exactly invited," Scott, Aiden's father, mumbled into his glass of scotch. She ignored his comment and continued to beam at Elizabeth and Foster.

"It is a birthday celebration, so why not have a friend from school?" Aiden inquired, wearing his deceptive innocence like a well-tailored cloak. His eyes sparkled with malice as he pulled Lisa into his side; she giggled like an idiot. Summer and I sent each other wry looks. After what she and her evil Negaverse minions did to Summer, she was the last person I wanted to have anything to do with. Not here—not today of all days.

"I wasn't aware that you and Ms. Tremaine were friends, Blu," my father commented. One look in my direction and I knew he understood the truth. He'd always said that I was my mother's clone. I could fool the best of them but it was impossible to fool him.

"We do have most classes together; it's natural that we interact socially," I stated simply. I had to kick Summer to keep her from blurting something rude. Lisa beamed once again, completely missing the truth—not that it surprised me.

Dinner passed without any other major incident. The entire table, Aiden included, tried to hide their irritation when Lisa took fifteen minutes to order. She _needed_ to speak to the chef directly, to explain how her meal had to be cooked. We managed mundane conversation while we ate.

Mercifully, the cake was brought out signaling that we were near the end of this exhausting evening. Eighteen candles burned brightly atop the cake the waiters placed it in front of me. Everyone, save Aiden, clapped and sang. I blew out sixteen of the candles and the cake was sliced and served. I discreetly wiped away a delinquent tear.

"I thought you were eighteen?" Lisa asked, confused.

"She is," Aiden answered.

She turned to him, brows furrowed. Her fake boobs bunched and she faced him, threatening a wardrobe malfunction. "So why didn't she blow out the last two."

"Family tradition," Foster responded flatly. He always said that he had no use for useless people. Lisa huffed and crossed her arms over her ample chest.

"Well, I don't get it. That's a stupid waste of cake. Won't the wax get all over..." she trailed off as all eyes turned glacial on her and the air in the room turned arctic. Irritation and frustration, settled comfortably within my battered soul.

"Both of our mothers died on this day. We keep the center candles burning for them," I offered before chasing another delinquent tear with my napkin.

"How tragic," She whispered before continuing with her cake. Silence reigned for a few precious moments.

"Well," Elizabeth clapped her hands together, gaining all our attention. "I do believe that it is time to reveal our family gift to you." Foster slid a large manila envelope across the table. I merely stared at it.

"Really, it's a gift for both families." Foster smiled at me. He and Elizabeth had adopted me as one of their own for as long as I could remember. Elizabeth often complained to Scott that she always wanted a granddaughter.

I opened the envelope and examined the contents within. I steeled my features into a blank mask as rage and fury burned in a hot dance in the pit of my stomach. Aiden stiffened beside me as he read the documents over my shoulder. I took several deep breaths, before looking up to meet happy stares around the table.

"You're all serious?" Aiden and I asked incredulously.

"Remember when the two of you used to play together and Aiden said he would make you his wife and put flowers in your hair." Elizabeth remembered fondly. Those dreams were shattered with a bottle of rum and a ton and a half of metal three years ago.

"We were six!" Aiden spit out. The same rage the burned me alive spread to consume him.

"Well, it's time to let go of all the animosity, and heal," Foster said signaling for another brandy,

"I don't see what the difference is now," Elizabeth said sipping her coffee.

"We have grown up," he argued.

"Yes, you've graduated from giving her flowers, to buying her expensive lingerie," she said cheekily. Foster choked down drink as both of our fathers jumped up in protest. Flames of embarrassment bathed my face as the anger temporarily subsided.

"What is she talking about, Lucky?" My father questioned. He only called me that when he was angry. No one but Aiden usually called me by my first name—he did it just to piss me off.

"I'm sure this is my son's idea of a sick joke, Phillip." Scott jumped in.

"Oh stop it both of you," Elizabeth slammed her hand on the table and everyone jumped. Thankfully, Lisa remained quiet as her mouth hung open. "This solves everything."

"You have no choice but to go through with it now," Scott stated, my father nodded agreeing vehemently.

"And if I don't?" Aiden challenged.

"Repeat after me boy: _Would you like fries with that?_ " Foster gloated in response. I leaned back in my chair as Summer rubbed my arm. I suppose, in all the commotion she read the documents too. Cadence, my stepmother, and Elizabeth shared sweet smiles of glee.

"I don't understand, Aidy. Why are you buying her lingerie? And what is this gift everyone is talking about?" Lisa asked completely clueless.

He turned to me and smirked before answering. He knew that I'd be placed in the same position as him for refusing.

"I'm her present. Blu and I are getting married."
Chapter Six

To say that my birthday dinner was a success would be an utter lie. I only do that when it's necessary. Thank God that taking care of Remy had provided a temporary sanctuary when I caught his flu. I had been home for the last three days but my cell had been flooded with hate messages. _Fuck, time to change my number._ I slammed the phone down on the night stand and rolled over in bed. My entire body ached in spite of Letta Leigh's remedies. She suspected that it had more to do with my birthday present more than any virus.

Summer had continued to sing Aiden's praises; especially since he had been picking her up for school since I was sick. She bounced into my room, looking perky and cheerful as ever ranting on and on about how this war between Aiden and I is simply silly and that _I_ should let it go. Was she serious? Aiden had completely brain raped my sister! The mental stress of thinking of him added to the uncomfortable aches and pains that ravaged my body.

I pulled the thick comforter over my head and groaned as sunlight spontaneously spilled into the room. Pulsating pain, knock like an irritating solicitor against my skull. I was in too much pain to reach for my medication. " _Tatie_ , did you have to open the curtains?" I whispered harshly tucking the blanket around my head.

"The way you've been hiding out, no one would ever suspect that you are the same woman who threatened to tack my balls to the front of the school," I heard him pull up a chair and sit in it. A chill swept through me that had nothing to do with my flu.

"Keep it up, and when I'm able, I'll tie you down and pull out your pubes one by one with a pair of dull tweezers," I muttered miserably from under the blanket. He was the last person that I wanted to see me like this. I could deal with Aiden when I was prepared and had my armor up. But right now, I was weak and vulnerable.

"Can't I be here to nurse my fiancé back to health?" I could hear the smirk in his tone. _Yeah right._

"You'd be more likely to nurse me off of a cliff, Kevorkian," I spat and he chuckled but didn't disagree.

"My grandfather informed me that it was bad form for a man not to visit his ailing intended." I poked my head out from under the blankets to discover that he had pulled the curtains shut again.

"Trust me; I wouldn't have held a grudge." I struggled to sit up in the bed. The damn knocking that started in the back of my head moved around like a tidal wave and crashed hard behind my eyes. Bile and breakfast rolled in my stomach and surged up my throat.

I leaned over the bed hoping I didn't miss the can and let the good times roll. Either my fever caused extreme hallucinations or Aiden held my hair out of the way and rubbed my back. Spikes of pleasure danced along my nerve endings. I was sick in more ways than one. How in the hell was I getting turned on while tossing my cookies?

Wiping my mouth with the cloth from the night stand, I sat back against the barrage of pillows while I waited for the party in my stomach to subside. A few deep breaths, later I chanced a glance at Aiden who quietly emptied out the can in the bathroom and returned with a glass of water and my pills. I whispered a thanks and he sat back down and watched me.

Traitorous tears welled up behind my closed lids and I swallowed the lump of emotion that threatened to choke me. My life had been taken from me and bound to his five days ago when we signed the documents agreeing to go through with the betrothal.

" _What the fuck did you do?" He growled as he followed me into the women's bathroom and locked the door after making sure it was clear of anyone else._

" _What do you mean, what_ _I_ _did? I don't give you lingerie for your birthday," I yelled back at him. How the hell was he blaming me for this? "As I recall, you're the one going around blasting my family every chance you get." I jammed my finger into his chest. Pushing away from him, I took a few deep breaths trying to calm the bullet train in my chest._

" _For all I know, you went complaining to my grandparents and begged for them to force me to honor whatever virtue you have left." he spat out angrily. Cold waves of shock doused me...frozen shards of hatred chilled my spine and stilled my battered heart for a beat._

Before I could control any wild impulses dancing within me, my palm connected with his cheek. I glared at him and tried to ignore the stinging in my palm. "You think I would marry you when there are plenty of men out there who would not only treat me better, but could probably satisfy me better than you?" I retorted maliciously. Yeah, it was a bold fucking face lie. I already said that the fates hated me. Damn bitches were evil enough to make sure that no other man would make me feel what Aiden did. Beauty of it is, he didn't have to know that.

His eyes turned to stone as he snaked his arm around my waist and pulled me tight against his body. His erection pressed into my stomach and his lips crashed down onto mine. He nipped and tasted every bit of my mouth. My heart beat a heavy rhythm against my ribs. Ecstasy flooded the channel between my thighs when his tongue slid against mine. Suddenly, he let me go and looked as if he had just completed the mundane task of tying his shoes. I took several shaky steps toward the sinks.

" _See if your precious Remy can do that," he said with a smirk._

" _Fuck you."_

" _It looks like we don't have a choice but to save that for the wedding night, dear," he tossed over his shoulder before leaving me, still shaken, in the bathroom._

He was right. We didn't have a choice. Aiden refused to be reduced to flipping burgers and I was desperate to go to Duke. If we had disagreed, then our families had no qualms about pulling our futures out from under us.

"I didn't know you were still getting migraines," his words were so low; I barely heard them beyond the pounding between my ears.

"Not something I go around advertising," I said failing to get comfortable. The congestion in my chest was making it hard to breathe. I reached for the jar of vapor rub on the night stand and rubbed the oil mixture on my chest. Aiden took the container from me and pushed the back of my shirt up.

"You don't have to..."

"Shut up, I'm already here." He rubbed it into my back and I could already feel the cloud in my chest breaking up, allowing easier passage of oxygen.

"Thank you." He just grunted in response and cleaned his hands with a sanitizing wipe. He bent over and handed me a thick folder. Inside were the documents from several student committees that I was a part of. It also had all the work I had missed for today. I know that I mentally bitched about getting the caring Aiden back constantly, but I didn't know how to deal with it, apparently. I didn't have the heart to tell him that Remy had promised to bring all of them to me.

"You don't have to stare at me like that. I'm still human." He rolled his eyes at me and examined his nails.

"Barely," it slipped. I hadn't meant to antagonize him since he had been so nice. I said I didn't know how to deal with this Aiden. To my surprise he laughed and it warmed the coldest part of me.

"Well, can't say this has been less than pleasing, but I have to get going. Lisa is expecting me for the rehearsal dance." The cotillion was a week away and Aiden was her escort. I suppressed the urge to gag.

"Care not to compound my migraine by mentioning her name?" Apparently, people in hell finally got ice water because he laughed again and there was nothing condescending about it. He gathered his bag and was ready to walk out the door when Remy walked in. The chill returned to the room. Or was that the fever? Either way, they stared each other down.

"She's spoken for," Aiden declared. It was like watching two wolves trying to establish dominance. Remy cocked a brow at him and leaned against the door frame.

"My mouth has gotten a little dry from all the talking," he casually tossed back. Aiden clenched his hands and gritted his teeth.

"Either piss on the furniture or take it outside. Whatever shuts you the hell up; I don't have the willpower to deal with this today and my meds haven't kicked in yet," I complained turning my back on both of them and pulling the comforter back over my head.

Aiden's angry gait carried down the hall as I caught a whiff of Remy's cologne nearby.

"Are you sure you want to marry him?"

"I can deal with him, Jeremy. What I don't need is the two of you battling it out like some oversized and highly overrated gladiators." I knew I was whining; Remy was just trying to be noble. The whole, defending my honor and all, but there was nothing he could do to stop this.

"Oversized gladiator, huh?" He joked. I turned to see him flexing his muscles in the mirror. He took great pride in keeping his body in pristine shape. "You only keep me around as eye candy. I knew it."

I tossed a pillow at him, it barely made it halfway and he burst out laughing. Depositing his tall form into the chair Aiden vacated, he picked up the pillow and put it back on the bed.

"I also said overrated." His face crumpled into an adorable frown as he feigned hurt.

"You're vicious, but I love it!" He squealed. I shook my head slowly and rolled my eyes. This is what was so great about him. He was like Prince Charming and Cinderella all in one! OMG! Even better, he was one of the Starlights! Thank you, Naoko Takeuchi, for expanding my imagination into the world of anime and gifting me (and the rest of the world) with Sailor Moon.

"So, he brought your work."

"Yeah." Remy made a face I couldn't quite decipher so I ignored it.

"So when's the big day?" He crossed his ankles and lounged back, flipping through one of the many magazines Summer brought in for me.

"Doom's day is scheduled for May tenth; the Saturday after graduation."

"Aren't we leaving on the thirteenth?" Remy and I had decided to attend a summer finance program for freshman. Our Orientation was set for the fifteenth of May. Classes started that following Monday and would carry on through the first week of August.

"And your point would be?" Remy nearly fell out of his chair as amusement consumed him. My composure gave way and I joined him in the laughter.

"Well, I don't see him putting up a fuss. Glad to be rid of you?"

"No fuss, because I didn't tell him yet." Remy stilled in the chair.

"What do you mean you didn't tell him yet?" He asked slowly.

"Like I said, it wasn't his business then, it isn't now." I sat up crossing my arms over my chest. I knew I looked like a brat, but I was entitled, wasn't I?

" _Cherie_ , I may not like him, or know your situation very well. But I'm pretty sure a man would want to know if his wife is going to leave him three days after they're married." He reasoned seriously. In our brief time together, I had only seen Remy get serious a few times. I knew marriage was important to him, coerced or otherwise.

"I'll tell him," I replied carefully.

"Before or after you've packed to leave."He quirked a brow up at me.

"Before," I confirmed. He stared at me a moment longer before dismissing it with a wave of his hand. That's what I loved about him. He didn't pry....too much.

"That's a relief, because I was really starting to believe I was wrong about you."Adric leaned his tall frame against the door. I rolled my eyes and burrowed down further into my pillows. Adric gave Remy a man shake and took a seat on the chaise in the sitting area across from my bed. Remy may not have pried but Adric would. He would pry and that traitor Remy would let him.

"How the hell do you know?" I knew the answer to that. He just quirked a knowing brow at me. The Wainwright, Moon, and Abington estates all shared a common property line. We also shared workers. Of course word got back to them. I also wouldn't put it past Aiden. Well really, I wouldn't put a piece of lint past Aiden either.

"You don't really think that he would agree to let Remy be his best man would you? No offense," he leaned back in the lounge chair and propped his feet up on the table. At least he always had the decency to take his shoes off first.

"None taken," he smiled cheekily. Adric and Remy had along instantly; mainly because Adric was never in a rush to judge.

"Besides, the headmaster wrote letters of recommendation for both you and Aiden," he sighed as if he was bored with the entire situation. "I thought it funny when my uncle asked how Aiden was taking the news that you'd be separated so soon after your impending nuptials." I did the only thing I could at the moment. I stuck my tongue out at him and they laughed. Of course information had gotten back to Adric. I was stupid and careless and I should have known better.

"I have been pestering her to tell him for some time now," Remy flipped through the pages of a small paperback book. He always carried one with him.

"Not the way to convince that one to do anything," they carried on like I wasn't even in the room and it was starting to chafe on my last nerves.

"I realize that now," Remy flipped another page. Adric picked imaginary dirt from under his nails.

"Excuse me, sick person in the room," I waved my arms despite my body aches.

"Shush dear, adults are having conversation," Adric dismissed me, not bothering to look in my direction.

"Screw both of you with a bent and jagged stick," I muttered under my breath. Adric laughed aloud. I knew what they were trying to do. I wasn't being fair to Aiden. But when was he ever fair to me?

"Look who is being loquacious," Adric chuckled and I failed at throwing a pillow at him too. Remy joined in the laughter this time.

"I get it Cheech and Chong," I was superficially angry at them for pushing my buttons. I also understood, begrudgingly that it was necessary. Adric immediately sobered up and stood, "See that you do." He left and I suddenly felt lower than snake piss.
Chapter Seven

After the long night of hacking coughs, tummy parties, and oil/vapor rub mixtures I was feeling back to my normal self and ready for school again. It was Thursday, and it was time to finalize the plans for the dance. At Abington, the collective reasoning was that we were above having regular proms. Instead, every year, we had a cotillion for the graduation class. Family and friends alike were invited to witness the presentation of the new generation into adulthood.

I ran the flat iron through my hair one last time, trying desperately to claim the frizz and curls that claimed my hair over the past few days. My hair flowed around my shoulders in soft waves. There was no way I was getting my hair straight today. Three days of just showering and getting back into bed, had not been conducive in keeping my hair straight—it was a cross between Scary Spice and Macy Gray. It would take a miracle or a salon appointment to have it where I wanted it. Since I had time for neither, I just slapped on a hairband and jacket and headed down to the kitchen.

Summer's voice rang loudly in my ear as she pranced around the kitchen. Obviously Vincent had been by because I could smell the freshly made avocado lime cream cheese that he knew I loved. Unfortunately, that joy was spoiled by the sight of Aiden...obviously the source of Summer's joy this morning.

"Obviously, I'm going to school this morning. So why are you here?" I asked grabbing a bagel and spreading the much coveted cream on it. I took a bite and stared openly at Aiden. His face was a combination of soft and hard. In middle school, I used to call him manga boy. He looked like one of the overly cute, kind of feminine guys in the Japanese graphic novels. Aiden never let that usurp his masculinity though.

"I know," he responded curtly, taking a sip of his coffee. He drank it like I did, black.

"So..." I dragged on, waiting for more of a response.

"I was informed this morning that I needed a sample of the lace pattern of your dress to have my pocket square redone."

"I haven't gone wedding dress shopping yet," I informed him, finishing off my bagel and strawberry lemonade.

"He means for the cotillion," Summer chirped in a singsong voice. I was dumbfounded; Remy was my escort.

"I already had a talk with Fontaine and he has already found someone else to slob over for the night," Aiden provided when I still failed to put the right words to voice. Summer burst out with laughter as she clapped her hands. Naturally, she would be there considering she was family, but also as an underclassmen, she would be a part of the wait staff.

"When were you going to tell me this?" I finally managed to spit out, dislodging the anger that was lodged in my throat.

"I just did."

"The cotillion is a week away and you're telling me now?" I yelled. Cadence chose that moment to come in with a sample swatch of lace from my dress and handed it to Aiden.

"Here you go sweetheart," she smiled prettily at him. Cadence was a beautiful woman who could have passed more for a sister than the mother of a hormonal fourteen year old girl. She'd had Summer at a young age and had worked her way through high school and college after her parents disowned her. She married my dad three years ago, after Aiden's mom passed away. Even after all that went on she still stood by daddy. How could I not love her? Her short bob was styled in a burst of curls that framed her heart shaped face. She poured herself a cup of tea and giggled with Summer as they watched us like a pair of Gilmore girls.

"Thank you Cadence," he did that charming smile thing that made me want to pull out his teeth one by one with a pair of rusty old pliers. I swear I never had violent thoughts like this unless it was somehow linked to this idiot. He put the swatch in his pocket and grabbed my bag.

"I think we should get going, Lucky." He offered me his arm but I ignored it, trying to grab the bag that he held out of my reach. It didn't help that at six feet and four inches, he as almost a foot taller than me.

"What the hell are you doing Aiden?" I stomped my foot like a child.

"I'm taking my fiancé to school," he winked at Cadence and Summer, and I swear I could see the steam coming from their melted hearts. Suddenly, there was an impromptu rave in my stomach.

"You do realize I have a car right?" _Who the fuck was I kidding? I loved the hell out of that McLaren!_ I just wished it didn't have to come with a side of Aiden.

"Honey, don't you remember that your father dropped your car off for servicing, yesterday afternoon," Cadence took too much delight in telling me. She was what I referred to as a fairy chasing bohemian chic hippie. When it mattered, she knew how to dress it up. Around the house, she broke out her old clothes and turned into a free-love, peacekeeping hippie. She was always against the feud between Aiden and me, but never said anything about. Rather, she outwardly promoted peace and harmony any time we got together.

"Isn't it sweet of him to offer you a ride?" Cadence was going out to bad for him **hard**. I think it had more to do with her _willful_ discussion with my dad following my birthday dinner disaster. She always said that they didn't argue. They both had strong wills and just liked to have their point heard. It was why she made such a great nurse; she could bend the will of the most difficult patients.

"I wasn't offering. I'm taking her to school and that's final." I could see the vacant look behind the charm. Aiden knew damn well we had plenty of cars in the garage for me to choose from. He was here to do damage control. My birthday dinner was on a Friday, giving him the weekend to mull things over. But since I had gotten sick and wasn't in school, we had no time to discuss our plan of attack. As much as I hated it, it was a smart move...not that I'd ever tell him that.

"The McLaren only seats two people," I reminded him hoping to wipe the smirk of satisfaction from his perfect face.

"I'll be taking Summer to school today since you have early meetings this morning," Cadence happily chirped. She just fed his satisfaction a full serving of Mega-Ego Boost Alpha 12. I rolled my eyes as I shrugged on my blazer and walked past him and out the front door. It would be pointless to argue with him any further. My stepmother had been prepared to take his side no matter what. Where was the sense of family loyalty?

I tried to maintain the dignity that I was brought up with. I was a Moon—a descendent of African Queens and a member of one of the oldest wealthy black families in America. I absolutely refused to act like a petulant child.

"You're pouting," Aiden pointed out with a laugh.

"So?" He laughed again. The steam built up in my head and threatened to leak from my ears. You know that cartoon bull that's always pissed.

He started the car and sped off towards school. "I did call you to try and give you a heads up this morning but your number's disconnected. The news has already spread around school."

"Given all of the hate messages I got over the past few days that would be a severe understatement. I had to change my number," I let him know, staring out the window. I watched as we sped by all the sprawling properties and into town.

"Summer gave me your number before you came down." He didn't attempt to apologize for the hate messages. Why would he? He would say that I deserved it for ruining his life.

"It's only going to get worse once we get to campus. It was suggested by the higher ups that we go to school together; some archaic, fanciful notion of presenting a united front," he said bitterly—the sarcasm dripping from his lips.

"What an obedient boy," I mocked, but didn't chance staring at him. I was a hypocrite and I refused to face his accusing stare. Halfway through town, he cut up a side street that led out to the country roads.

"It's not like you have a choice in the matter either," he finally acknowledged. "Just because you didn't arrange this doesn't mean your father isn't somehow responsible for this too." And that was the sound of the other bitter stiletto dropping.

"Did you miss the part where this was supposed to be some plan cooked up by your grandmother?" He swung onto the country road, surrounded by vast fields and picturesque mountains in the distance.

"Don't expect me to change just because we're engaged. Taking you to the cotillion means nothing. I am still the heir to the Wainwright fortune. Socially, it makes sense to be your escort," he completely ignored my question, as usual. I nodded, taking in the view.

The car was silent for a few moments before Aiden abruptly pulled over and parked the car. I stared at him, wondering what he was thinking.  
"You kicked me out of your room yesterday," he said evenly—clearly Aiden wasn't happy.

"As I recall, I told you both to take it outside, if you couldn't keep from pissing on my rug," I shrugged my shoulders, deciding to close my eyes and revel in the soft red leather.

"You called me an overrated gladiator."

"You were acting more like a pig."

"He didn't leave until late."

"That's called stalking. Besides, Adric was there too."

"Summer volunteered that information."

"Talk about family loyalty."

"Now you know how I feel," he said quietly. I opened an eye to stare at him again. He sat back in his seat and dragged a hand through his inky curls. He turned his heated gaze on me.

One hand trailed up my thigh and mini curls of pleasure shot up my leg and coiled in my center. I closed my eyes and took in a deep breath.

"Things aren't going to change, just because we're getting married," his hand tightened beneath the hem of my skirt and my pulse jumped. His words sunk in and I pushed his hand away tightening my grasp on reality.

"I didn't expect you to change at all," I said tightly. Marriage wasn't taken lightly in our circles. One would think that race would be an issue to. But if you hadn't noticed yet, beyond breading, money is the one thing that transcends almost all of life's trivial obstacles. Respect is earned in every direction as long as your paper trail is long enough.

However, the one thing money couldn't surpass were the sacred vows as old as time. Of course, affairs came natural in a world with money as old as ours. Keeping them a secret proved to be the hardest thing. Aiden, I suspected, had no intention of keeping them secret—he didn't now, anyways. We came to a quiet understanding and Aiden restarted the car and sped off towards school.

Every pair of early eyes at Abington turned on us as we pulled into the lot. We made a quick stop at my locker then proceeded to our morning meetings, avoiding awkward stares and reciprocating even more awkward greetings. I felt the sharp stares of every envious woman within a three mile radius pierce the skin in my back and twist slowly. To his credit, Aiden hung closely, even occasionally participated in a few intimate touches, when the stares got too unbearable. A few bold classmates stiffly congratulated us on our upcoming nuptials.

Following the meetings, he walked me to my locker before abandoning me for his friends and moving to their usual spot further down the hall. It was still early, another half hour before the bell rang for opening period. Remy strolled up with his easy gait and lazy grin.

"The new power couple stirring up trouble on the social scene, I see." His grin spread wider across his lips.

"Sorry about the cotillion. It appears it's out of my hands," I apologized lamely. I pulled out a couple of folders and binders I would need for my classes. I had qualified to opt out of my final exams and would be handing in my final projects today. The work that Aiden brought me corrected the final corrections I had needed to make.

" _Pas de quoi,"_ he shrugged pushing off the lockers and winking at a couple of giggling girls that walked by. He definitely wouldn't be hurting for my company that night.

"I'd had my eye on Clarette Douser for the past few days anyway."

"Just Clarette, or her twin brother as well?" His grin grew wider. Suddenly, my body propelled forward. Remy's arms shot out to steady me. I looked over my shoulder to find Lisa and her surgically enhanced groupies.

"I would apologize, but then that would be pointless," she laughed grating on my nerves and eardrums simultaneously. I had to admit that she was the only person that could accomplish that feat. I suppose that makes her rather talented.

"No need to be petty," Remy stepped in. "Clearly, the better woman won."

She narrowed her eyes at Remy and her talons showed. "Only because, apparently, he'd been tipping the cow," she cackled and her cronies joined in. Such miserable birds deserved to be put out of their misery.....wait a minute, did that bitch just call me a cow?

"He didn't have to agree if he felt that strongly about it. Besides, what does that say about the quality of your milk, dear? Everyone knows he'd been sampling it for free for quite some time now. Was there an offer on the table for more permanent delivery arrangements?" Remy queried sarcastically. _GO REMY!!R-E-M-Y!! GOOOOO REMY!_ I cheered mentally. Another reason I loved him so much is how great he was with words. The way he waxed poetic was downright lyrical genius. His sarcasm and flare for imagery were simply epic.

Lisa's mouth opened and closed in rapid succession like a fish on dry land gasping for air. I didn't that tried hard to suppress the laughter bubbling in me.

"I'm sure he would have gotten around to it," insignificant groupie number one shot back, while insignificant groupie number two nodded dumbly.

"No, I wouldn't have," Aiden said as he walked by, slipping an arm around Lisa's tiny waist and dragging her way. Her groupies struggled to catch up and blend in with his entourage. He shot me a quick look that dared me to say anything to him. We weren't married yet, so vows didn't apply. We weren't even dating.

"I would commend him on his save, but I'm not quite sure who he was saving," Remy mused aloud as the hall buzzed with gossip and excitement over what just transpired.

"I already have a knight in shining armor," I smiled as I wrapped my arm around his. He kissed the top of my head and we continued on to our first class.

"Are you sure you want to do this?"

"Nothing in my shoe collection matches the uniforms of fast food fashion," I wrinkled my nose. I got chills picturing my Jimmy Choo's stepping in fry cook's grease.

"Touché."

Chapter Eight

May 31, 2003

Letta Leigh slipped the last pin in place securing the network of twists and braids at the back of my head. Loose tendrils of hair framed my face. Cadence finished the last application of lip gloss before stepping back and allowing me to see her work. I smiled and thanked her and Letta Leigh. Their eyes shone with fresh happy tears as they watched me in the mirror.

"I swear I'm blowing this joint if you two start crying," I warned them. They laughed and wiped errant tears with their napkins.

"We had better get downstairs. Your father and Andre are waiting for us." Letta Leigh and Cadence hugged me quickly before exiting the room.

Layers of white lace, taffeta, and satin surrounded me as girls squealed and chatted animatedly while waiting for the signal to take the stairs. Standing up, I pushed away from the vanity and straightened my white dress. It was previously my mother's dress. Her parents were downstairs with my family waiting for my presentation to the world. I hardly ever saw the Corbetts—I think they blamed me for her death as well. I ran my hand over the fitted strapless bodice. The corset style bodice was overlain with intricate lace patterns and pearls. The simple bubble pickup skirt was inset with deep lace appliqués and sequins.

Across the room, girls fawned over Lisa's gown—it was a bit risqué. The white bodice was see-through with gold stitching; the full tulle skirt was decked out in crystals and sequins. Clouds of white surrounded me as I received random compliments on my dress. The school secretary poked her head through the door to warn us to get in order. We were to meet our escorts at the top of the grand staircase. After our names were announced, we'd descend onto the dance floor to perform the choreographed dance.

One by one the girls in front of me smiled brightly and met their escorts. Remy winked at me before offering Clarrette his arm and escorted her down the stairs. By the time I moved to the top of the stairs a wave of butterflies danced in my belly.

"Master Aiden Foster Wainwright and Lady Lucky Blu Moon," the announcer called into the microphone. Aiden bowed low at the waist and kissed my palm before tucking it in his arm. Cheers rang out from the crowd as we descended the marble staircase. We took our place on the floor and waited while the rest of our classmates were announced. I studied Aiden discreetly. Why men like him didn't come with warning labels was beyond me. His classic black tuxedo was custom tailored to fit his muscular swimmer's build. Talk about a hazard to my sexual health.

"You're staring," the side of his mouth kicked up in a ghost of a smile. I quickly averted my gaze, concentrating on the announcer calling the last couple to the floor. He had blown out his hair causing his bangs to fall into his eyes. He looked every bit the part of some anime dreamboat.

His arm took my waist and we moved silently through the waltz. Only the boys and girls who ranked top fifty in the class took part in the dance. After the first dance, other couples were welcomed to join. I was desperate to get out of the room. The fragile truce between Aiden and I was bound end at any moment now and I didn't want it happening here. Sensing my distress, Aiden escorted me through the double doors that led to the terrace overlooking the botanical gardens below.

"Didn't want the world to know how badly you wanted me?" he asked snidely. I sucked my teeth at him.

"That was rude," he leaned against the balcony railing, the light from the new moon washing over him surrounding him with its ethereal glow.

"Your mother's dress looks good on you." I had to be imagining things. Maybe the concoctions that Letta Leigh fed me while I was sick were finally taking their toll on my brain cells.

"Thank you," I managed without insulting him.

"I noticed the Corbetts are here." He knew that my mother's parents rarely came around unless it was for a major event. The last time I saw them was for Allison Wainwright's funeral. It wasn't that we didn't get along or that they didn't like us; they were just old. Their permanent residence in Hartford, Connecticut made travel a little difficult to Bettingford Abbey, Virginia. The closest major airport was in Richmond about fifty miles north, so they had to hire a driver to bring them into town.

"Grandfather was cleared for flight so they were able to come," I shrugged. Just because there was no outward animosity, didn't mean I didn't notice the temperature drop every time they noticed me in the room. Like I said, I think they still blame me for mom.

"Have you finalized the arrangements for the move?" I didn't have to ask him what he meant. My refusal to transfer to UPENN had been a point of contention between us for the past week. I walked out on him when he refused to back down. It was impossible trying to reason with a selectively deaf, spoiled boar. He seriously expected me to drop all of my plans to follow him like one of Lisa's mindless groupies. He wasn't even registered to start until the fall semester.

I had done what Adric and Remy wanted. I told Aiden, but he refused to listen to reason. He insisted that it didn't make sense for us to separate. But I craved it as much as I did him. I needed the space. It was a prerequisite to my sanity.

"Everything has been finalized already," I didn't offer any more information. He nodded briefly then offered me his arm again. "Let's head back before my grandmother finds a reason to speed up the wedding." I took his arm and smiled inwardly. It was about time he had acknowledged his grandmother as the ringleader behind this scheme.

We made our way to our parents, stopping to greet other families along the way and accepting their congratulations on our engagement. We smiled politely until we reached our table. Liz hugged me tightly followed by Joshua.

"You look just like your mother," Calvin Corbett kissed my cheek. I smiled shyly. I didn't know why, but whenever someone mentioned that I looked like my mom, feelings of guilt flooded me. Regina Corbett patted my cheek but stayed silent. She held the crystal tears that gathered in her eyes in check. My grandmother had designed this dress for my mother. The gamut of emotions that ran through us both kept sufficient words out of our reach.

Thankfully, Dean Forrester had several announcements to make, saving us from anymore awkward moments. I spied Scott Wainwright and his parents taking the stage and turned a confused glare at Aiden. He shrugged carelessly but the locking of his jaw belied his calm. My head spun with a multitude of scenarios.

"Tonight, we welcome the future of our families into our folds. We've molded them, educated them and pray that they make us proud. Tonight, I am proud to announce that my son is taking the first step in the direction of making his family proud." He smiled wide into the microphone and my heart rate kicked up an extra fourteen beats per minute. Aiden's hand tightened around mine. The stillness in his hand and the feigned warmth in his eyes never changed. He smiled brightly back at his father, but even that shine wasn't enough to illuminate the darkest parts of his soul.

"Most of you know the history between the Wainwright and Moon families. What started almost four centuries ago finally comes full circle." The Wainwright legacy, in America, started when the second son, Turner Wainwright, took his share of his inheritance and bought passage over to the colonies. He desperately sought to expand his family's holdings in the jewelry making in the New World. However, his family disowned him for his forward thinking.

Fortunately for him, he was able to flip them the long distance bird when he discovered the first gold mine in Virginia two centuries before Thomas Jefferson's notes revealed. Turner traded some of the gold to a Dutchman for a Black man brought over from Africa. Turner—never in favor of slavery, taught him to keep books. He married a local Native American woman and adopted her last name, Moon. That time had sealed the fate of the Wainwright and Moon families. Scott was right, it was all coming full circle now and I was a slave to Aiden's will.

"I am more than proud to announce, that in just two weeks my son, Aiden, will be taking Ms. Moon as his wife." He lifted his glass in the air and the entire room followed suit, "To the past and the present converging to secure a brighter future."

The room rang full of cheers and applauds of approval. My heart thundered in my ears as lunch threatened to make a second appearance. I smiled demurely and turned into Aiden's arms to find temporary relief from the attention. A spotlight spotted us as the cheers rang louder. Aiden pulled me into his side and wrapped his arm around me.

I'd only had a few moments to speak to Remy. Between all of the well-wishers and Clarette hanging onto him for dear life, we barely had time to spare for each other but promised we would catch up tomorrow. Making my way through the ballroom I veered off in the direction of the bathrooms. I ducked behind a pillar when I heard Lisa and Aiden's voices.

"I don't believe that you're actually going through with this."

"Calm down."

"Why the hell should I calm down?" she raged on, swinging her curls out her face. Her cheeks flush with fury and embarrassment, she continued her mad tirade.

"You are seriously considering marrying _her?"_ The way she said it slapped with the urge to check under my nails for nonexistent caked dirt.

"There is nothing to consider. What's done is done," Aiden replied with finality. He leaned against the opposite side of the pillar I hid behind. I held my breath.

"What if she gets pregnant? The whole world already knows your screwing her perfect little brains out." Lisa whined and stomped her foot. I winced feeling sympathy for her foot in the expensive sling-back shoes she wore... a size too small at that.

"Then I won't be married long." I could hear the smirk in his voice. "It's only fitting don't you think? Murder runs in her family. Her father killed my mom. Look what she did to her mother, and the poor woman was just trying to give birth. It's only fitting she'd go in childbirth as well." Lisa and I shared a gasp. Slowly I emerged from the behind the pillar. My chest rose and fell painfully as I sucked in vast amounts of air on shaky legs.

Two things echoed between the three of us: the resounding sound of palm connecting with his cheek and the sound of my quickly retreating steps.

Bile rose in my throat as I struggled for breath and fought the onslaught of tears. I stumbled past the vast ballroom of cheerful celebrants onto the empty terrace. I couldn't fight it anymore. I found the nearest shrub with the most beautiful violets and got up close and personal with my gastric juices.

"Classy." A gloved hand a sarcastic sneer appeared to my left. Relief flooded through me when I turned to find Adric handing me his handkerchief. I wiped my mouth and blew my nose loudly. He clicked his tongue, pretending to be annoyed.

"You still plan on going through with it? Even after that?" Of course he knew how Aiden felt. He was his best friend.

I stood up and straightened my dress. Heat flushed my cheeks and my heart still thundered in my chest. It was impossible to compose myself quickly, no matter my breeding. My heart, whatever was left of it, had shriveled and was slowly breaking off in tiny pieces as a frosty chill passed through me.

"I don't have a choice." It hurt like hell. Defeat was difficult to admit, but I'd been emotionally battered into submission.

Adric sat regally on a stone bench. It was akin to watching and old world lord in his manor. His custom three piece tuxedo clung to his solid frame. I let out a heavy breath and wearily sat next to him.

"You refuse to make a choice. There's a difference," he cast me a sideways glance. He picked a stray leaf out of my hair. "You don't want to make a choice because you are afraid of what it will cost you and I don't mean your trust fund." To call Adric subtle would be like calling the Statue of Liberty a figurine.

I squared my shoulders and pulled my head out of my emotional ass. "I have obligations and a duty to our families. I will not humiliate us by reneging." My voice was stronger now and held the confidence befitting my station.

Adric stood and offered me his arm. A small part of me warned me of the truth that rang in his words but I pushed them aside. I took his proffered hand and fixed a demure smile on my lips, determination lining my nerves.

He bowed gallantly over my hand and grinned mischievously, "Spoken like the true elitist after my own heart."
Chapter Nine

Tap, tap, pop. Tap, tap, pop. The heavyweight bag in the full sized gym swayed under the force of my blows. Jab, jab, then hard cross. Rivers of sweat poured down my back, drenching my sports bra. My muscles threatened to cramp in protest but I kept swinging away. The dull green bag reminded of his eyes. I punched harder.

His cruel words played in my head on repeat. Unshed tears burned my eyes as they mixed with sweat but I refused to let them fall. I couldn't let them fall. I tightened my grip and punched harder. Oxygen struggled to find its way into my lungs as I dragged in deep labored breaths. A desperate, agonizing sob escaped me before I clung to the bag and crumbled under the weight of my hurt.

"You could always marry me," Adric pushed off the doorframe at the entrance of the gym and sauntered casually over. This was the last thing I needed. He wore a pair of old sweats and an Abington Athletics t-shirt. He looked delectable. The short sleeves hugged his biceps nicely. Why couldn't I want him?

I sniffled and wiped my face with the sweat towel I had tucked in the back of my shorts.

"I mean it's definitely as good a match as you and Aiden. We are fairly attracted to each other. Not even _my_ parents could protest it." Adric's parents were highly critical of anyone he brought home. I was the only girl they ever really approved of.

Race didn't typically mean anything in our circles, but his mother's family originated from the Deep South. Her family was from the deepest part of the south that believed that it was only a matter of time before the confederacy would rise again.

My breeding was the only reason I was acceptable in her eyes. Dr. Abington only scoffed for the first five minutes when she learned that I was Adric's date for the winter ball this past December. It was also the reason, Adric dated girls of every race that he could manage. He found his mother's ignorance perturbing and disgusting. As a daughter-in-law, I'd be a constant thorn in her side and we both knew it.

I found his attempt to make me feel better amusing so I laughed. It was the first genuine one in more than a week. I'd been so lost in all of the plans for the wedding that I'd barely had time to breathe. Liz, Letta Leigh, and Cadence descended upon my like a Tribunal of Fluff and Circumstance.

"I appreciate the gesture Adric and no offense, but I'd be trading one headache for another," I finally answered between gasps for air and deep swigs of cold water. I sat on the mat and Adric joined me. I pulled off the fingerless gloves and inspected the bruising around my knuckles.

He took my hands in his and released a disgusted snort, "That's going to look great in the wedding photos." I sneered at him and pulled my hands away.

"They'll heal in time." I proceeded to stretch knowing that nothing was going to ease my muscles but an ice bath and a warm bed.

I didn't want to think about my fast approaching doomsday. Everyone was buzzing happily about the details, seemingly unaware of my misery. I zoned out during the meetings and could think of nothing more than getting away. It was really the only comfort I found, other than Remy and Adric.

"Out with it Yoda," I sneered at Adric but didn't stop stretching. Thankfully, he didn't pretend like he didn't know what I was talking about. "I wouldn't be upset if you married me and decided to go to Duke. I'd be just right down the road, after all." Adric leaned forward and grabbed my hands pulling me towards him. I breathed into the stretch and exhaled slowly.

Cocking a brow at him, "And marry Tarheel? I'd rather have Aiden." I shivered in mock disgust and pulled back. Adric laughed and I couldn't help but join him.

Aiden was still on the UPenn kick but I wasn't having any of it. I figured the best way to deal with him was just to give him non-answers. I didn't feel like lying to him, so I danced around his questions instead. I'd become quite adept at it.

"You have to had been a ninja in a past life, for all your sneaking up on me," I changed the subject unwilling to sit on the receiving end of another of Adric's great lectures. He had a way of making me want to burrow into the ground.

He grinned and winked at me, "Ninjas are so much cooler than gladiators." I expelled the breath I was holding. He would let it go.

My own smile faltered when I say Aiden come through the door. "Be it gladiators or ninjas, it seems you always have men willing to fight for you." To anyone else, his tone was amusingly light, but we knew better.

Adric stood and offered me his hand, but Aiden quickly intercepted my hand and squeezed it tightly. I tried to pull my aching fingers out of his bruising grip, but he wouldn't let go. Adric gave a lazy smile and shrugged his shoulders, "She is quite the specimen. Any man would be willing to go to war for her." He winked at me again and looked me over. I couldn't help the genuine flush that came over me. Suddenly, I felt self-conscious in my black spandex shorts and white cut off tank. I was sweat drenched and completely flustered under Adric's heated stare.

Aiden frowned and stepped in front of me. "I wasn't aware my best friend considered himself just _any_ man," he snidely tossed back.

"I'm an Abington. We don't breed just **any** man," his stare finally drifted away and he waved Aiden off dismissively. The grip around my fingers lightened, mercifully. I was finally able to pull my hand free.

"Put your cocks away," I grabbed a towel off a nearby weight bench and wiped off the sweat that dipped into my sports bra. "What do you want, Aiden?"

"We have lunch scheduled with both of our grandparents." I hadn't forgotten. My grandparents had decided to stay until after the wedding. The women of the Wainwright and Moon households were delightfully drowning in wedding details.

"That's not for another couple of hours," I discarded the towel in the laundry bin. "Adric was keeping me company after my workout."

"Your mother wants you," we all knew it for the lie that it was but Adric had sense enough not to fight it. Aiden was in one of his moves. "Think about my offer," Adric just had to toss in before he left. I shook my head and just smiled on my way to the shower. The gym housed three luxurious spa bathrooms. I peeled off my sweaty clothes knowing that Aiden followed.

There was a heaviness in my breasts and a pulsing between my thighs that wouldn't go away ever since he arrived. He did this to me. He did this and I hated it. But there was no denying it. It was physically impossible. I felt his eyes on me, branding me.

"His offer?" I turned on the steam shower and pulled my hair out of the tie. It was starting to curl up and it smelled like my sweat and conditioner. I refused to turn around. It would be my undoing. Rather, I busied myself with gathering things to wash my hair and soap from under the sink.

In the large mirror, I saw him take seat. He was wearing a light blue dress shirt and grey slacks. His hair casually fell over his forehead. I wanted to kick him when he licked his lips. My stomach clenched in anticipation. I was never self-conscious about being naked around him. It was intoxicating knowing the physical effect I had on him. It made me feel like I had some sense of control in the life of submission I was forced into.

"He offered his hand in marriage instead," I bent over to retrieve a bath sponge from under the sink. His eyes moved from my ass to mine in the mirror and he swallowed hard. Aiden looked away first before scoffing. "His mother would give you hell."

"I told him you were the lesser of two evils, although I'm not so sure now." He met my stare again with his own glare. He unfolded his tall frame from the chair and slowly stalked over to me.

Air caught in my throat when he pressed his body against my back, forcing me against the sink. I felt every hard line of his body. His hand snaked around my waist, touching lightly before dipping between my legs. My thighs parted automatically. I struggled to breathe. His

fingers pressed into me and my brain short circuited. My muscles clamped around his clever fingers. His other squeezed my nipple almost painfully. I bit my lip and drew blood. His glare held me in place while his hands worked. I moaned his name. Reality was suddenly an afterthought.

"This belongs to me," he growled roughly in my ear as his fingers pressed deep inside me. I could only manage a pathetic nod before submitting to blissful oblivion.
Chapter Ten

June 14th, 2003

"So I thought that the groom was supposed to dance with the bride at these shindigs?" Remy's heavy Cajun twang floated through the shadows of the sparsely lit balcony. I didn't turn to face him –afraid that he would see the tears that fought to break free of the shaky emotional dam I had hastily constructed.

I shrugged a bare shoulder, "Don't you know the wedding rule of thumb? Someone borrowed him from Blu, before he's married, c'mon let's screw."

"Never heard that one, Sugar."

"My bridesmaids decided to start a new tradition." I wrapped my arms around myself in an attempt to suppress all of the feelings attempting to push through. Flashes of the memory of Aiden with his pants around his ankles while he banged anonymous, insignificant bridesmaid number five, two nights ago surfaced before I could catch it.

A cold acidic chill passed right through me as I fought to suppress another shudder. Remy pulled me into the warm comfort of his arms and tucked my head against the solid wall of his chest. In that instant I didn't give a rat's ass who saw me as I let the emotional storm smother me.

He tipped my face up to his as two rogue tears slid down my face.

"You'll ruin your mascara," he said softly catching the tears with the pads of his thumbs.

"It's waterproof," I smiled weakly.

"That's my girl," he hugged me again.

"Actually, that's my girl," Aiden's cold voice cut the night and froze my spine—I held myself still. Slowly, I pulled out of Remy's arms and quickly wiped away the straggling tears with the handkerchief he handed me.

"A moonlit tryst with your lover in plain view of our guests;" he tsked childishly, but the anger was clearly etched in his stance.

"What would gentle society say?"

My hand caught Remy's arm before he lunged for Aiden. He relaxed a hair allowing me to release the breath I obliviously held.

"You should have thought about the delicate sensibilities of gentle society before you decided to treat my bridesmaids like your personal buffet line."

" _Last dance, ladies and gentlemen, for the bride and groom,"_ the MC's voice announced through the hidden gardens speakers surrounding the balcony. Aiden simply held out his hand expectantly—the ever present condescending smirk on his lips.

"Mrs. Wainwright?" he was enjoying the hell out of this. The sadistic fuck enjoyed making my life miserable and I just married him.

I took his hand and forcefully replaced my dismay with a carefully constructed mask of serenity and happiness.

From the dance floor, soft light glowed from the hundreds of tea light candles spread through the various surfaces of the grand ballroom. We swayed to Tangerine Dream's "Loved by the Sun." His arms held me close as we danced to our mothers' favorite song. My head rested on his shoulder and I closed my eyes in deceptive tranquility.

"I don't want to see you with him again," Aiden's lips moved against my ear. Butterfly wings brushed against the walls of my stomach.

"You won't have to worry about seeing us together," his arm tightened briefly on my waist before relaxing again. I hated to admit that I loved the way his hair curled around my fingers when I brushed the back of his neck. I indulged myself briefly, as he seemingly relished my touch. _Damn he deserved an academy award._

"Good to know."

"I mean, I don't see how you'll be able to see us from Pennsylvania. Philly is quite a ways from Durham." Aiden's broad shoulders tensed under my fingers for a fraction of a second before turning glacial eyes on me. How the hell did he get his eyes to do that? As if it never happened, his eyes returned to an-almost convincing warmth. I would have missed the flaw in his affection if I didn't know him the way I did.

A beautiful smile spread over his face. He was up to something. Aiden was as adept at constructing masks as I was— spotting this one wasn't difficult. The malice hidden within his beautiful green eyes would have been heartbreaking if I had anything else to break.

His hand settled possessively on my hip as he spun me out and pulled me back again for a dip. He leaned forward, "I supposed this means it's time to adjust the rules of our little war," he whispered across my lips before his mouth came crashing down onto mine in a possessive kiss drenched in lust.

Involuntarily, heat spread through my body as the crowd hollered their approval.

"You owe me," he said before pulling away.
Epilogue

April 3, 2004

The beat blazed on igniting a fire in me I thought burned out long ago. The last few weeks filled me with nothing but stress and dread as I was surrounded by Aiden's face. He graced the cover of every tabloid magazine within a five mile radius of my apartment. He had been reportedly linked to several women in the past year. He'd been angry since I'd decided to go to Duke. He'd assumed that I went because of Remy—I was too stubborn to correct him.

Recently, he'd been spotted with the same woman several times... some leggy brunette. Obviously, he didn't have any problems getting adjusted to college life.

Vaughn, my roommate, along with much prodding from Remy convinced me to make the trip to Mexico with them for Spring Break. I was glad I gave in. The beach side club was hot despite the ocean breeze. The packed place pulsed with a sultry Spanish beat that flamed like the heat. The thin yellow tank top I wore was pasted to my skin. I was thankful for the bikini underneath. Remy was at the bar flirting with the bartender. Vaughn got swept into the crowd when we arrived an hour ago.

I'd been in Cabo San Lucas for three days sulking miserably in my hotel room. Tonight I was already a few shots in and was ready for some real fun.

Sweaty hands gripped my waist, purposely trying to slip under my short pleated white skirt. I dug my heels into the sand covered dance floor and pushed my anonymous partner away. I may have been a fun drunk, but I wasn't that fun. My hips continued to sway to the beat as the music switched to one of Enrique Iglesias' recent hits. Sweaty hands made another pass but I dodged him quickly again before frustration burned through my alcohol induced haze.

A familiar chill ran up my spine ran as I was pulled against the solid wall of a man's chest. The smell of the ocean and _his_ cologne filled my nose.

"I believe what my wife was trying to say was fuck off," dangerous steel lined every edge of Aiden's voice. His face was tight with irritation.

"My, what great timing you have," I didn't realize how much my words slurred. Damn, I knew that last jaeger bomb was a bad idea. He was the last person I needed to hallucinate about.

"The better to save your tight little ass, my dear," he responded in kind. He grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the crowded club. Maybe this wasn't my imagination. He looked too good in his dark polo and khaki shorts. His hair looked like he'd run his hands through it several times in frustration. Or maybe brunette Barbie ran her hands through it. Bile and a cluster of angry tears burned the back of my throat at the thought. The way he scowled at me indicated I was the source of said frustration. I swallowed hard.

"You know it figures that you would let Romeo and your roommate talk you into coming here." His eyes glittered like jewels in the night against the club's light.

"And if I dragged them here?" I crossed my arms and cocked my eyebrow at him. He shoved his hands in his pockets looking bored.

"Adric called. He was worried you'd get yourself into trouble out here."

"It's no concern of yours."

"My wife is my concern."

"What does your arm candy think of your concern?" I slung back defiantly. He just smirked at me. My own irritation and hurt mixed with all the tequila shots I'd done stiffened my spine.

"What's the matter Aiden? Kind of hard not to know what my husband's up to. I just figured that I'd have a little fun of my own. It's been a rough semester and I want to dance." I turned away from him and headed back to the club. Tired of the sweat soaked shirt, I pulled it off and tossed it to Remy on my way back to the center of the dance floor.

Head tossed back and my hands in the air; I closed my eyes and swayed to Nelly telling everyone to take their clothes off. The firm, sure hands of my husband pulled me back against his chest. "You'll only dance for me," he said in my ear and moved against me to the music.

Kevin Lyttle's heavy island accent infiltrated the speakers, singing about the temptation in touching. I ground my hips against him, swaying to the Caribbean beat. Sweat slid down my chest soaking the top of my bikini. The heat and humidity had long since frizzed and curled my hair, undoing the work my flat iron did. I pulled the curly mass off my neck and secured it with a band without missing a beat. I reached backwards and gripped the strong muscles of Aiden's thighs as I dipped low and wound my way slowly back up. I felt his erection press up against my back as his grip tightened on my waist. He breathed harshly against my neck as he moved with me.

An hour later, my back slammed up against the wall of his hotel suite. His tongue clashed with mine as he pulled down the bikini bottoms and pumped into me hard. There was no romanticism. All of our foreplay was left on the dance floor. We mated, we fucked and I came hard and fast twice before approaching another orgasm. My hands gripped his shoulders as he buried his face in my neck and filled me to the brim. It had been months since we'd been together and my poor vibrator needed a vacation.

His hands gripped my hips and he groaned my name as we both came. How we always managed to go from fighting to fucking never ceased to amaze me. Catching my breath, I pushed away from him and sank to the floor. He always had the ability to shake every nerve inside of me. He muttered a curse before pushing away from the wall and straightening his clothes. Coming back from the bathroom he cleaned me off and helped me up. He stared at my hands but didn't let go. The door to the suite beeped and swung open. The leggy brunette that haunted my every nightmare walked in wearing a short silk green robe.

"You're back," she smiled at him and threw her expertly tanned arms around him. He dropped my hand to catch her and set her down.

Thankfully, I'd had the foresight to put my briefs back on. I turned to leave. I didn't want to intrude on the intimate moment. Before I could take to steps, Aiden's hand locked down on my wrist.

"I told you not to follow me here," he scolded Playboy Barbie. Her thin pink lips dropped in a less than flattering frown.

"But you looked so bummed when you got that call from home. Besides, what about her?" she finally acknowledged my presence. Was it bimbo code to talk in a baby voice to get whatever they wanted?

"That was my business, Lilith. Just like this she is," he ground out. Aiden's jaw clicked audibly—a clear sign that she was tap dancing her six inch stilettos on his last available nerve. I choked on a grin and resisted the urge to cheer.

"What if I want to be your business?" She rubbed her breasts against his arm but he pulled back and tightened his drip on my wrist when I pulled.

"That's reserved for my wife."

"I can be that," she purred like a desperate cat.

"That would be illegal, considering he's already married to me. Besides, he's Catholic not Mormon," I finally spoke up. Every cell in danced in triumph as her face crumpled and red heat of embarrassment invaded her every pore.

I flipped my wrist and flashed the antique wedding ring. Call me a sucker, but yes I still wore my ring. It was an excellent man repellant whenever Remy wasn't around.

"Liar," she spat venomously. What the hell was it with him and poisonous brunettes?

"Lilith Carter, may I present my wife, Lucky Wainwright," he grinned and wrapped his arm around my waist pulling me to his side. Leave it to us to be able to work together to make someone else miserable. Lilith ignored my outstretched hand and stormed out of the room like a petulant child. Before, I could pull away from Aiden, he tightened his arm around my wrist.

"I do believe I have so unfinished business with my wife." He pulled the tie from my hair and stepped back as the curly mass fell over my shoulders. He slid the deadbolt on the door in place and cut off the main light. Soft florescent light illuminated the suite's living room. Aiden sunk down onto the plush white sofa in front of me.

"Strip, wife." What do you know? Like a moron, I did.

Re-Educating L.B. Wainwright

"Care to explain why this is starting to sound like you want me to apologize to her for getting pregnant by my husband?" I shoveled a spoonful of multigrain cereal into my mouth, trying to ignore my father. I had been hiding out in Bettingford for the last three days, avoiding my condo in Richmond. Had I known it meant listening to my father lecture me about not speaking to Summer, then I'd have taken my chances with running into Aiden.

"I'm not saying that you should apologize to her. I just think that not speaking to her, is really hurting her feelings." His audacity backhanded me so hard my neck was sore from the whiplash.

"Dear me, how absolutely selfish I'm being. I endured three years of torture in school from Aiden, for something that had nothing to do with me. Then was bound to him like a slave in matrimony at the threat of having my entire future taken from me. I have to fake my way through a pregnancy, postponing my divorce from satan, just to make Scott happy. Meanwhile my sister's the one who is really knocked up by my husband. Geez dad. What an inconsiderate bitch I've been." I slammed my bowl down into the sink and closed my eyes trying to regroup all of my scattered thoughts and feelings. My father visibly flinched and tensed at my words. I had hurt him, but I didn't give a damn. Not many people were taking into account how shitty I'd been treated.

Summer and Cadence, who'd been sitting at the breakfast table didn't say a word. I kissed Cadence good morning and completely ignored Summer's existence. My father didn't appreciate my passive aggressive approach to the entire situation, but I was above having a girl fight at 25. Honestly, I still didn't know how to deal with her. We'd always been close; I just had no idea that she and Aiden were closer.

"Lucky, this is a family. We are loyal and we stick together." My father's quiet frosted tone penetrated the thick air.

"Yes. We do stick together don't we Summer? Stuck so well that you fucked my husband like some loyal side bitch." I leveled my gaze with hers. Her lip trembled but she didn't break eye contact. I was over the injured puppy routine that always came over her that had us running to defend her at every turn. I didn't give a damn if it was selfish but I was over this episode of Jerry Springer that had suddenly become my life. It was time to defend me.

"Had you done your job as his wife, then he wouldn't need to turn to me, now would he?" She threw back at me. My father and Cadence gasped so hard, they nearly sucked the air out of the room. So the pussy has finally bared her claws. I smirked at her and grabbed my briefcase. I kissed my father and Cadence on the cheek before grabbing my keys. Summer continued to gloat, hand on her flat stomach.

"Tell me something Summer," I turned back before leaving and met her stare. "You're doing such a bang up job keeping his attention. He calls you by my name still doesn't he?" Every malicious nerve in my body danced in victory as her face fell and skin paled.

"That's what I thought," I backtracked to her. "Let me explain something to you about my marriage, little girl." I leaned forward over the small round table. I was so close to her we shared air. She swallowed hard and breathed deep.

"Aiden can run through as many phases of the moon as he pleases, but there is only one that ever crosses his lips or stays on his mind." She inhaled sharply.

"Blu," Aiden called my name softly. My spine stiffened and my lip curled in a spiteful smile before turning to face him. Cadence hid a grin behind her hand and winked discreetly at me. She'd been furious about the whole thing and was pissed at Summer. She'd told me last night that she was worried that my disdain for Summer had spilled over to her.

I sat at my father's desk in the study going over accounts that needed my attention. Tapping on the open door brought my attention to Cadence holding a bottle of red wine and two glasses.

" _Can we talk for a minute?" She came into the office and sat across from me. She poured the wine in the glasses and handed me one. I took a sip allowing the warm liquid to roll over my tongue and slide down my throat._

" _Don't hate me." Her brown eyes shone with unshed tears and my heart fractured a bit. I closed the files and pushed them aside and watched the myriad of doubt, love, and sadness played out on her face. I often forgot that I was raised in a world where schooling my emotions was key. I didn't think I was uptight or anything, but letting your guard down could be your downfall. We ran in vicious circles._

" _I don't hate you." I smiled at her the sighed deeply. "If anything, I hate myself for letting things get this far." I reluctantly admitted. I picked up a mystics and mythology class as an elective my first year at Duke. In the class we learned about people and their auras. Cadence had a bright white, pure aura. She was so good and strove to make everyone happy. As cheesy and clichéd as it sounded, her heart was always in the right place. Her aura was nothing like mine, with so many dark spots and tinged dirty with grey._

" _You're good to my dad and Letta Leigh. I love you for that alone. Everything else is a bonus." I smiled at her again and squeezed her hand on the table. She giggled and raised her glass to me._

" _To the people who drive us crazy."_

I clinked her glass obligingly, "I'd gladly share a padded cell with you."
