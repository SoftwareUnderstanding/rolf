for "Instilling Universal Knowledge" Project Workshops

The trainer's guide manual for "Instilling Universal Knowledge" project is a complete guide that contains detailed training workshops that help deliver the goals of the project to the children aged 6-8 years old.

The guiding manual contains eleven training workshops, each carries a different idea that doesn't depend on the other workshops in the training guide. The trainer can deliver the workshops in the same order presented in the guide or can choose the order according to what is more appropriate to the students.

#  Important Points to Take into Consideration When Implementing This Guide

Trainer

In addition to the skill of dealing with children that the trainer needs, when attempting to present any kind of programs to them, it is important for the trainer to take the following points into consideration:

* To be aware of the ways to deal with children aged between 6-8 years.  
* The trainer should read the supporting material including the booklets and educational material related to the workshop that can be downloaded from Be-Free website: www.befreepro.prg to know the concepts that the workshop is trying to convey better.  
* The trainer need to be flexible and cheerful during the workshop and encourages all student to participate.  
* Make sure not to comment on the students' opinions during the workshop in any way that contains humiliation, scolding, or belittlement of them in any way (directly, indirectly, or implicitly). Moreover, the trainer shouldn't allow students to comment on what another student's answer in an offensive or inappropriate way either.  
* Try to keep the workshop's environment fun until the end, and work on encouraging self-confidence and respecting others throughout the workshop.

Note: the trainer may be referred to as a female in this manual because females are mostly the ones that deal with this age group of children.

#  Implementation of the Workshops

• It is preferred that the place where the workshop will be held in is a spacious place so that students can move freely, and has good ventilation, and lighting.

• It is better if students are seated in a way that they can see each other, the trainer, and the front panel clearly. If that's not possible the students can be seated in a way that they can see the trainer and whatever the students or the trainer are presenting clearly.

• It is preferred that the trainer determine the order of students' participation before starting the exercise, so they can get ready. Example: from right participant to left or the opposite.

• Most of the exercises consists of activities, thus the trainer can give the students their work to take it with them home, or to hang it in class if possible.

• During the exercises, it is important that the trainer makes sure that all the students understood what she is explaining.

• It is important that the trainer makes sure the required materials of papers, pens, colors , etc, are enough for all the students.

• Most of the activities require a board to hang the student's work on it, if that is not possible, the trainer can use a rope to hang on their work, or students can stick it on the wall with any appropriate adhesive tape. This applies to any other materials used in the activities as well, if they are not available, the trainer can replace it with something similar that fits the purpose.

#  Workshops' Structure

This exercise aims to help the child know what it means to be confident, and help him or her feel it and know its importance.

Duration:

10-15 minutes approx.

Implementation Steps:

• The trainer sits with the children in semicircle, In a way that all children can see the triangle and the two steps.

• The trainer explains that every child including those present in the workshop is a strong, capable and a confident human being. The trainer walks with a firm straight back to show how confident children should walk, and the students follow. In the case of the presence of a child who can't stand or has some motor disability, she explains that sitting with the back straight and the head held high gives the same feeling and impression.

• The trainer explains the exercise to the children whilst doing it herself. She tells them that every child will stand on the two cardboard footsteps while his back is straight, and will walk with a straight back until he gets into the triangle, taking one of the necklaces from inside the cardboard and wearing it, than standing confidently and saying, "I am strong and confident".

• After finishing the exercise the trainer holds up the paper that carries the slogan so that all children can see it, she points on the slogan and they all repeat, " I am strong and confident".
Main Exercise  
I Am Strong and Confident

Exercise Objective:

This exercise aims at helping children:

• Teach the students the required skills for them to prevent the negative impact of bad words that can affect their self-esteem and confidence.  
• Some of the skills that help students feel confident:  
\- Something special they can do.  
\- Something good and useful they like doing.  
\- Learn something new.

Duration:

45 – 50 minutes.

Implementation Steps:

This exercise is divided into two main parts, each has its own slogan:

The first slogan "I don't allow the harmful words into my heart"

The trainer sits with the children in semicircle so that they can all see her and the characters of the story clearly.  
The trainer uses the puppets and moves them around and changes her voice during the story to attract the children's attention. She starts with Hana and Amer:

"Hana was sitting in the kindergarten with a big frown on her face."  
Amer approaches her and says: Hello, Hana  
Hana: Hello, Amer.  
Amer: what's wrong Hana? Why do you look sad?  
Hana: Today, my friend Mariam told me that I am stupid, dump and I don't know how to color properly, and Salma is way better than me.

• The trainer wears the puppet Eman, instead of Amer and says:  
**"I am Hana's friend and I need you to help Hana."**

So she asks them the following questions, waiting for them to answer each question before she moves on to the next one:

**\- Why is Hana sad?  
\- Are the words that Mariam told Hana like: "stupid, dumb, and can't colour properly" are good or bad words?  
\- How can we help Hana not to allow those bad words into her heart?  
**The trainer gives the students about five minutes to answer.

• Eman explains that the bad words that Mariam had said to Hana had entered Hana's heart and annoyed her, and that all children will help Hana abandon the bad words next time.

• Eman holds the shield in front of Hana as if it was stuck to her chest. The trainer makes sure that all children can see Hana and the shield clearly.

• Eman continues: Hana is a smart child, she will always imagine this shield in front of her and will never allow the bad words into her heart. So if Mariam told her that she is stupid and doesn't understand anything, she wouldn't allow the bad words to enter her heart. That's because she knows that she is smart and she also knows that all children are smart, she can tell Mariam that she is smart and not stupid.

• After finishing, the trainer holds up the paper that carry the slogan in a way that allows all the children to see it and repeats the slogan with the children **"I don't allow the bad words into my heart".**

The second slogan "I am strong and confident"

• The children sit in any way that allows them to see the drawings and the trainer clearly.

• The trainer distributes the drawing of the shield to the children.

• The trainer explains that they are going to create a strong shield that helps us prevent the bad words from entering our hearts, and helps us see the beautiful things that we've got, and that helps us have more confidence in ourselves.

• The trainer explains that each child can do a good thing, no matter how small that thing was. Everything that a child does and tries to be better at is important. Whenever children try to concentrate and pay attention to what they are doing while enjoying it, it would give them more strength.

• The trainer asks the children to draw or write anything they can do very well, or would like to work on getting better at on the first section of the shield. The trainer can help the children recognize that anything, even if it is a small thing, is important. Even if it was helping their mother in the kitchen, bringing a glass of water, cleaning the room, taking care of their younger siblings, it's still important. The trainer gives enough time for this exercise.

• The trainer explains that each child can do useful things even if those things were very small. Everything useful a child does can add to his strength and confidence. The trainer can give examples of some of those things, like: helping, doing something that'll make another person happy, teaching another child something he doesn't know, playing with the kids that are bullied and neglected by others, ...

• The trainer asks the children to draw or write in the second section of the shield anything useful they do or like doing. The trainer gives enough time for this step.

• The trainer explains that learning is a very important thing and gives great strength to children, because every information a child learns gives him strength, and the more children love learning the stronger they become.

• The trainer asks children to draw or write in the third section of the shield anything they have learned or would like to learn. The trainer gives enough time for this step.

• The trainer asks the children to step forward, one by one. Each child holds his or her shield up and says the slogan, "I am strong and confident", the trainer encourages the children to applause every child after he finishes. In case the trainer was in short of time, she can ask all children to stand at the same time, hold their shields above their heads, and say the slogan together at the same time.

• The trainer explains that smart, strong, and confident children, like them, concentrate on doing something good and useful every day, and learn new things. This way they become strong and confident.

• The trainer tells the children to imagine the shield every time they hear harmful words from someone, and every time they want to feel more confident.

• The trainer holds the paper with the slogan up high so that all the children can see it, or point at the board if the slogan was written on it, and repeats the slogan with them "I am strong and confident"

• The trainer starts telling the story and shows the board and characters to the children along with playing their roles between one paragraph and the next, as shown below:

"Salem and the Smart Crayons" story

The first paragraph:

"On a nice day, the crayons were all cheerful and exited as they were getting ready to see their friend Salem. After a while, Salem came into his room happy and glad to see the crayons he loves, and likes meeting, he greeted them and started talking to them.

**Salem** : "Hello crayons."  
"Hello Salem, come and sit with us." **the crayons replied**. **  
Salem sat near his friends the crayons while looking very happy.**  
"What's up Salem? You look very happy today." **The green crayon said.**  
"Yes my friend, today I feel that I am a strong child" **Salem said**.  
**The crayons all jumped together and said** : "What made you feel strong? Tell us, we are very excited to know!"  
"I will tell you what happened to me today." **Salem said** "On my way home after I left school, a stranger spoke to me and asked me if I needed a ride home instead of walking in the hot weather, and he was going to take me to the store to buy me ice cream."  
"And did you go with him?" **asked the blue crayon**.

The First discussion:

• The trainer explains **the meaning of feelings** first, by saying that God has given each one of us feelings, and that we all have them to help us know what is good and what is not. Feelings are just like an inner voice that alerts us about what is right and what is wrong.

• She tells them that she is going to use the bell as a physical alarm for the concept of feelings.

• The trainer explains the concept of **acting smart** , and that it is to do what our feelings tell us that it is good to do, and not to do what our feelings tell us that it is bad to do. For example, when someone asks us to do something that we feel uncomfortable with, knowing that it's wrong, we refuse to do it and speak to our parents about it.

• The trainer explains that whenever she speaks about feelings she is going to ring the bell, and that when she speaks about the action taken she is going to clap once.

• The trainer rings the bill once and asks the children afterwards about the feelings: **"When the stranger told Salem: Come into the car I will drive you instead of walking in this hot weather, what do you think Salem's feelings told him? Did they tell Salem that what the stranger is asking for is right or wrong?"** the trainer listens to the children's answers.

• The trainer claps once and asks the children: " **Salem knew it was wrong to go with the stranger and his feelings also told him that this is wrong. So, does Salem go with the stranger to get ice cream from the supermarket?** " the trainer asks the children to clap once and then say their answers at the same time.

• The trainer explains that Salem has acted smart and that they are going to know what his smart action was when she finishes the story.  
The trainer continues with what Salem said:

**Salem** : "No, I didn't go with him. I said 'No' in a very loud voice because he is a stranger, I don't know him, and because I am a smart, strong, and a safe child, I don't go with strangers".  
The children applause Salem and the trainer repeats with the children the following sentence: **  
"Thank you, thank you my feelings ... You help me act smart"**

The Second Paragraph:

**Red Crayon:** "Didn't you want to go with him, Salem, when he told you he was going to buy you ice cream? Don't you like ice cream?".

The Second Discussion:

• The trainer explains to the children that whenever she speaks about feelings she is going to ring the bell. And whenever she speaks about the action she is going to clap once.

• The trainer rings the bill and asks the children about feelings: **"When the man told Salem he was going to buy him ice cream, what do you think Salem's feelings told him? Did they tell him that it was a good thing or a bad thing?"** the trainer listens to the children's answers.

• The trainer claps once then asks the children: **"Even though Salem loves ice cream, Salem knew it was wrong to take ice cream from a stranger and his feelings told him that it was wrong too. Salem is a smart child, so would he go with the strange man to get the ice cream just because he loves it?"** the trainer asks the children to clap once all together and say their answer at the same time.

• The trainer explains that Salem acted smart and that we will know what he did when we finish the story.

• After the discussion the trainer continues the story and the dialogue between Salem and his crayons to explain Salem's smart action:

**Salem** : "Yes, I do love ice cream but I don't take anything from strangers, and I don't accept gifts from strangers even if they offered something I like".

All children applause Salem and the trainer repeats with the children:

"Thank you, thank you my feelings ... You help me act smart"

The Third Paragraph:

**Yellow Crayon:** "And did he leave after that?".

**Salem** : "Yes, he left, but before he left he said, "This is a secret between me and you. So don't tell anyone what I told you."

**Green** **Crayon** : "What did you feel, Salem, when he told you not to tell anyone?".

• The trainer explains again to the children that whenever she speaks about feelings she is going to ring the bill, and whenever she speaks about actions she is going to clap once.

• The trainer rings the bill once and then asks the children about feelings: When the man asked Salem not to tell anyone what he had just told him, what did Salem's feelings tell him? Is it a good secret that would make Salem feel good, or a bad secret which would make Salem have an unpleasant feeling? The trainer listens to the children's answers.

• The trainer claps once and asks the children: **"Salem knew it was a bad secret because he felt uncomfortable and annoyed. He knows that he shouldn't keep bad secrets untold to one of his parents or older siblings. So would Salem tell that secret to any person?"** the trainer asks the children to clap together once and then say their answers at the same time.

• The trainer explains that Salem acted smart and that we are going to know what that smart action was, when we continue the story.

• After the discussion the trainer continues with the story and the dialogue between Salem and his crayons:

**Salem** : "I felt uncomfortable, as if there was an inside voice telling me that what that man asked me to do was wrong and because he knows that too, he asked me not to tell anyone. But I told my father about it."

All the crayons jumped happily and cheerfully on Salem's table and brought him a paper and asked him to write what he had learnt today in the form of a beautiful slogan using crayons, them hanging it on his room's wall.

Salem: "Ok then my slogan will be **'Because I am a strong, smart, and safe child ... I trust my feelings' "**.

Salem wrote the slogan with the help of the crayons, then they danced and jumped and repeated along with Salem: "Because I am a strong, smart, and safe child ... I trust my feelings".

Salem was happy with the slogan and hung it on the wall of his room. He always wanted to remember it, and continue telling his parents about everything that happens to him, because he really is a strong, smart, and safe child that trusts his feelings.

• The trainer repeats the slogan in a loud voice with the children: **"Because I am a strong, smart and a safe child ... I trust my feelings"**
Evaluative Exercise

If time allows, it is a good idea to give the children an evaluative exercise. She can choose one of the following exercises or any exercise that she finds more appropriate.

• Print the story characters (non coloured) on a white paper and asks them to colour it.  
• Print "Because I am a strong, smart, and a safe child ... I trust my feelings" slogan, in a way that allows them to colour inside the empty letters.  
• The children can express any part of the story by drawing it.

After a long wait the guests arrived. Mariam and Ahmed were so surprised when they saw the different customs their guests were wearing, and the different ways of giving Eid presents to children. As one family gave small, beautiful toys and another gave money, while Mr. Haj Kareem gathered the children and told them a story as an Eid present.  
The children sat together to talk with each other and found out that they were so different in so many aspects.

• The trainer asks the children the following question and listens to their answers: ''Will the world be more beautiful if there was only one kind of insects or is it more beautiful with the various types of insects?"

• The trainer continues reading the story:

The third paragraph:

The insects that lived in the garden were very sad to hear the children argue and make fun of each other's differences. They gathered together and decided to teach the children few things about the differences. The insects wanted to tell the children that differences are beautiful and not a bad thing, and that no child should is allowed to hurt or make fun of another child because he is different.  
The insects also wanted the children to know that no child is better than the other because he is different. Each person lives differently and has a different taste, likes and dislikes. This is an awesome thing! Because if everybody had the exact same taste, habits and way of thinking, the world will be boring. There will be no inventions, discoveries, or anything new.

The Earthworm and the beetle walked towards the children and the rest of the insects followed them. The earthworm greeted the children and asked "Why are you fighting children? Why do you think differences are bad and say cruel things to each other because of them?" the children were looking at the earthworm in surprise as it continued to speak "Look at me children.

I am very different from my friend; the Beetle. I am light and striped while she is dark and looks different than me. I love her, she is my friend and she loves me.

She respects me even though I am tall and thin and don't have any legs and I respect her even though she is very dark and fat compared to me. I learn patience and calmness from her."

Then came the Butterfly and the Grasshopper.

The Butterfly smiled to the children and said "This Grasshopper has tall legs and can jump to high places while I cannot. On the other hand, I have a blend of beautiful colors on my wings while he doesn't.

Despite our differences we fly together each time we meet. I respect him deeply and he respects me. I am amazed by his love and devotion to his Grasshopper friends. I learned a lot from the way they cooperate and work together."

Then came the Cockroach and the Ant...

The Cockroach looked at the children and said "This Ant is so small and fragile compared to me. I am much bigger and I can move much faster. But we are best friends and we respect each other very much. I am amazed by her orderliness and her enthusiasm."

The Earthworm spoke again and said "We insects respect the differences among us. We learn new things from one another and try to live with peace and happiness. We are happy to have different friends and we spend our time loving, respecting and helping each other.

You can learn and grow from your differences and from each other too."

The Beetle added "think about this; children...think...you can learn from each other, and you can help people around you learn from their differences and learn to respect other different people too".

The children smiled and thanked the insects and promised them to think about what they said. Since that day, the children never mocked any different child and always kept in mind that differences bring goodness and knowledge to the world. This made them happier and more successful.

The children started by agreeing on a game to play. They enjoyed their afternoon and had lots of fun together.

The group discussion:

The trainer asks the children the following questions one after the other after hearing their answer for each one before moving to the next:

• **"In what way did the insects differ from each other?"  
• "What did the insects teach us in this story?"**

• **"How do you think life will be if all children decided to learn one new thing from someone who differs from them every day?"  
• "How can you encourage your friends to learn from the differences in others?"  
**

Main Exercise

The Most Beautiful Thing about an Animal

• The trainer puts all the animals inside cardboard box, and asks each child to put his or her hand inside the box and pulls out a picture of a certain animal and mention its name.

• The trainer holds the picture of the gazelle and speaks on behalf of it. The gazelle says that the children might find the animals or insects they have annoying and unattractive, and yet there is something beautiful about each animal.

• The gazelle asks the children to step forward to where the Styrofoam is positioned and asks each child to mention something beautiful about the animal or the insect they've got in their hands, the gazelle can help the children if a child found difficulty in doing so. The gazelle asks the children to insert their animal or insect in the Styrofoam after they mention the beautiful thing about it. The trainer encourages children to give applause to each child after he or she are done.

• The gazelle mentions some examples about the concept of starting with the best thing in others. For example: if a child had a brother who doesn't organize his things and she wanted to tell him that he needs to organize them, she can start with the best thing in her brother which is "loves helping others and assisting them" for example. So she can say: ''You love helping others, so it would have been better if you had organized your things so that others wouldn't do that for you.''

• Or if there was a generous child but he gets angry quickly and causes many problems, we can tell him: ''You are generous but when you get angry suddenly your friends can't see your generosity, it would be nice if you could be kinder to them.''

The group discussion:

The trainer asks the following questions one after the other and listens to the answers of the children before moving to the next one:

• "How do you feel when the other person starts with the best thing about you?"  
• "Would it help in decreasing the fights and troubles if children started with the best things in the child they are speaking to?"  
• "How can you help your friends and family to start with the best thing in others when speaking to them?"

Main Exercise

I Love Tolerance

Exercise Objective:

This exercise aims at:  
• Introducing the meaning of tolerance to children as "accepting the different thoughts of others and allowing them to voice them".  
• Explaining to children that tolerance decreases problems and brings children closer together.

Duration:

45 - 50 minutes approx.

Implementation Steps:

• The trainer sets with the children in semicircle.

• The trainer distributes the papers and colouring pencils or crayons to the children.

• The trainer explains the exercise by saying that if we had a crown and we wanted to put it on the head of an animal, draw the animal that you think is your favourite and you would like to choose it to be the one that is crowned. The trainer gives 5 -10 minutes for drawing.

• The trainer asks each child to stand in the front of the room and tell the others what animal had he or she chose, and why is it his or her favourite, then stick the drawing on the board under the crown. The trainer can help children stick the drawings if it was difficult for them.

• After all children are done participating, the trainer asks the children the following questions and listens to their answers for each one before moving to the next question.

• It is possible for the trainer to choose a puppet to ask the children the questions and to ask them to give themselves applause after answering each question before moving to the next one, in order to add energy and excitement to the discussion:

\- "Are your favorite animals the same?"  
\- "Why did your favorite animals differ from each other?"  
\- "You chose a different animal from your friend, would you like it if your friend made fun of the animal you chose?"  
\- "You chose a different animal from your friend, would you like it if your friend pulled your drawing of the board and told you that your animal is not suitable?"  
\- "You chose a different animal from your friend, would you like it if your friend interrupted you and didn't allow you to speak about your favorite animal?"  
\- "You chose a different animal from your friend, how would you like your friend to treat you for choosing an animal that is different from his?"

• The trainer explains that tolerance means that even though the other children have different opinions from yours, you respect their opinions and allow them to express them without interrupting or making fun of them, even if you didn't like their opinions. The trainer asks the children the following two questions and gives the children enough time to discuss them and come up with practical examples. The trainer can help the children with that:

\- "Will the children be happier if they had treated each other with tolerance while playing, in school and at home?"  
\- "How can you make tolerance your companion when dealing with the other children in school, home and everywhere?"

• After finishing the discussion the trainer asks the children to stand and she explains that each one of them has a thinking brain, and she asks them to repeat together ''I have a thinking brain''.

• After finishing the trainer asks the children to gather in a circle in order to get closer to each other.

• The trainer explains that all children have a favorite animal and that they all have put some serious thinking to come up with that animal and chose it for a reason. Each one of you has a thinking brain and a beautiful idea. If all our ideas were gathered together we would make one big brain and we'd have so many ideas that we can listen to from each other, learn from and allow our brains to grow with them.

• The trainer asks the children to repeat together "I love tolerance". "Tolerance makes my brain bigger".
Evaluation Exercise

The trainer can choose any evaluation exercise she finds suitable whether drawing, or using the other craft materials to express that tolerance makes one's brain bigger, or that tolerance makes the relationships between children better.

• The trainer brings the paper bag characters and moves them according to the following story as she tries to change her voice as much as possible with each character in the story to attract the children.

• The trainer uses the puppets of Hassan and Ahmed to explain what does a secret mean through the following story: **''Ahmed was setting alone when his friend Hassan approached him and spoke to him, then told him: Do not tell anyone what I had just told you.''**

• The trainer asks the children: **''What do we call what Hassan told his friend Ahmed?''** the trainer then listens to the children's answers.

• The trainer explains that this is called a secret and that the secret is something that one person tells another and doesn't want anyone else to know about it, just like what Hassan told Ahmed.

• The following steps aims at helping children to understand the meaning of a good secret in the first and the third part of the following story, and to the meaning of a bad secret in the second and fourth parts of the story. (If the time was tight, the trainer can tell only one story of the two stories explaining the good secret and one story of the two stories explaining the bad secret.)

The meaning of a good secret:

The trainer uses the girls puppets and calls them Soha and Amal.

''Soha came to her friend Amal and told her that they will buy a beautiful present for their friend Noor for her birthday and they want it to be a surprise for her. So don't tell her about it.''

The group discussion:

The trainer asks the children the following questions and listens to their answers according to the available time:

\- What was the secret that Soha told Amal?  
\- How do you think Amal felt when she heard the secret?

• The trainer distributes the first paper bags and the crayons on the children.

• The trainer asks the children to draw on the paper bag the feeling they have when they hear a good secret, the trainer gives 3 minutes for this activity.

• The trainer explains that we know the good secret through two main things:  
**\- First:** our feelings; when we hear a good secret we feel happy and comfortable. Just like the way Amal felt in the story.  
**\- Second:** the content of the good secret, as it would contain something good for us or for others, Just like when Amal was told about buying a present for the birthday party.

• The trainer asks each child to put his or her hand inside the paper bag that contains the good feeling and hold it up. Then she repeats along with them **''The good secret makes me feel happy''.**

The second story about good secret:

The trainer can discuss again the following story to make sure that the children understand the meaning of the good secret. There is no need to draw again on the paper bag or they can use the same bag they used.

The trainer uses two puppets and calls them Rami and Hisham:

''Hisham told his brother Rami: today in kindergarten the teacher gave me a star because my answer was the right answer, but don't tell anyone about this because I want it to be a surprise for mom when I tell her about it''

The meaning of the bad secret: the second story:

The trainer uses new characters and calls them Smai and the strange man.

''Sami was standing in front of his house door, when a man he doesn't know came to him and said: come tomorrow evening to the playground near your house I want to tell you something very important. But this is a secret between me and you, so you shouldn't tell anyone about it.''

Group discussion:

The trainer asks the children the following questions:

\- What was the secret that the stranger told to Sami?  
\- How do you think Sami felt when he heard that secret?

• The trainer distributes the second paper bag on the children.

• The trainer asks the children to draw the feelings they have with the bad secret on the paper bag. She gives three minutes for this step.

• The trainer explains that we can recognize the bad secret through two main things:

**\- First:** Our feelings; we would feel uncomfortable, annoyed or afraid when we hear a bad secret.  
**\- Second:** the contents of the bad secret; it would contain something that is not right, and in Smai's story it would be wrong if he went somewhere without telling his parents and without taking their permission, also it's wrong for the man to ask him to come alone, and if Sami did something without his parents knowledge it would be a wrong thing. So everything that the man told Sami was wrong and he was asking him to do wrong things.

• The trainer asks the children to put their hands inside the paper bags that they had drawn the bad feelings on, and put their hand up high in the air and repeat **''The bad secret gives me bad feelings''**

Another story for the bad secret:

The trainer can discuss again the following story to increase the children's understanding of the bad secret. There is no need to draw again or it's possible to use the same paper bag that they used before.

• The trainer uses puppets for a girl called Salma and a strange woman:

"The strange woman gave Salma money and told her don't tell anyone that I gave you this money."

~~***~~

"There is no place for the bad secret in my heart'' concept

• The trainer explains that smart children like you don't keep bad secrets and bad feelings and get them out of their hearts by telling them to one of their parents or older siblings for example.

• The trainer lifts up the paper that has the slogan written on it in a way that allows all children to see it, and repeats with the children: ''There is no place for the bad secret in my heart''

This exercise aims at introducing the following concepts to children:

• The concept of hope  
• The feelings associated with hope.  
• The feelings associate with someone who is hopeless.  
Duration:

15-20 minutes approx.

Implementation Steps:

• The children set in semicircle so that they can see the trainer and the characters of the story.

• The trainer brings a baize board and the character of the gazelle and moves it around on the board according to the story. The trainer should also try to change her voice for each character of the story to attract the children's attention during the presentation. The trainer tells the following story:

"In a rainy day the gazelle was running fast through the jungle, when suddenly she fell into a hole that she didn't notice, and because it was raining heavily her hooves sank deeper into the mud and she couldn't get out of the hole."

• The trainer explains that the gazelle hopes that she might, somehow, get out of the hole. Or she might not have hope and thinks that she will never be able to get out of the hole. We will see, now, how would the gazelle feel when she has hope, and how she would feel when she doesn't have hope.

• The trainer asks the children: **"How would the gazelle feel when she has hope to get out of the hole?"** after listening to the children's answers the trainer confirms that the gazelle would have a good feeling if she had hope of getting out of the hole.

• The trainer asks the children: **"How do you think the gazelle would feel if she has no hope of getting out of the hole?"** after listening to the children's answers the trainer confirms that the gazelle would not have a good feeling if she had no hope of getting out of the hole.

• The trainer asks the children to stand in semicircle, and tells them to imagine that we are the gazelle and that our hooves have sunk deep into the mud in a hole in the ground and she can't get it out.

• The trainer asks the children to imagine being the gazelle who has no hope, and is not having a good feeling because she thinks she wouldn't get out of the hole . Then asks them: how will she look like? The trainer encourages the children to act like the desperate gloomy gazelle who is not trying to get out or save herself.

• The trainer asks the children to imagine being the gazelle who has hope, and she is having good feelings because she thinks she can get out of the hole, then she asks them how will she look like? The trainer encourages the children to act and pose like the hopeful gazelle who is determined to save herself and keeps trying to get out of the hole.

• The trainer asks the children the following questions and listens to their answer for each question before moving on to the next one:  
**\- "Which gazelle is stronger and smarter, the gazelle who has got no hope or the gazelle who has hope?"  
\- "When you are in trouble, would you want to be like the gazelle who has no hope or like the gazelle who has hope?"**

• The trainer explains to the children that they are just like the gazelle. The children who have no hope would not have good feelings and wouldn't think of doing something to solve their problems, while the children who have hope would have good feelings that helps them do useful things to help themselves.

• The trainer repeats with the children **"We love hope".**

• The trainer holds the seed's model or picture and asks the children "What is this?" the trainer listens to their answers and tells them that it is a seed.

• The trainer tells the life story of the seed using the model or pictures to show the sequence of the phases it goes throw in its life. She can stop anywhere in the picture to elaborate more or to ask an interesting question that keeps the children engaged in the story and increases their interaction.

**"The seed was setting somewhere alone and thinking to herself: I don't want to be a seed for the rest of my life and die as a seed. I want to be a tree. The farmer planted the seed in the soil, but the seed didn't like the place and said: now I am all alone in the dark, how will I ever be a tree when I am buried underground while trees are supposed to be above the ground**.

The seed became sad but she held on to hope, and quickly pushed away the sadness and said: I know I can become a tree, that's why I am hoping to become a tree no matter how hard things get.  
I know there is a solution for everything. I'll be strong so that I grow up and my stem grows above earth so that I can look at the sky and look at people.  
A small stem grew out of the seed and she was very happy with it and was looking forward for the arrival of the farmer every day to give her water.  
One day the farmer forgot to give her water, so she felt sad but she quickly pushed the sadness away and held on to hope, and said: I know there is always a solution.  
She thought and then said: I know I can become a tree, and trees have roots. I will work on making my roots bigger so that they can look further away for water. Then her roots grew even more.  
If that seed hadn't had hope she wouldn't have become a tree, but with hope and thinking and working she became a big and a beautiful tree that people, the sky and the sun enjoy looking at every day."

• The trainer stands up and asks the children to stand and imagine themselves as that tree that has hope and has grown to become big and beautiful.

• The trainer asks the children to clap and repeat the following song. The trainer can sing it anyway she likes:

I love hope... I live with hope  
I push away sadness... I live with hope  
I was sad... and now I am happy  
With hope I think ... with hope I work  
I love hope ... I live with hope

• The trainer asks the children to set in semicircle and tells them that now she will tell them the story of a hopeful silkworm.

• The trainer holds the model of the silkworm or a picture of it and asks the children: **"What is this in my hand?"**. The trainer listens to their answers and then she explains that it is a silkworm.

• The trainer tells the life story of the silkworm using a model or pictures to explain the phases it goes through in its life. The trainer can stop anywhere she finds appropriate to elaborate more or to ask an interesting question to keep the children engaged and increase their interaction.

"Once upon a time this silkworm was living on a mulberry tree all alone and was thinking to herself: I don't want to be a silkworm for the rest of my life. I know I can be something else, I can fly and be pretty and colorful.  
The silkworm was sad but she decided to have hope.  
The silkworm held onto hope and pushed away sadness and said: I know I can become a butterfly, that's why I am hoping to become a butterfly one day no matter how hard things get.  
Then she said to herself: I know that there is a solution for everything. I'll be strong so that I can become a butterfly and fly and see the beautiful things in the world.  
The silkworm knew she had to eat to grow up, so she ate and ate and slowly she became a chrysalis.  
The silkworm became sad and said: now I am trapped, and I can't even see the sun. how will I ever be a beautiful butterfly.  
But the silkworm held on to hope and pushed away sadness immediately and said: there must be a solution.  
Few days later the chrysalis broke and out came a beautiful and colorful butterfly that is able to fly happily from one flower to the other."

The trainer stands up and asks the children to stand, and imagine themselves as that butterfly that has hope and that has become colourful and pretty and is able to fly everywhere.

I love hope... I live with hope
