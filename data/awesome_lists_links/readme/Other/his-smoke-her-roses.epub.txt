DEDICATION

To all the girls who are Loved far less than their brothers.

Dialogue tabs have been removed for e-book format.

Kansas City in the Thirties seemed wholesome as the town of Mayberry but was impervious as Gotham City. Haven to bootleggers and suitcase farmers, Kansas City promised everything to weary travelers on the edge of the churning Dust Bowl: a cool drink in a speak easy and a quick bank loan. People called it Little Chicago, and local politics were served up Capone-style. Migrant farmers, too late to cash in on the wheat boom, roamed the Great Plains with collapsible houses from Sears. The stock market had crashed and liquor had been outlawed; work was impossible to find.

Most of HIS SMOKE, HER ROSES takes place on Main St., where the lustrous gold entrance of the city bank rivals the dark doorway of Willy's Perfumery, a bootlegging front trimmed with small, black hearts. The street's art deco look suggests the city's innocence, but the purity is soon spoiled by a local government of Capone Gang throwbacks.

This story explores the believability of surfaces and appearances, focusing on the annihilation of one of the city's finest families, the Mann family. Owners of the once-leading pharmacy in Kansas City, the Manns have refused to supply the mob with legally obtained alcohol.

The nineteen-year-old daughter, Carthage Mann, appears unaware of danger but keeps track of every detail. She's a luminescent platinum blonde, all at once ethereal, honest, sensual, and reserved. Two men and a woman vie for her love: a reputable bank vice president, a seductive mobster twice her age, and the lesbian numbers specialist for the mob. Carthage appears in classically balanced settings protected by luminous sunlight. In contrast, Willy, the emotionally disturbed mobster, sneaks around in shadows and asymmetry. As he gradually influences Carthage, she is torn in a visual war between light and dark.

As her relationship with mysterious Frances develops, Carthage gains more clarity about her situation and the evil forces involved. Through Frances, Carthage is able to take actions that ultimately save her own life. In return, she teaches Frances that her options are many, not just the roles of victim or persecutor. In a town where female power is grossly underestimated, these women take all and save themselves in the process.

The characters' hidden selves contrast sharply with their public personas. They examine one another, as though on stage, through Main Street's storefront windows. The mood is dangerous but sensually rich--each character is pulled down by a seductive dream far preferable to reality. This wholesome-looking city conceals a network of criminals for whom love is a deadly joke.

EXT. KANSAS CITY, MO., 1932. LATE FALL -- FIERY SUNSET.

A ferry crosses the Missouri River. On the deck is a carriage drawn by four matched HORSES.

As a favorite Kansas City past time, several FAMILIES in cars park along the river bank watching and pointing at the ferry. KIDS play on the bank with their DOGS.

The silhouette of the popular community leader and political boss, TOM MCNABNEY, strolls the deck and pats his four prize-winning horses. In his fifties, McNabney shows great vitality for life; he mouths a cigar as he surveys his kingdom, Kansas City. The ferry docks.

EXT. DARKENED STREET LEADING TO MANN'S PHARMACY AND THE CITY BANK -- SUNSET.

The carriage, driven by McNabney and followed by McNabney's BODYGUARDS, turns on to the sleepy business district street and heads for the courthouse.

EXT. BANK ACROSS THE STREET -- SUNSET.

MR. FLOWMAN, the bank owner in his late thirties, unlocks the goldtone doors to let some EMPLOYEES out. Flowman is very attractive and authoritative. His employees respect and like him very much. He has a rich, soothing voice.

EXT. DARK STREET -- SUNSET.

Across the street a gun shop is quietly being robbed by WEEPING WILLY, the town's slickest new mobster. Willy, forty years old, a high-strung, well-dressed safecracker, moves very quickly in the shadows.

INT. GUN SHOP -- SUNSET.

Willy cracks the safe and selects a gun from the wall. He bags the money and leaves quietly.

INT. BANK VAULT ROOM -- SUNSET.

Mr. Flowman gently tries to kiss CARTHAGE MANN, a fragile but luminescent blonde bank teller. Carthage, very shy, continues placing stacks of money in the safe. She is all at once angelic, ethereal, honest, mysterious, sensual, and all business. Carthage moves with great tenderness and care in the soft gold light of the vault room. She is very poised for a 19-year-old. Mr. Flowman is in awe of her.

INT. MANN'S PHARMACY -- SUNSET.

Carthage's older brother, DICKY MANN, a handsome, hostile 25-year-old, closes up the barren family store. He counts the few colorful glass bottles of tonic and ointment stacked on the near empty shelves. He lazily swabs the massive oak soda fountain. He sprays some of the newly-invented whipped cream from the soda fountain pump into his mouth. He gazes at a photo of RHONDA, a beautiful, privileged, impenetrable blonde who looks like his sister Carthage. Rhonda has repeatedly shunned Dicky, making him all the more dogged.

He switches off the lights in the store and begins to dig the keys out of his pocket. He is spooked. He hears something fall in the back room and calls out, "Dad? Dad?" He strains to listen then quickly walks back to find a box of envelopes toppled on the floor; he gets angry and gives them a quick kick and walks out of the store muttering, "Damn it." He locks the door and walks down the street towards home. The sign outside is clearly marked, "Mann's Pharmacy."

EXT. BEHIND THE DRUGSTORE -- SUNSET.

Willy nods to his two friends, STUBS and BOB, waiting from him in a car. He climbs into their car with the goods. Willy gets in the back seat, lies down, and cries uncontrollably. His particular brand of neurosis is that he cries hysterically after committing a crime or making love. His two friends are used to this; they roll their eyes at each other. Willy writhes in his own blend of remorse and excitement.

Stubs, the driver, who is missing the ends of his fingers, wears three bold rings. They drive off. The passenger, Bob, in the front seat pops some gum in his mouth and offers it to the others who refuse; he gets in the glove compartment for a hanky for Willy. Bob turns from the front seat to comfort Willy and pat him on the back.

BOB

Jesus Christ, Willy.

Let's drive around for a few minutes. Nobody cracks like you, Willy. Straighten up.

STUBS

He'll get over it. Huh Weeper?

Bob

Boss says you got a big heart, Willy.

Stubs snickers. Bob points to Willy's ice truck ahead. Stubs pulls over and lets them out. Willy has recovered, every now and then gulping in air. He's instantly cool.

Stubs

Boss wants them chickens all over

town. Get them votes.

They notice Dicky walking down the street. The men nod to each other as he passes. Dicky is aloof.

Bob

It's the Mann kid.

Bob, Stubs, and Willy give each other knowing looks.

Stubs

Get goin' guys. I gotta change the books.

Willy lights a cigarette and smokes intensely.

WILLY

See ya tomorrow.

Stubs drives off. Willy and Bob get in his ice truck on the passenger side. The truck is decorated with the slogan, "Vote for a Goat."

EXT. QUIET RUNDOWN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD \-- NIGHT.

Bob parks the ice truck. Willy takes a box of live chickens out of the back and goes from door to door with them. He ends up engaging in a tug-a-war with a DECIMATED WOMAN who wants an extra chicken. He tries to tear the chicken away from her in a gentlemanly fashion.

INT. ICE TRUCK -- NIGHT.

Bob laughs at Willy's awkwardness with the task. A POLICEMAN strolls up to watch the noisy scene. As Willy walks back to the truck, he puts his hand on his forehead and heaves the box of squawking chickens into the back of the truck.

POLICEMAN

You boys think it's right to be out scratching votes?

Bob

Ask the boss.

The Policeman shrugs half-heartedly. They drive off.

Bob

Willy, you're gonna be all right.

You like this town any better than...Uh...

What was it...Chicago? Philly?

Willy

Yeah.

Willy stops the conversation with his cold look.

EXT. MANN FAMILY'S YARD -- NIGHT.

From the truck Willy notices his prospective new girl friend, Carthage Mann, Dicky's younger sister. She's dressed very primly, looking quite radiant and innocent. Her dress is baby blue. She's feeding TWO HUGE IRISH WOLFHOUNDS, Keeper and Companion. She laughs as they lunge up slowly and sensually. She waves shyly at Willy.

INT. ICE TRUCK -- NIGHT.

Willy is intrigued with her but scared of the dogs.

Willy

Stop, stop, stop.

Bob

You're not gonna thump that little girl

after we killed her father, are ya?

Willy wrinkles up his nose. He continues to watch Carthage as they drive past. He is struck in the heart.

EXT. MANN'S YARD -- NIGHT.

Carthage teases the dogs and talks to them. She whistles and they come to her; she puts them back on their chains and goes inside, walking past the HOME FOR SALE sign posted in the yard.

INT. MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

In a state of decline, the Mann's home is still comfortable and even elegant in places, except for Dicky's paintings on the walls. When Carthage enters, her brother Dicky sits at the table set with steaming food. All of her natural excitement is gone once she enters the house. The empty chair at the head of the table draws their attention.

Carthage hangs her purse and jacket on the coat rack, with a characteristically heavy sigh. She strokes her father's jacket and looks at his handsome portrait. Her father, Mr. Mann, has been missing without a clue for 6 months.

MRS. MANN, overdressed, stands at the bathroom mirror applying more make up. Attractive in her day, Mrs. Mann shows distress about her husband's disappearance. Mrs. Mann is overly "sweet" and ultra feminine; in Thirties' style, she's "all-woman" and very manipulative. As of late, she pressures her son for codeine from the family store, and cannot accept her new financial status of being sunk.

The phone rings. Mrs. Mann runs to it shrieking, hoping to hear from her husband. It's only a friend.

MRS. MANN, on the phone

We were just sitting down. Yes. Fine.

Yes. Every time it rings, I think it's

Richard.

In the living room, Mrs. Mann settles down to make an entrance and tries to appear glowing and fresh. She waits for someone to comment. Carthage sits at the table.

Dicky

You look wonderful, Mother.

She eyes her husband's empty chair at the head of the table.

Mrs. Mann

Oh Dicky, that's so kind.

Prayer.

They silently bow their heads for a second then begin the meal. Being Catholic, they end the prayer with the sign of the cross. There is a great deal of tension at the table as they begin passing the meat, potatoes, and corn. Dicky speaks to Carthage; he constantly digs at her.

Dicky

I wish you'd feed the dogs after we eat.

Mrs. Mann

Yes, dear, it wouldn't hurt if you waited to feed the dogs after we eat. Dogs are not as important as people; people should eat before dogs. Understand?

CARTHAGE

Dogs are better than people.

Dicky bends his fork into a loop. Mrs. Mann sets her fork beside her plate and freezes.

Mrs. Mann

Now stop it. We didn't act like this when Dad was here. Shame. Shame. Carthage, get Dicky another spoon.

Dicky

Fork.

Carthage begrudgingly goes to the buffet, gets a fork, and considers stabbing Dicky in the back. Apart from their ritual sibling hostility, Dicky and Carthage care for each other immensely, although it's not obvious.

Carthage

Pour la joie en famille!!!!

Carthage eyes the globe at her side as Dicky formally begins to speak indirectly to his mother. In the middle of his speech Carthage closes her eyes and spins the globe. She's getting ready to stop the globe with one finger.

Dicky

It's not like I want you to do someone

else's dirty laundry, but maybe sewing, or canning. Mrs. Owens makes soap now. No shame in that. Better than ending up in a filthy Hooverville.

Mrs. Mann

That's enough, thank you, Dick.

Your father would be appalled.

Dicky

Say, are you ready for a Democrat in the Whitehouse?

Carthage stops the globe with her one finger. She appears distracted, haunted, very deep in thought.

Mrs. Mann, to Carthage

Dear, you really ought to marry Flow.

He was the only one smart enough to get

out before the crash. Any woman in town would be proud.

INT. CARTHAGE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Upstairs in her map-covered bedroom, Carthage flips through fashion magazines. She can hear the bathtub water running. She hears her mother softly call "Carthage." She stops to look at her prized possession, the Ansel Adams photograph "Monolith, the Face of Half Dome," a gift from her father for her sixteenth birthday.

FLASHBACK THREE YEARS. INT. MANN LIVINGROOM \-- NIGHT.

After Carthage's sixteenth birthday party, the floors are cluttered with confetti and streamers. The guests have gone home. Carthage and her FATHER sit on the sofa in deep conversation. She holds the new print unrolled in her lap. Carthage looks very tender and trusting. We can see only the back of her father.

Carthage

Why did you give this to me?

What does it mean, Dad?

FATHER

It means going against the grain

when you know you're right. It means standing firm in what you believe, at any cost. That way you'll never have any regrets. Integrity, it's the only thing worth having.

BACK TO PRESENT TIME. INT. MRS. MANN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

In her mother's bedroom, Carthage finds her mother in a revealing nightgown, sneaking sleeping pills and removing her makeup at the bureau mirror. She "cheats" as she does the rosary of Hail Mary's, while doing everything else and muttering it softly under her breath. Mrs. Mann is not one to suffer anything, especially the boredom of repetitious prayers.

Carthage begins to undo her mother's hair, combing it down into a long flow. After Mrs. Mann removes her makeup, she puts on lipstick again.

Mrs. Mann

You have a sixth sense about these things,

Carthage. Is he coming back? Is your

father alive?

Carthage,

Mama, Dicky's mean to me.

Mrs. Mann

Honey, he needs your France money.

That's all we have left.

Carthage

Mama, I said no.

EXT. DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY -- DAY

Taxis, LaSalles, DeSotos, Model A's, and T's putter around. Banners of red, white, and blue are strewn around Liberty Memorial. In the distance a band plays the Democrats' win song, "Happy Days are Here Again." A ragged UNEMPLOYED MAN holds up a sign that says "Unemployed. Apples 5 Cents."

Carthage buys an apple and chats with the man. She walks very tall and proud. Ahead of her, she sees Tom McNabney riding through the streets on his carriage drawn by four horses. The carriage is decorated with signs that say, "Vote for a Goat." PEOPLE admire him and crowd toward him.

McNabney in white gloves, and tux and tails waves to everyone. He smiles and waves to Carthage; she waves back. Then he throws nickels to some LITTLE BOYS. He lifts a BABY out of a MOTHER'S arms and kisses it. The mother is appreciative. Behind him come two more carriages filled with well-dressed BODYGUARDS.

Willy stands among them in a spiffy suit and fedora -- the works. He sees Carthage and tries to hide. The carriage stops at the monument, where all the men, including McNabney, climb out and walk into the courthouse. This group of DISTINGUISHED MEN has everyone's attention.

INT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY

Carthage jostles into the crowded cafe across the street. WAITRESSES in frilly pink frocks busily take orders. Carthage orders a cup of coffee from MABEL. Mabel, also nineteen, is very interested in her old friend Carthage, but Carthage is fascinated with the men going up the courthouse steps. She sees Willy split off from the pack and go his own way. Willy is very careful about not being seen with the mob.

MABEL

Say, you really going to marry Flowman?

You never want to talk anymore.

Carthage notices Willy lingering to talk to McNabney's well-dressed girlfriend LATICIA and his elegant numbers specialist FRANCES on the courthouse steps.

In her forties, Frances is a handsome, experienced woman. She has jet black hair and wears a stylish red suit trimmed in fox.

Carthage strains to read their lips. She is especially caught by Frances, the elegant, aloof one. Willy is very sure of himself among the ladies.

Carthage sees her mother walking down the street to her car. They exchange intimate, little waves.

INT. COURTHOUSE -- DAY.

The group of men files into the courtroom where McNabney, a charismatic, farm boy-made-good waits for silence. After years of campaigning, McNabney's face is frozen in a perpetual smile--only his eyes change expression. He sees himself as a robust politician, not a mobster. McNabney's oral fixation is satisfied, in part, by a fetish for the newly-invented Tollhouse cookie.

When McNabney isn't savoring a cookie, he rolls up his tie all the way to his mouth, sucks the tip of it, then drops it and watches it quickly unroll down his belly. All his people, except Willy, are used to this nasty habit, which is totally unconscious.

Laticia, McNabney's impeccably dressed companion, sits behind him and brushes his collar. He smiles at her and winks. She hands him several cookies.

In her Thirties' power suit, Frances sits coolly in a corner by herself. Laticia has a look of faked innocence and denial about her involvement with this group of well-dressed gangsters; Frances, however, is fully conscious of her role.

A SECRETARY delivers a tray of coffee and a platter of Tollhouse cookies.

The men take their seats, as they finish up their chuckling from outside. The group consists of Stubs and Bob, whom we have seen before, as well as CHOWDER -- a small man wearing thick glasses and chain smoking, HERMAN and SHERMAN -- a pair of identical Swedish twins, the FOOD KING, the BOOZE KING, and FRITZ \-- the gun man, a lone professional shooter who turns his chair to the side and wears sunglasses.

Willy is the youngest and the most stylish of the group. He walks in last by himself. He has a special flair and a magnetism that no one else has. He's very cool and confident, sitting next to McNabney.

MCNABNEY

Did a great job keeping us out of the paper. Special thanks to Chowder for that. Now that we've won the election, I want Willy to be my perfume king. Put ya' in the old haberdashery. Divert most of your stuff to the Boozer. Make them perfumes, hair tonics, colognes, whatever you want out of the rest. All the drugstores in Missouri are playing since the unfortunate disappearance of the good Mr. Mann. Everybody pays, of course. What do you say, Willy? You like Kansas City? You want to stay?

Willy

I'm very grateful, sir.

McNabney

Anything else? Oh Chowder, take care of

the details. Mann's pharmacy is dried up, father and son. They never understood teamwork, the essence of America.

McNabney leans toward Willy, lowering his voice and bringing a pistol from his lap.

McNabney

How long has it been for you? Seriously.

Ya gettin' lonely?

The group chuckles. The men don't approve of McNabney's personal questions but they tolerate his indelicate manner.

Willy, blushing, coughing

Well, sir.

Group laughter. Frances is truly offended; Laticia becomes unconvincingly smug.

McNabney

You want some girls tonight?

Would you like that? Stubs, take

care of my horses.

FRANCES

They're not girls; they're prostitutes.

McNabney

That's right. Frances is exacting. And she also likes girls. That's why I trust her.

Stubs

Now we got two crybabies, Willy and Frances!

Group laughter.

McNabney

Now don't tease him. Willy's special.

So is Frances. Whad'ya say Weeper?

Bob

Eat shit, Weeper.

Group laughter. Willy shrugs his shoulders.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS -- DAY.

Laticia sides up to Willy. They walk down the court steps together. Willy tries to get away but can't. The other men tease them. Fritz never smiles or says anything. Frances is remote; she slips into a cab and disappears.

Willy hurriedly assists Laticia onto the carriage along with the others, then he notices Carthage in the cafe, who quickly buries her head in her book, pretending not to see him. She's jealous.

As Willy nods goodbye to his group, Laticia tries to drag him off with the moving carriage. He breaks her grip, straightens his jacket, and saunters into the cafe.

INT. THE CAFE -- DAY.

Carthage reads, pretending to ignore Willy. He sits in the booth behind her. Mabel brings him a cup of coffee; he throws down a dollar tip for her and slides up to Carthage's booth. Mabel is impressed and envious of Carthage.

Willy

Hello, Miss Mann. May I sit down?

Carthage is truly terrified and excited by his sexual presence.

Carthage

I didn't see you.

Willy sits down and looks deep into her eyes very sincerely, and speaks without a hint of sarcasm.

Willy

Now why is it that a woman will pretend that

she doesn't see you when you know damn well

she does?

Carthage is taken aback and starts to answer when Willy continues.

Willy

More French? Impressive.

Carthage nods yes.

Willy

Carthage, ain't that a name from the Bible?

Carthage

It was a great city from antiquity...

Carthage sees her mother driving past the window. Again, they exchange waves. Mrs. Mann looks high as a kite. Willy realizes he is out-classed and puffs himself up to compensate.

Willy

Antiquity? Geesh. Gimmee that book.

Carthage nervously hands him the book and he clears his throat. He can't read a word of French, but tries anyway to make Carthage laugh. With great sincerity, he begins to brazenly slaughter the language.

Willy,

L'autre jour, au fond d'un vallon, un serpentpiqua jean freron. Que pensez-vous qu'il arriva? Ce fut le serpent qui creva.

Carthage is at first horrified at his nasal, Texan-like French. When she starts laughing, he quits reading and joins her. He slaps the book back to her side of the table. Willy is taken aback by her hearty laugh and momentarily relaxed appearance.

Willy

What am I reading?

Carthage knocks over her coffee and dies a million deaths.

Carthage

You were reading Pascal.

He says we are capable of neither goodness nor truth.

I can't believe that, can you?

Willy grabs her by the hand.

Willy

I can't believe you read this stuff.

Carthage gasps. He lets go of her hand.

Willy

Hey, come see how my new shop's coming along.

You work at the bank, right?

Carthage studies him as they walk out. Mabel croons to get a peek of her old friend Carthage who has changed so much.

EXT. STREET -- DARK AFTERNOON.

Willy and Carthage go out to his grasshopper-green Cadillac roadster. The afternoon is stormy.

They slowly drive past Willy's new shop which is the old Truman Haberdashery undergoing renovation. Willy waves to the WORKING MEN. A placard in his shop window reads, "Perfume Shop Coming Soon -- Grand Opening to be Announced."

Willy reaches for the wine bottles on the back seat.

Willy

Plum wine. I made it myself.

Carthage

I only have wine at communion.

Instantly determined to get her drunk, Willy flutters his eyelashes charmingly.

Willy

Really?

EXT. MANN'S HOME -- DARK AFTERNOON.

Willy pulls up to her house.

Through the large picture window, Carthage can see silhouettes of her mother and Dicky arguing. She's embarrassed. Once again Dicky's carrying the record book and referring to it. Dicky adamantly points to his book. The house forebodes hell.

Carthage

They're always arguing, since my father...

Want to?

Willy

Want to what?

Carthage

Take communion?

The car roars away from the house. Willy points to the bottle of wine. Carthage removes the cork.

Carthage

Where are the glasses?

Willy gives her a funny look. Willy warms up to Carthage.

It begins to snow.

Carthage hands Willy the bottle of wine. He carefully sniffs it and fully savors the first sip. He then tucks the bottle between his legs.

The headlights rushing through the snow create a dizzying effect. There is a very clear difference in the way Willy and Carthage drink. She's a little sloppy; he's prim and proper.

Willy

Cheers!

A Gershwin tune comes over the air, "Rhapsody in Blue." Willy knows it very well and hums along with it machine gun style, aggressively mouthing "do-do-do" and "da-da-da." The music makes him very emotional. Carthage is intrigued, with his half-yelling style of singing. She takes the wine from between his legs -- he looks at her in surprise. She smiles innocently. Willy sings louder. She laughs. He really starts hamming it up. She tilts the bottle up as far as it will go and drinks it dry. She rolls down a window and throws the bottle out, smashing it on a tree. Willy is shocked but pleased with her. To himself he mutters, "My god!"

Carthage notices a snow-covered hill and yells, "Stop!" Willy screeches to a halt.

She scrambles out of the car and runs up the hill. Willy follows her, rubbing his hands together in delight. This is the first time Carthage has enjoyed herself since her father's disappearance. Willy carries another bottle of wine and begins to yip. Carthage yips back in the distance. The cold, beautiful night invigorates them and they play like children full of joy and craziness. The yipping sounds like a mysterious mating call.

Willy catches up with her in a rocky place that shelters them from the wind. They look down over all the lights of town through the soft and fast snow. The night sky is indigo. Carthage wiggles into Willy's side. He holds her tightly with one arm and bites the cork out of the new bottle and spits it out. He turns it up and drinks. He holds the bottle way above Carthage's mouth and pours some in. She chokes a little and begins to laugh hysterically. He almost kisses her but she begins to talk incoherently.

Carthage

Every day I get in deeper.

First it was the Lindbergh boy.

Willy takes another drink and pours more in her mouth. He accidentally spills wine on the snow. Carthage bellies down to the ground and laps it up. Her freedom turns Willy on. He tries to pull her out of the snow but she wants to stay there and eat the rest. He kneels beside her and turns her head up so that he can kiss her. She pushes him away. Willy starts groaning. He hams it up, stumbling around.

Willy

You're not a kid.

Carthage stands, too, and brushes off her clothes. She notices the train coming through the valley five miles below them.

She grows wistful and melodramatic.

Carthage

Look, look! Here it is!! Here to Chicago,

Chicago to New York. Once you get on a train

you're free....

He holds Carthage's hand until she breaks into a run down the hill. By the time Carthage reaches the bottom of the snowy hill she is crying. Willy leads her to the car. They get in. Willy holds her tightly as he observes her weeping.

Willy

What is it, Precious?

Carthage wails like a three-year-old.

Carthage

I want my father...

Willy gives her a little shake, wanting to avoid the topic.

Willy

You're strong. You're a very strong

girl. You're going to be just fine.

He wipes her tears away -- she lightens up.

He kisses her delicately.

Willy

How long have you worked at the bank?

Carthage

Three years.

Willy turns on the car to keep warm. Carthage wipes her tears away.

Willy

I like it when you cry.

Willy smiles to himself.

Willy

Your boss must trust you.

Carthage

Flowman, yeah.

Willy pulls the flask out of the glove compartment and hands it to Carthage.

Carthage

Where do you get this? Is it wood or grain?

Willy

Jesus, what do you think I am? I wouldn't give you wood alcohol. It'll blind you.

Willy is sincerely pissed off at the insulting question. Carthage swoons; she's quite drunk. She starts singing "THE MAN I LOVE" at the top of her lungs. Willy rolls his eyes.

EXT. MANN HOUSE - NIGHT.

Willy takes Carthage home. She closes her eyes and waits to be kissed. Willy passes and shakes his head "NO" when she opens her eyes.

Willy

Goodnight, Carthage.

Carthage sadly gets out of the car and weaves into the house. He watches her and waits till she gets in past the dogs. He gets a threatening look across his face and slams his gloved fist on the dash. Keeper and Companion briskly walk the fence and growl at his car. He drives off.

INT. MANN HOUSE -- NIGHT.

Inside her house, Carthage weaves upstairs, turning out the light left on for her.

Her mother calls out dreamily, "Carthage, Carthage, is that you?"

Carthage

Yes, Mama.

Mrs. Mann

You missed mass...

Carthage, hicupping

No, I didn't.

Carthage goes to her bedroom and crawls in bed with her clothes on. Dicky comes in her room as she falls asleep and stands looking at her tenderly.

INT. MANN HOME - DAY.

The next morning Carthage wakes in her clothes with a rosary held tightly in her hands. She has a bad headache. She slowly undresses and finds that her bra is half-emptied of tissue. She pats herself to make sure. She is mortified as she remembers what she did her the night before. Holding her head, she goes to the bathroom.

Carthage comes down to breakfast where Dicky paces apprehensively. Dicky studies the newspaper. Mrs. Mann carries food to the table.

Dicky

Where were you last night?

Carthage

Revens: c'est l'heure.

Dicky

Where were you?

Carthage

You are not my father.

Mrs. Mann is enjoying squirting the newly-invented canned whipped cream on pancakes. She laughs with delight.

Mrs. Mann

This is the best breakfast I have ever made!

Pancakes, ham, eggs, grits...Something good is going to happen today.

Dicky holds up the newspaper headline that reads, "Mann Kills Himself.'

Dicky

Look at this. Disrespect, that's what it is. Bad stock, my ass.

Mrs. Mann ignores her children; she is thoroughly caught up in her thoughts.

Dicky marches upstairs. Carthage studies her mother.

Mrs. Mann has put mountains of food on the table -- way too much for the family -- and sits down to eat.

Dicky walks through and gives her a small bag containing drugs. As Mrs. Mann begins to speak he slams the front door.

Mrs. Mann

Dicky, whatcha you gonna do for

breakfast...

EXT. DOWNTOWN -- MORNING.

Dicky walks downtown past the cafe across from his store. Several PEOPLE sit having coffee, reading the morning paper whose headline reads "MANN KILLS HIMSELF."

Willy sits in his shop window studying the article. He watches Dicky who is suffering. Dicky notices Willy's sympathetic looks and nods to him. Dicky respectfully nods to those who tip their hats.

WORKMEN stand around Willy nailing up the shop's decor. They are hammering small black hearts to border a wall; the hearts overlap so as not to appear, on first impression, as hearts.

Dicky unlocks his store and goes inside; he looks out the front window and writes in his record book -- he is thinking very hard. Willy leaves his own shop.

INT. MANN HOME -- DAY.

Back at the Mann home, Mrs. Mann sits in a daze amid the piles of food, drinking coffee. When the phone rings, she jumps for it. Again, it's just a friend.

Carthage walks wrapped in a towel as she goes upstairs. The dogs bark. Carthage watches from an upstairs window.

EXT. MANN YARD -- DAY.

Outside the gate, Willy fussily takes a dozen white roses out of their box and arranges them in tissue. He straightens his suit and tie.

INT. MANN HOME -- DAY.

Carthage, unaware of herself, draws closer to the window in her towel. She watches as Mrs. Mann politely but resolutely refuses the roses. Willy hands a single rose to Mrs. Mann. As he hands it to her, he looks up and sees Carthage in the window. Carthage jumps out of his sight and looks at herself in the mirror. When she peeks out again, Willy is down the street carrying the roses; he lobs them in the nearest open trash can.

Downstairs Mrs. Mann puts the rose in a bud vase, and goes back to the table of cold food. Carthage comes downstairs, ready for work. She's prim, proper, and lustrous once again.

Mrs. Mann

Mr. Trezona brought some roses by, and

said he was sorry about your father, and

I said that daddy isn't dead. And he

said well could he leave one for you,

and I said you were in the bathtub.

Carthage gently takes the rose from the vase and leaves for work muttering, "Bye, Mama."

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Carthage, on her way to the bank, walks past the trash can where the other roses are and lobs hers in. She can't resist inhaling their fragrance.

Willy notices Carthage from his store window: She is greeted warmly by Mr. Flowman at the bank entrance.

Willy sees Dicky in the pharmacy window working on his record book. Dicky gives a half-smile and Willy walks over.

INT. MANN'S PHARMACY -- DAY.

In the store, the two men talk. Customers walk around.

Willy

I sent your family flowers.

Dicky

Nice, Willy, but the story wasn't

true. Something isn't right here.

Willy

Your old man keep neat books?

Dicky

Yeah, yeah. He wrote the check but didn't get the goods. And my license is on hold by local politicians.

Dicky notices the stylish, icy blonde, RHONDA, walking past the store. She's almost a carbon copy of Carthage. He's captivated. She ignores him as he weakly waves. Dicky is crestfallen over Rhonda.

Willy

Maybe they were choking him. Did he pay

protection?

Dicky

Look, he isn't in that crowd. Maybe you are?

Willy

Swapping chickens for votes. That's no crime. Say, your sister is one hell of a beauty.

Dicky

Don't even think about it.

Willy walks out, going to his perfumery.

An OLD MAN wheezes and coughs. Dicky resents the persistent old guy.

Dicky

Mr. Baxter, I have ordered your pills.

They'll be here any day. I'm very sorry.

The Old Man turns around and says to the WOMAN CUSTOMER behind him:

OLD MAN

I've been getting my pills here for

twenty years...

The woman waits as Dicky searches for something in back. She taps her purse in a very dainty fashion.

WOMAN CUSTOMER

I don't see any Benjamin's on the shelf...

Dicky

No ma'am, we're out of Benjamin's.

Could I recommend another?

Woman

No, thank you, Mr. Mann.

The Old Man totters off. A YOUNGSTER waves at the soda fountain for service.

YOUNGSTER

Hey mister, I wanna soda.

DICKY

Okay, okay.

INT. BANK -- DAY.

Carthage sits at an adding machine checking numbers. Flowman sits with a poor migrant FARMER and his WIFE and TWO SMALL CHILDREN. The family is completely ragged, dirty, and despairing, as in a Dorothea Lange photo. The farmer has just asked for a loan. Mr. Flowman is beside himself with the request because he feels so much compassion.

Flowman

Do you have any collateral whatsoever?

The farmer and his wife stare blankly at each; they don't know what collateral means.

Flowman

I can't give you a loan, but

I could use some help at home,

if you're interested.

FARMER

Most grateful, sir.

The clock strikes noon. Carthage is moved by Flowman's sweetness. She puts a hand on his shoulder and looks at him in an admiring way. The farmer and his wife look at Carthage as if she were a vision from heaven.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Carthage wanders out eating a sandwich and goes to a small Catholic church in the neighborhood. She must walk through clotheslines full of sheets snapping in the cold wind to get there.

INT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY.

Carthage looks longingly into the flames of the prayer votives. She replays all the craziness in her mind. Upon leaving, she recognizes Frances sitting in a dark corner.

Carthage wants to introduce herself but walks away quickly to give Frances privacy. Frances looks gratefully and determinedly ahead at first, then very lonely once Carthage is out of view.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Carthage wanders to Willy's Grand Opening, where WOMEN come in the front door to buy exotic perfumes, and MEN go to the back door for booze. She watches Willy through his large front window.

INT. WILLY'S SHOP -- DAY.

Inside Willy's shop the Grand Opening takes place. The shop is decorated in art deco. An easel bears the sign "Grand Opening -- Free Service to Ladies."

The art deco styled shop's main motif is small black valentines and sharp lines that round at the corners. The walls, except for their black borders, are painted ivory. Willy has mirrors and ferns around him. He sits enclosed much like a priest in a glass counter.

Willy talks with a large, PUSHY WOMAN who is infatuated with him; she is upper crust.

PUSHY WOMAN

I want him to stop and say,

"There goes the woman of my life?"

Willy is stumped.

Willy walks back to the stock room losing his temper. Bob is carefully screening customers at the back door. Willy quickly sells a bottle of whiskey to a BUM.

He then grabs a bottle of perfume out of a box and bites his tongue. Magically transformed, he greets her again with the perfume. Several other LADIES have wandered in. Carthage still stands at the window, looking in. She is amazed at Willy's grace and finesse.

Willy, to the crowd

In a few minutes ladies, I'll take

you over here.

Willy notices Carthage watching his show and becomes sheepish. She smiles vacantly and walks back down the street to the pharmacy.

EXT. ALLEY -- DAY.

Behind the perfume shop in the alley, Stubs drives up with Fritz.

INT. WILLY'S SHOP -- DAY.

They go in the back door of Willy's shop. Willy hears them and finishes his speech.

Willy -- VOICE-OVER

It will work its way into your voice, your walk. Henry will then see all of your charms. Mrs. Sherman, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Mrs. Sherman pays him.

Willy hurries back to the stock room and greets the men by pointing to the barrels of grain alcohol. Fritz pours a little out of the spigot and lights it with a match. It readily ignites. The large flame scares Willy.

Willy hears the front door bell ringing and hurries back to the ladies.

Fritz and Stubs finish delivering the large barrels.

Next, Stubs backs the truck around to Dicky's back door. The men enter his shop.

INT. MANN'S PHARMACY -- DAY.

Dicky stands near the front with his mortar and pestle, stirring up a concoction. He looks out the window and sees Carthage visiting with the waitress Mabel in the cafe across the street. When Dicky hears the back door open, he walks back to meet Stubs and Fritz both wearing masks.

Dicky

May I help you?

Stubs

Yes, I was paying Richard Mann my respects.

Sorry to hear he gaffed himself.

Dicky

He didn't. He disappeared.

What do you want??

Stubs

We had a nice arrangement. He would want

you to do the same.

Fritz rolls the baseball bat in his hands.

Dicky

Get the hell out before I

call the cops and the Star.

Stubs

And the ambulance.

Dicky

Just get the hell out.

Stubs

Other stores give us half of their

legally obtained potions -- for a good price. And we'll protect you, kid.

Dicky

Not interested.

Carthage enters the front door and calls out, "Dicky?"

Stubs

We'll be back.

Fritz smashes a few bottles with his bat.

The men quickly leave; Dicky runs to the back window to get a glimpse of their car but he misses them. Carthage enters.

Dicky

Go back to work.

Carthage

Who was that? What happened?

Dicky

Nobody. Where were ya last night? Look,

I've got to have some money so I

can re-order. Where were you last night?

Carthage

A friend.

Dicky

And by the way, I'm not filling mother's

prescriptions anymore.

Carthage inspects the once-magnificent soda fountain. It's filthy.

Carthage

Dicky.

Dicky

Get away from there. I can handle it.

Carthage

I could help you at night. I could

quit my job.

Dicky

Carthage, you're just a girl so please get lost, then do me a favor. Tell your honey I need some money.

Carthage leaves.

Dicky is in a muddle. He picks up the phone and puts it down; he repeats this action twice again. He doesn't know who to call. He races to look out the back door window and sees no one. He looks at a tattered little photo of Rhonda in his wallet.

EXT. ALLEY -- DAY.

He runs to Willy's back door and pounds on it. No one answers.

INT. PHARMACY -- DAY.

He goes back in his own store and begins to sweep up the glass.

INT. THE BANK -- DAY.

Carthage and Flowman talk in his glassed-in office. Willy watches them as he makes a large deposit with another teller.

Inside Flowman's office, Carthage and Flowman talk.

FLOWMAN

I can't loan him anymore money, sweetheart.

He's got to sell.

Carthage

He wants my France money.

Flowman

Don't give it to him. He doesn't have a

head for business.

Carthage

I know you're right. But he's my brother.

Flowman

I want you to go home and rest. You're

upset. Go for a drive later?

Carthage shakes her head yes.

As Carthage leaves, the other TELLERS gossip viciously.

EXTERIOR STREET -- DAY.

Outside Carthage catches up with Willy who is only a few steps ahead of her.

Carthage

I'm sorry about the other night. I've never

done that before...

Willy

It's all right.

They've arrived at Willy's store; they keep walking; they see Dicky inside his store as usual. Carthage hurries off.

Willy

Meet me here at 8:00.

Carthage nods no.

Willy

I'm coming over then.

Carthage brushes him off.

Willy, the pathological but sensitive liar, knocks on Dicky's store window. Dicky is relieved to see him and comes to unlock the door.

INT. PHARMACY -- DAY.

Willy

Hey, Dicky, I been tellin' these broads to

come over here. You can't just lock up in

the middle of the day.

Willy looks at the mess.

Dicky

Some thugs threatened me. They said not

to call the police or the paper, so I

didn't. I didn't know who to call.

Willy

Listen, just give 'em whatever they want.

Your life's not worth it.

EXT. WILLY'S HOTEL -- NIGHT.

Willy rooms at an old hotel called Hotel Celeste. The elegant sign outside features a green palm tree, promising something exotic inside. The lit-up palm tree sign looks humorous through the falling snow.

INT. WILLY'S ROOM -- NIGHT.

His room is a total wreck, -- ties on the floor, cat dishes, bottles and barrels for homemade wine, old newspapers, torn-apart clocks, all kinds of combination locks -- his THREE CATS greet him. He pets them vigorously.

He keeps a COLONY OF ANTS running up and down the sideboard of a door by the red garbage can where he has placed a small dish of honey. The ants scurry down to get the honey, and back up to a hole in the top of the door's cement. He quickly appraises their work for the day and uses his Zippo lighter on each one that strays off the path. He deeply concentrates as he torches them.

INT. MANN'S HOME -- DAY.

Dressed in glamorous evening attire with no place to go, Mrs. Mann sings a light dance tune along with the radio as she sways through the living room. The family is playing the new game Monopoly. Carthage has all the money on her side. She also plays the bank. For the first time, Dicky sits in his father's chair with the accounting books at his side. Carthage and Dicky ignore their mother.

Carthage, shaking the dice

Sixty days. Mom, I'm throwing for you.

Mrs. Mann, calling out

Daddy wants her to go to France.

Dicky

We aren't who we used to be.

Ha. Ha. Luxury tax, Mom. $75.00.

Mrs. Mann

That's it. I quit.

Mrs. Mann sings louder and glides upstairs Cleopatra style. Carthage rolls her eyes.

Dicky

Carthage, you'll get every cent of it back. I'm not going to be ruined by these crooks. I've got to keep on the level...for Dad.

Carthage

What would be so bad about selling

some hootch? Stop them from

ruining the store.

Dicky is truly astonished with her.

Dicky

Hootch?

Carthage

I wasn't saying you should change.

Just look at their rules. I don't want

you to disappear too.

Dicky is exasperated with his sister's newfound dark side.

He is genuinely concerned. Dicky gets up to turn down the radio.

Dicky

Where do you get this stuff?

Carthage slips Dicky a couple of bills out of the bank as he turns his back.

Carthage

Sixty days.

Dicky

A little stiff, don't you think?

Carthage

You got a short-term, high-risk loan.

Dicky

God help me.

Carthage

Let me see your book.

Dicky

Nope, it's my store. Hey, where you going?

Dicky thumbs through his play money and suspects his sister's generosity. He likes it, but it humiliates him a little.

EXT. MANN'S YARD -- NIGHT.

The Irish Wolfhounds run around on their chains, scaring Willy who is snooping around. Carthage comes outside holding a dish of food for the dogs.

The Star PHOTOGRAPHER parks behind the family's car. He sneaks up on Carthage and frightens her. The photographer flashes a bulb on her. Carthage is scared then furious. She throws the plate of scraps at him and hits him square in the back. Suddenly, Willy intervenes.

Willy

What the hell are you doing?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Just making the news. Name please?

Carthage

Get out of here you filthy liar!

Willy laughs explosively. The antsy photographer drives away. Carthage is shrieking and laughing at Willy's gentlemanly fight movements.

Remembering her jealous brother inside, Carthage is afraid to be seen with Willy.

Carthage

Go away.

Willy

C'mon. Get in. I love the way

you decked him!

She quickly gets in and they drive to Hotel Celeste.

INT. WILLY'S CAR -- NIGHT.

Willy

You gotta watch these reporters, now

that your family's big in the news.

They'll eat you alive.

Carthage

I thought you said dinner.

Willy

I did.

EXT. HOTEL CELESTE -- NIGHT.

They get out at his hotel and climb the stairs. He expertly spins the combination lock on his door; his room is now spotless. Carthage is shocked at the idea of being alone with an older man.

INT. WILLY'S ROOM -- NIGHT.

He has a bottle of wine on the table with two wine glasses and a candle that's burning. Carthage smiles and gets nervous. Willy invites her to sit. She refuses. The cats run in around their feet. Carthage is intrigued but afraid. She peels an orange. Willy has no intention of touching this young, perfect girl. He opens the wine. Carthage blanches at the thought of drinking wine again.

Willy

Made this from strawberries. These are my cats, of course... Carthage, why are you here? Why are you here with me? What do you think will happen? You don't think nothing is going to happen, do you? I suppose you want to be my friend.

He pours the wine.

Carthage

I don't know.

The tension is unbearable.

Carthage bursts into laughter. Willy laughs too. They drink wine. Carthage is nervous; Willy self-assured and seductive.

Willy reaches for her hand and then withdraws. He sees Carthage as a safe he must crack with the right combination of moves and words.

Carthage pours herself another glass of wine and drinks the whole thing like medicine. She becomes falsely confident.

Carthage

I want to grow up. I want to know about love.

Carthage silently chastises herself. She doesn't even recognize her own voice.

Willy

Love? Good heavens.

Carthage has an embarrassed look on her face, and shakes her head earnestly.

Willy turns his chair towards her so that their knees are almost touching. He takes the orange from her and finishes peeling it, then feeds her sections of it slowly.

Carthage

I'm being promoted. At the bank.

This cracks Willy up. He laughs and whispers, "SSSHHH."

Willy

Filching a man's job.

Carthage

But my brother needs me.

Willy is grooving on the moment. Carthage is out of control. Willy lights a cigarette. A tear glistens in his eye.

Willy

SSSHHH.....

Carthage

What does that mean?

Willy

Business is business. Don't do any favors.

Carthage

Do you know my father?

Willy

No. No. Of course not. I'm a business

man.

Carthage

So was he. Kansas City's

finest.

Willy is exasperated that Carthage keeps talking. She makes him laugh.

Willy

SSSHHH....

Carthage blushes. She feels shy in the presence of an older man.

Willy

Oh my God, the meatloaf.

Willy rushes to the oven to rescue the meatloaf. He flings it out on the table and burns his hand.

Carthage wraps up in her coat and comes over to the table where Willy fussily fixes their plates of meatloaf and potatoes.

Carthage is amused. Willy kisses her cheek, but he will not be aggressive toward her. They silently stare at each other, more puzzled than ever.

Carthage

Were you crying?

Willy

I get very happy.

Carthage, eating

I spose you want to get married now.

Willy thinks this is hysterically funny. He notices her key chain sticking out of her purse. He fingers it and digs for information.

Willy

This must be the bank key?

Carthage

I don't have one.

Willy

Betcha get one, when ya get that big promotion.

Carthage doesn't like being made fun of; she gets up abruptly.

Carthage

Goodnight.

She waits for him to slow her down. He doesn't.

Willy

Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

Willy lets Carthage go. He ignores her as she leaves. She looks back, wondering what is going on. The cats meow and run to the plate on the floor.

EXT. MANN YARD -- NIGHT.

Carthage ascends the porch steps and cautiously peeks through a window to see whether Dick is waiting for her. She pats the dogs.

INT. MANN HOUSE -- NIGHT.

She hurries to her bedroom and locks the door. As she drifts off to sleep, Dicky quickly knocks on her door with his fist. Carthage ignores him and he goes away.

EXT. WILLY'S STORE -- DAY.

Willy pounds his fist down in a jealous temper tantrum. He is watching Mr. Flowman, the attractive vice president of the bank, open the bank door for Carthage. When he sees them laughing and talking excitedly, Willy understands why Carthage is being promoted. He also observes that Flowman is a real gentleman and good in his heart.

Carthage goes her separate way down the street.

Willy can hardly keep his concentration on his present customer, MRS. FROXEN, a pompous, bejeweled woman.

INT. WILLY'S STORE -- DAY.

Willy sits at his booth enjoying the ladies' reaction to his seductive, insincere selling.

Willy

No mere floral scent will do.

Mrs. Froxen crooks an eyebrow; she is intrigued.

MRS. FROXEN

Can I tell you a little secret?

I'd like to star in a circus. I had the "dancing" in mind.

Willy squirts some perfume on her hand. They both sniff it in a snooty way. Willy holds his hand to his heart as if it's too much to bear.

Willy

Yes. Yes.

Mrs. Froxen

William, you're right. Would you put

a little behind my ears?

Willy

My pleasure.

Mrs. Froxen lifts her hair suggestively for the spraying.

Willy

$1.00 please.

EXT. WILLY'S STORE -- DAY.

Carthage gets her nerve up. She enters the store with mock confidence. Willy, in the midst of his show, breaks off to talk to her in a corner. WELL-TO-DO WOMEN mill about.

Confused and humiliated by their previous encounter, Carthage angrily approaches Willy. Willy teases a petite, SELF-CONSCIOUS WOMAN.

Willy

Let's see. You look like a, uh, flamethrower. Yes!

The woman nods yes. Carthage is there to cause trouble. She speaks loudly.

Carthage

When are you going to rob the bank, Willy?

Willy is shocked at her clear perception of him. He then mocks her with deep, condescending laughter.

Willy

Miss Mann, this is no proper welcome.

The women in the store look surprised then respond to his quick coverup.

Willy verbally twists Carthage's arm.

Willy

Miss Mann, I'm surprised at your sophisticated sense of humor. You seemed like a serious girl in my hotel room.

Carthage is flabbergasted. The women are embarrassed. Willy is satisfied that he has one-upped her. He motions Carthage aside.

Willy

Get the hell out of my store.

Carthage

I can't see you anymore.

Willy

Oh, you come over to see me to tell me

you can't see me anymore. I see.

Willy, dramatizing, clears his throat and strides to the corner of the room to make an announcement. Willy holds up perfume marked TruLove.

Willy

Ladies! True Love is on sale for the rest of the afternoon.

Carthage stomps out of the store. Willy is angry. He goes back to his customers.

INT. COURTHOUSE -- NIGHT.

McNabney holds a meeting with the regulars. He rapidly munches his Tollhouse cookie, a very sexual experience for him. The MAYOR presides and McNabney holds a gavel. He pounds it three times, and begins to affectionately play with a pistol on top of the table. Well-dressed Laticia is at his side, fussing with her hair. The men sit around a table. Frances sits in her corner.

As McNabney begins to speak, he rolls up his silk tie and sticks the tip of it in his mouth. It helps him think.

McNabney

We control these licenses for one reason. To get the product to the speakeasies. We must use all our means -- even though it may reach into our personal lives -- (he looks at Willy) to get alcohol diverted to the right places. The perfume king is doing an exceptional job. And Willy, I understand from our newspaper friends that you have the opportunity to cast influence on Mann's Pharmacy? Is that right?

Willy

Perhaps, sir.

McNabney

Do all you can.

Willy

Yes sir.

McNabney

In other words, you haven't the slightest

desire to help the family... research.

Willy

Of course not, sir.

McNabney

Well good. You know love is a funny

thing. But business is business.

Bob?

Bob

Star took $1000.00 for deletion of term

"baby poisoners" in the milk story.

McNabney

A little high. Fritz, take care of my

horses tonight?

FRITZ

Yessir.

McNabney

Frances?

Frances

Herman, Sherman, how many tickets have

we sold?

HERMAN and SHERMAN, together

872.

Frances

Try for 1500.

McNabney

Did I make any money on the whores?

Frances

Tri-state ring netted about three grand.

McNabney

Does that include Arkansas? (Frances nods yes.) That's a helluva lot of screwing. Good work, Frances. Anything else?

He nods to dismiss the group.

Willy deliberately leaves with Frances to show group connections, making sure McNabney sees them.

McNabney

Good move, Willy, very good.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT.

Willy and Frances get in Willy's car. She's very calm and reserved.

INT. CAR -- NIGHT.

Willy

Where would you like to go?

Frances

Let's have a drink.

Willy looks hard at the couple on the sidewalk to see whether it's Carthage and her date. It's Dicky talking fast to Rhonda. She's brushing him off.

Willy

Sounds good.

Willy sees Carthage and Flowman walk into the Reno Club. He immediately swerves over; Frances is unaware of Willy's motives.

Willy

Reno's?

Frances nods. They park the car.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT.

Carthage cajoles Flowman into going into a speakeasy for the first time. She playfully has him by the collar. He loves it. They look very right for each other, and have a definite chemistry.

Flowman

Just this once. I really don't like this.

I don't know the password.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS SPEAKEASY -- NIGHT.

Flowman sits uneasily as Carthage enjoys herself immensely. Although Flowman is very poised, Carthage makes him extremely vulnerable, and he takes risks he wouldn't normally take. Carthage drinks wine; Flowman drinks coffee. Fiercely protective, he steadily watches her new level of comfort with wine. CAB CALLOWAY and THE MISSOURIANS play great blues onstage.

The WAITER acknowledges Willy's and Frances's entrance, and with a flourish, seats them right behind Flowman and Carthage so that Frances and Carthage are facing each other.

Willy awkwardly vies for Frances' chair but gives up. Carthage burns with jealousy at Willy's companion.

Flowman eyes the clientele, including Willy and Frances.

Flowman

I can tell a mobster miles away.

They have a special flair.

Carthage

There's no such thing as a mob.

Flowman

Says who?

Carthage

My daddy.

Flowman shows great sympathy for Carthage's loss.

Carthage notes the older Frances and her great poise.

To match Frances' powerful presence, Carthage overexerts herself to act sophisticated. She sits taller. She deepens her voice and asks someone for her first-ever cigarette. Flowman is surprised. Willy will not look at her. She can't help staring at the sophisticated couple.

Flowman

Well, I'd like to make a toast to my

new assistant.

Carthage speaks loudly and chokes on her own cigarette smoke.

Carthage

I must say, Flow, I'm very happy to be your

assistant.

Carthage tries to put a ripple of fun in her laugh. It's forced. Overhearing her, Willy raises his eyebrows.

Flowman

Did you call me Flow?

Carthage sweetly smiles yes. Flowman sort of likes the nickname. Ecstatic with her sudden seductiveness, Flowman catches the waiter and nods for "two more." Flowman tries to conceal his happiness. Willy competes loudly.

Willy

Frances, some women dream of glamour all their lives, but you are glamour.

Frances

Climb down, Willy.

Willy chokes on his drink. Carthage laughs at his failed attempt to flatter Frances.

The waiter brings Flowman and Carthage's drinks.

Willy leaves the table in embarrassment and goes to the lobby. Carthage excuses herself and follows, hoping to catch him. Carthage startles him as he comes around the corner.

Willy

What do you think you're doing?

Acting like you never saw me before. Listen,

I miss you.

Willy super-warms her with charm. She feels trust for him suddenly. She desires him. She's impressed by his charisma.

Carthage

Then help me. Help Dicky, just till

he gets on his feet.

Willy

Ok. Ok, it's no problem.

Carthage

And don't tell him I asked you.

Willy

You gonna run off with that

joker?

Carthage

Maybe.

Willy kisses her lightly on the cheek.

Back at the table, all is calm. Frances and Carthage exchange admiring looks. They both understand each other's pain and have an instant recognition of themselves in the other.

Flowman

Watch the train tonight?

Carthage shakes her head no. She suddenly turns cold to Flowman.

Carthage smiles at Frances in a genuine way. Willy turns around to see what's going on between the two women; he doesn't understand. He's caught off guard by the women's sincerity and warmth toward each other. Flowman thinks Carthage is smiling at him. There is general confusion. Flowman leaves money for the tab, and he and Carthage rise. The waiter takes it from their table. Flowman and Carthage leave.

EXT. MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

Flowman and Carthage kiss goodnight in his car.

Flowman

I want to give you that ring, Carthage.

Carthage is deep in thought.

Carthage

Flow, I can't think about that now.

It's too much!

Flowman understands.

Flowman

We'll have a private investigation. I'll take care of everything. Call me "Flow" once more.

Carthage

Goodnight, Flow.

Carthage passionately kisses him. She likes him very much, but due to his own projection of her angelic visage, he's somehow unable to see her.

Flowman drives away totally in love.

INT. THE MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

High as a kite, Mrs. Mann dances alone in the dark living room. In the background there is one small lamp on and static music on the radio. Mrs. Mann wears full curlers; her face is covered with night cream. Carthage walks toward her gently. Her mother grabs her and they begin to dance as they did when Carthage was a little girl.

Mrs. Mann

You loaned him the money.

Carthage

Of course I did.

Mrs. Mann

Thank you dear, you're such a good

girl.

Carthage

I'm a woman--Mother.

I have all kinds of plans in my head.

Mrs. Mann

How was Flow?

Carthage

I'm his assistant now. All

the girls are gonna talk.

Mrs. Mann

Oh honey, he'd do anything for you.

Carthage

He pushes me too hard, like Dicky.

Mrs. Mann

I'd marry him in a heart beat, that is...

They look at each other with surprise; Carthage is repulsed at how quickly her mother has forgotten her dad. Carthage then laughs.

Carthage

Mama!!! Go to bed!

Mrs. Mann slowly gathers up herself and walks upstairs. She looks lovingly at Carthage. Carthage casually opens Dicky's account record on the table. She is shocked to find it full of sketches of Rhonda and no records.

Carthage fingers the new bank key in her hand, unaware.

INT. BANK -- DAY.

Carthage watches Mrs. Mann enter the bank. Mrs. Mann is dressed to the hilt and in a perky mood. Carthage goes out to greet her mother who busily talks to Flowman. Mrs. Mann is always half-ready to seduce.

Flowman

...very responsible young lady.

Mrs. Mann

This job means a great

deal to her. She reminds me of my

husband more than Dicky.

Carthage appears. They all smile.

Carthage

Thanks for letting me go early.

Flowman

Anything for you, Carthage.

Good day, Mrs. Mann.

They smile and leave. The tellers huddle and whisper viciously about Carthage's special treatment.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Carthage and Mrs. Mann watch Dicky in the store. A delivery truck has pulled up; MEN unload boxes; Dicky directs them to set the boxes to the side. More CUSTOMERS roam inside, and Dicky is obviously pleased.

INT. PERFUME SHOP -- DAY.

Willy's business booms. He waves the WOMEN inside the front door; SEVERAL MEN go to the back door. Mrs. Mann overshadows her daughter's presence. Carthage doesn't mind.

Mrs. Mann

Mr. Trezona, I've heard the best things

about your store!

Willy

Why thank you, Mrs. Mann. You're looking

very pretty today. May I give you the

test?

Willy gets behind his counter and brings out his testing tray.

Mrs. Mann

Call me Pearl.

Willy slowly studies Mrs. Mann and gives her approving looks and sounds. Mrs. Mann feels very lively with the attention.

Willy

There is something beneath the perfect

tailoring that waits to leap forth.

Mrs. Mann squeezes her eyebrows together in order to understand. Carthage shakes her head yes.

Mrs. Mann

Why don't you come over for dinner

sometime, Willy? Be with the family.

Get to know us.

Willy

I'm honored. Now I have a theory,

Mrs. Mann. (She interjects "Pearl.")

Getting back to perfume, that a man

doesn't really know what goes on inside

a woman. And a woman must wear the

perfume that will help him get inside her head.

Carthage becomes fascinated and full of longing.

Mrs. Mann

If you had to tell a man your feelings,

you wouldn't know where to begin. He

wouldn't believe the desire...Well doctor,

what do you prescribe?

Pearl becomes embarrassed for talking so freely. She hurries Willy with a gleam in her eye. The customers slowly leave.

Willy

Passion Flame. It will work its way into

your voice, your walk. You'll feel a change.

Mrs. Mann

Oh my goodness.

Carthage laughs and hugs her mother.

Mrs. Mann

How much do I owe you?

Willy

It's on the house.

Mrs. Mann

Oh no. I insist. My husband always

said, "Business is business."

Willy

Please, Pearl. It's the least I could do.

For the first time, Carthage senses a connection between her father and Willy because of the familiar phrase, "Business is business." She gives him a strange look.

Mrs. Mann walks out feeling powerful, slowed, and dreamy.

Later, the store empties out. Willy locks the door and puts the CLOSED sign up, locking him and Carthage inside. Despite the danger, Carthage, has also been affected by his sales pitch. She desires him and he knows it, but he's still waiting for her to make the move.

Willy scurries around the store doing last minute jobs. He smokes sensually.

Carthage

You tell them all the same thing.

Willy

And they believe it.

Carthage

Isn't that dishonest?

Willy

Don't you know the difference between

a lie and a universal truth?

Carthage

But each woman goes away thinking

you meant it just for her.

Willy

Every woman leaves here feeling better.

And I have the bank book to show for it.

INT. WILLY'S ROOM -- DAY.

Carthage mindlessly plays with a combination lock. Her sole purpose in being here is to get information out of Willy.

The cats run to Willy for food. He ignores them for as long as he can then yells, "God damn it." As Willy feeds the cats and checks his ants, Carthage is suddenly inspired to undress, placing the bank key around her neck. Willy understands in a flash. His plan for seducing her has worked. He touches the key.

Willy

What's this?

Carthage

The key to my heart.

Willy quickly strips off his shirt.

Carthage places the key around his neck which turns him on very much. Reclining on the bed, Willy accidentally spills wine all over himself. Carthage gets on all fours to lick the wine off his belly. Willy is ecstatic.

As they make love, Willy stifles his sobs; Carthage comforts him. She doesn't understand, but she likes his emotion.

He pulls himself together.

Willy

You're such a flower.

Carthage chuckles. She's determined to get information out of him. She kisses him again.

Carthage

I guess I love you, Willy.

He lights a cigarette and tries to guess what she's up to.

Willy

Try it with a little more oomph.

Carthage

I love you.

Willy

No favors.

Carthage

I love you???

He holds her head in his hand and shakes her.

Willy

Christ, Carthage. Don't you know how to

tell a lie?

Carthage, yelling

I love you!

Willy

Better.

Willy puts on his pants and goes to his kitchenette and begins to make a meatloaf, squashing eggs, hamburger, and oats together with his fingers. Carthage comes over to his side and peels potatoes. They stand together scantily dressed. Willy still wears the key around his neck. It sparkles on his well-defined chest. The cats rub on his legs. Willy looks at Carthage and turns away just as she looks at him. Willy tosses the food in the oven. Carthage sits at the table. Willy comes over and kisses her neck.

Carthage

Tell me about my father.

Willy

I didn't know Richard.

Carthage

You know him. You said it

like he's dead. You said,"I didn't

know Richard." Past tense.

Willy

Listen, I ain't taking this. Everybody

knows him. His name is Richard.

Carthage

I caught you, Willy.

Willy

You didn't catch nothing.

Carthage hurriedly dresses.

Carthage

How would you kill me, if you had to.

Willy

Strangulation.

Carthage shudders at the quick response. She finally understands who Willy really is. She dresses quickly. Willy then tries to make a joke out of it.

Willy

How would you kill me, if you had to?

Can't you take a joke?

Carthage

Where's my purse?

Willy shrugs and smiles until she lifts the chain from his neck and puts it back on hers.

Carthage

I'd let someone else do it.

EXT. STREET -- SUNSET.

As Carthage walks, she feels someone is watching her. She stops and looks around. She can't see anyone; nevertheless, her breath quickens and she panics, breaking into a run. She takes the shortcut through the heavy-laden clotheslines again. As she arrives at the small cathedral, she calms down.

INT. CATHEDRAL -- NIGHT.

Carthage bows her head at the confessional booth and walks away.

Next, she gazes into the candles, wild with fear. TWO OLDER PEOPLE leave the pews and shuffle out. There is a deadly silence.

A WELL-APPOINTED WOMAN walks in, her high heels tapping briskly. Carthage prays that it is Frances. Much to her disappointment, it is a stranger.

INT. MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

Carthage, a bit disheveled, walks in as her family sits having supper. She hugs her huge dogs. Dicky sits in his father's place. Everyone is in good spirits.

Dicky keeps his accounting book at his side.

Dicky

Peterson said the store looks so good that he's going to do a story on us. He thinks it may bring somebody forward.

Carthage

How's the bookkeeping?

Dicky

Fine, fine. You know, the men on

our corner have been real pals.

Flow and Willy, nice guys.

Mrs. Mann

I tell you, we had a ball this afternoon in

Willy's, didn't we, Carthage? What a perfect

gentleman! I could swear I'd seen him before.

Carthage shakes her head "yes" and eats.

Dicky

I don't know why I didn't like him at first.

Mrs. Mann

Life goes on, doesn't it, Carthage?

Dicky

And Flow's getting a private eye.

Carthage, to her mother

I left my purse at work. Come with me?

Mrs. Mann

I don't think so, honey. Yes,

yes, things are going swell.

EXT. MANN'S YARD -- SUNSET.

Outside Carthage leashes the dogs and takes them with her.

EXT. STREET -- SUNSET.

Carthage, and the stately dogs walk together down the quiet street.

EXT. BANK -- SUNSET.

They get to the back door of the bank, where she leashes the dogs. Carthage is almost amazed that the key works. She's nervous and quiet.

INT. BANK -- SUNSET.

She locks the door behind her. Carthage stands in awe of the possibilities of being alone in the dark bank. In the distance she can see the well-lit vault. Carthage ceremoniously walks toward it as if walking toward freedom. She suddenly spooks. She continues walking toward the vault. Carthage lets out an uneasy laugh. She looks very guilty.

Just as she recovers, a police car sirens by. Willy's bright green roadster skims over Main Street suspiciously. Carthage lets out a moan and hits the floor. She waits paralyzed. Finally, she begins breathing again.

She goes into her office and grabs the purse from her desk. She hurries out.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT.

Outside, she breathes freely, taking the dogs' leash in her hand. In the distance, she notices the lights are on in their store. As she gets closer she can see that one of the large front windows is broken, and the police cars have stopped there.

EXT. MANN'S PHARMACY -- NIGHT.

A POLICEMAN has climbed through the broken window to show Carthage a note which says, "Business is business."

A police car drives up with Dicky and Pearl. They hurry over to inspect the damages. The officer hands Dicky and Mrs. Mann the note.

Mrs. Mann

Oh my god.

OFFICER

Not much damage, but it's pretty scary.

Dicky

The police were in on this, too.

Officer

Now, son, we've had some trouble with petty

graft in our ranks, but we still

protect the people.

Dicky, inspecting the broken window

No way I'm gonna get glass until

morning. Carthage, call the newspaper.

I wanna reporter down here.

Carthage

I wouldn't do that.

Dicky

You aren't running this store.

Mrs. Mann

Do as your brother says.

Dicky, to Pearl

I'm gonna stay here tonight. Call

Wilson for a new window, first thing

in the morning.

Mrs. Mann

It's dangerous here.

Officer

We'll watch him, ma'am.

Another policeman take Mrs. Mann home. Carthage reluctantly goes in the store to use the phone.

Officer

This is the second threat you've had.

Dicky

Yessir.

Officer

You sure you want to bring the newspaper

in on this?

Dicky

I believe in staying straight, and I

want this town to know it.

Carthage comes out of the store dragging her feet.

Dicky

Did you call?

Carthage

Want me to stay?

Dicky

You can't do anything.

Carthage stands by watching her brother create his own demise. A reporter and the photographer from the earlier scene drive up, hungry for scandal.

Photographer, snapping pictures My god! Look at this destruction!!!

Dicky

Shut yer trap.

Photographer snaps his picture again.

REPORTER, taking notes

Are you threatening my photographer?

Photographer

I'm not your photographer.

Dicky

This was a mistake.

Reporter

Wait a second. What happened tonight?

Dicky

Front window smashed by none other

than Boss McNabney and his bootleggin' mob.

Photographer gasps and starts flashing away.

Reporter

Editor's not crazy enough to print that.

Dicky

He chooses judges, mayors, senators.

He decides whether I don't sleep for a year.

He killed my father and everybody knows it.

The reporter writes as fast as he can while the photographer looks inside the store for a picture.

Carthage

Dicky, stop.

Officer

You're making some very serious charges, son.

You better just take it all back.

Dicky thinks hard for a minute, looking as if he's going to explode from rage.

Dicky

This whole town's afraid.

Officer

You're right about that.

Reporter

Is it true that your sister dates

William Trezona?

Dicky is heartbroken over this dangerous question.

Dicky

No.

Reporter

My photographer has seen them together...

Photographer

Benny, I am not your photographer, dammit!

Dicky

Get the hell off my property!

If you print anything about me or my

family I'll kill you!!

Dicky takes a swing at the reporter. The photographer snaps away. The reporter drops his pad of paper. Dicky shreds it. The police cool things down. Dicky goes for the camera and misses.

The newspaper men drive off in a hurry. The cops shake

their heads. Dicky is so angry he puts his fist through the remaining good window. He cries out and goes inside to weep.

INT. PHARMACY -- NIGHT.

His crying lasts for only seconds; he clears his head, finds a broom, and begins sweeping. The police stand around exasperated.

INT. PHARMACY -- DAWN.

Carthage tenderly waits for her brother to awake. Dicky wakes startled on the floor in a pile of blankets. He looks at his sister and pats her arm in a genuine but rare moment of affection. Carthage loves her big brother. He holds a gun in his hand and watches his frosty breath. He quickly becomes alert and looks around the store.

Outside the store the police from the night before circle and wave to Dicky as he rises. The cops nod. The WINDOW SUPPLIER pulls up outside and honks. Dicky motions them on.

Dicky

Seen the paper?

The driver shakes his head no. There is great tension. The two window suppliers untie the glass from the sides of the truck.

Inside, Dicky ducks in front of a mirror to groom himself. He studies his face as if measuring his own nerve. The men are busy installing the new windows.

Willy watches from his shadowy storefront window as Dicky and Carthage cross the street for coffee. Dicky lightly holds her arm and treats her with respect, as he used to do. She loves it. They check the newspaper stand which is empty.

INT. CAFE -- MORNING.

Mabel in pink frills, raises her coffee pot to Dicky and Carthage. She quickly brings them a cup; Dicky throws down a nickel, and says, "Thanks Mabel." He guzzles the coffee and walks back to the pharmacy. Carthage stays waiting for the paper.

INT. PHARMACY -- MORNING.

Dicky folds his blankets and puts the gun in a safe. One window has been replaced. Dicky goes in back to a large mortar and pestle, every now and then checking his watch. He's very tense.

The window suppliers finish putting in the second window when Chowder and Fritz cruise past the front of the store. The window supplier writes up a bill and takes it in to Dicky.

Dicky

Thanks for coming by so early, Tom.

Tom

Anything for a pal.

The window suppliers drive off. The street is very quiet. A cop from the night before comes through the back. Dicky is startled.

Officer

Dicky, we're letting up now that you got

your windows in. Call us if you need us.

Dicky

Thanks.

The cops drive off. Chowder drives past again. From the window, Dicky sees Willy walking to his perfumery. Dicky calls home.

Dicky

Everything okay there?

VOICE OVER -- Mrs. Mann

Yes dear. Everything okay there?

Dicky, pausing

Yes ma'am.

VOICE OVER -- Mrs. Mann

Dicky, what's wrong?

The back door of the pharmacy opens.

Dicky

I gotta go.

Dicky hangs up the phone.

INT. CAFE -- MORNING.

In the coffee shop, Carthage reads the paper in horror. The front page features a large photo or her, Dicky, and the dogs with bold headline,"Mann Kid Accuses Boss."

INT. PERFUMERY -- MORNING.

Willy puts down the morning paper and cringes as he drinks his coffee. He keeps checking his watch. Next, he busily works on stocking his shelves. He pauses to look out his back window.

EXT. ALLEY -- MORNING.

In the alley, Chowder and Fritz park. Fritz places a baseball bat under his trenchcoat before going into Dicky's store.

INT. PERFUMERY -- MORNING.

Willy panics. He struggles for a second, almost deciding to intervene for Dicky. He puts his hand on the doorknob then removes it. He rests against a wall as he imagines what happens next door. Tears form in his eyes.

Willy peeks out the window, waiting for the gang members to leave the pharmacy. As soon as they're gone, he runs next door, pretending he doesn't know what's just happened. He whistles as he enters the back door.

INT. PHARMACY -- MORNING.

Willy gingerly walks through the pharmacy.

Willy

Hey early bird, rise and shine.

Hey Dicky? Came in a little early.

Saw your light on. Dicky?

Dicky moans downstairs. Willy, becoming afraid, follows the sound and finds Dicky on the floor.

Willy

Oh.

Willy sees that Dicky is crying and begins to laugh hysterically. Willy's problem goes beyond mere mental health, he's a battlefield for good and evil.

INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY.

Tears stream from Willy's eyes as he stands over Dicky's bed with Carthage and Mrs. Mann. While Carthage and her mom are extremely upset, they are terribly distracted by Willy's crying. They have never really seen a man openly cry. Carthage is taken in.

The DOCTOR leads Mrs. Mann into the hallway, leaving Willy and Carthage alone with her unconscious brother.

Carthage

You're very brave, Willy.

I misjudged you. You saved Dicky's life.

Willy

I found him. That's all.

INT. BANK -- DAY.

Carthage checks her watch and enters the bank. Flowman's in his office. The tellers ridicule her with whispers. Flow looks at her sternly.

Carthage

None of it's true.

Flowman

What about Trezona?

Carthage

None of it's true.

Flowman

Are you dating him?

Carthage

No.

Flowman

I'm telling you, Carthage, Trezona is a rotten egg. Who else just magically appears in town with $10,000. What the hell is going on?

Carthage

I know him a little. I think

he knows Dad.

Flowman

Carthage, it's not your place

to investigate. It's too dangerous.

I'm taking care of it. Does he have

feelings for you?

Carthage

No.

Flowman

I'll get the Star to retract those statements about you.

Carthage looks at him, realizing the danger she is in. She goes to her desk.

At the end of the day, Carthage quits at her adding machine. Feeling very uneasy, she watches Flowman's combination to the safe and memorizes it. Flowman locks the money in the vault. The tellers have gone.

Flowman

We're getting those timed

locks, now that crime's going up. Damn it,

Carthage, are you telling me

everything? I must know.

Flowman is overwhelmed with inappropriate lust. He mashes her with a huge, slobbery kiss. He becomes turned on.

Carthage becomes enraged and growls at him like an animal. She has been repressing this for a long time.

Carthage

Get away from me!! You

smother me!!!

Flowman is chilled by her rage.

Flowman

Of course, darling.

EXT. BANK -- SUNSET.

Carthage runs out of the bank. She is furious and wild-eyed.

EXT. STREET -- SUNSET.

Getting up her nerve, Carthage goes to the Reno Club by herself.

INT. RENO CLUB-- NIGHT.

Inside the posh jazz night club, Carthage sits at the bar. SEVERAL MEN jeer at her. They whistle and laugh to intimidate her. She picks up her glass of wine and goes to another darker lounge area that is sparsely populated.

As Carthage settles down, her eyes get used to the dark. She realizes that TWO WOMEN are passionately kissing at the nearby table. Carthage has never seen anything like this before. She's stunned and intrigued.

It's Frances and a GLAMOROUS FRIEND. Frances lets out a surprised gasp when she recognizes Carthage. Their disparate worlds have finally collided. Carthage leaves immediately, feeling betrayed, alone, and embarrassed. She runs out.

INT. CATHEDRAL -- SUNSET.

Carthage looks into the votives as if in a trance. Her cheeks are stained with tears. Her world has collapsed. She can't trust anyone. Suddenly Frances is there.

Frances approaches her. They have a deep recognition of the other; they silently communicate like sisters. Carthage is shy in her presence.

Carthage

I like it here.

Frances

Yes.

Carthage

I like the way you dress.

Frances

I dress like you.

They laugh a little.

Carthage

Clothes, that's all my mother and I have left. When those wear out, so do our dreams.

Frances

May I sit?

Carthage nods yes. Both women feel estranged in this violent world made by men, but both have the spirit to fight it.

Carthage

When I saw you on the street with McNabney's men I said, "She's too good for them."

Carthage pauses for Frances to say her name.

Frances

Frances.

Carthage

Frances. Why do you do it?

Frances

It's better than being

a victim. What's your fascination?

Carthage searches for an answer.

Carthage

I woke up one morning, Frances, in a world without my father. And everyone I'd ever known was a stranger, even my brother. And now, they're all trying to steal something from me, something I'd gladly give, if I only knew what they wanted.

Frances

Everyone in this town is ugly, except you. You're a fresh little rose in a filthy, old dust bowl. That's what they're after.

Carthage

What about Willy and them?

Frances

Believe your suspicions. That's all I can say. I'm no better than the rest. When I sit here in the dark, I'm not praying, I'm figuring out how to saveFrances.

Carthage

Frances, what should I do?

Frances

Look, I work with them. Believe the worst. Then take action. That's all I can say.

In her innocence, Carthage cuts Frances at her core.

Carthage

Do you like the career you've chosen?

Frances has never asked herself this question. She's stunned. She's never thought of her life in terms of her own choices.

Frances

No.

Desperate for trusting closeness, Carthage grabs Frances.

Carthage

Frances, are you my friend?

Frances looks very startled and upset, for she also desires to possess Carthage's untainted quality. Carthage begins to cry as she hugs Frances. Terribly lonely, Frances quickly walks away, muttering "Yes."

Carthage sits by herself in the dark corner, working out her own salvation. In this moment, her innocence vanishes.

EXT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

Carthage walks home from the church. As she gets home, Willy drives up beside her.

Willy

Jump in.

Carthage

No thanks.

Willy

C'mon, Carthage. I wanna talk.

Carthage

No.

Willy

What's wrong?

Carthage

You're bad.

Willy

This morning I saved your brother!

They walk up the steps. Carthage lets the dogs off the chains. The dogs don't like Willy. Willy watches their every move.

Willy

Got any proof?

Carthage, unlocking the door

I talked to Frances. Get lost.

Carthage has raised her power by dropping Frances' name. Willy pushes her inside the house away from the dogs. He doesn't know Carthage is bluffing. Now he feels he must tell something of the truth.

INT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

Willy closes the door behind them and pins Carthage to the door in the dark room. His actions are somewhere between dangerous and playful. Carthage shows that strange sensation of knowing and not knowing someone at the same time. She breathes rapidly.

Willy

Alright. You're a big girl. I knew your father. Met him about a year ago. Both worked for McNabney.

Carthage

Past tense. He's dead, isn't he?

Willy

I feel like your husband. I feel like your father. I moved down from Chicago to get away from the big guys. I told the Boss no rough stuff.

Carthage

He's dead isn't he? I knew it in my heart.

Carthage seems relaxed suddenly. She slowly wanders upstairs to her bedroom.

Willy

Ever hear of Johnny Torrio? Valentine's Day massacre?

Carthage

Yes.

Willy sheds a tear at the memory.

Willy

Why do you think I decorated my shop with

hearts? I was there in the restaurant drinking a cup of coffee while all my friends bled to death. I just get caught up.

Carthage, paces for a moment, looking at her Ansel Adams print.

Carthage

Did he go on the river with McNabney?

Willy

I don't know, probably.

Carthage

He used to drive us out there.

Carthage walks downstairs. Willy follows.

Willy

Look, I'm not telling you nothing. That Flowman really likes you doesn't he? I'm no dummy, Carthage. Somebody's following me. It's not going to do anybody any good.

Carthage

Especially you.

Willy angrily grabs her.

Willy

You tell him that I've got my undercover man dogging his undercover man!

Carthage

It wasn't my idea. Flowman's paying the tab.

Willy

You call him off. Or, or I'll kill him.

Carthage gasps. She's shocked. She slaps him.

Willy rips the shoulder of her dress.

Willy

Face it. You're in love with me.

Carthage

Scumbag.

Willy winds up to strike her down, then he settles for a light slap on her cheek.

He pulls the bank key chain from around her neck and puts it on. Carthage, angered by the slap, grabs the chain from his neck and breaks it off. The key sails through the air and lands on the floor in a dark corner.

Willy paces to cool down. Carthage opens the door and whistles to the dogs. They bound inside ready to kill at her command.

Carthage

You know everything.

She goes to the phone. He grabs the phone from her.

Willy

Carthage, I haven't told you anything.

I knew your father. That's no crime. I'm a crook but so was your old man. You 're not going to tell that to the whole world, are you?

Carthage is deeply offended. She speaks with fierce conviction.

Carthage

My father was an angel.

Willy

I'm quitting. They won't like it, but

I'll quit for you.

With her dogs, Carthage pushes Willy to the door, muttering, "Get out." Willy backs down the stairs. He walks away and lights a cigarette.

Willy

Bitch.

Willy drives away. Carthage turns the house lights on. The song, "Gloomy Sunday" plays on the radio. She sits in a recliner and picks at a rose in the vase beside the chair.

She goes upstairs to her parents' bedroom and studies her father's portrait. She briefly looks at photos of the whole family.

Carthage searches through the closet until she finds a hunting rifle. As she moves the lever down she can see a brass bullet slip into the chamber. All she must do is pull the trigger. She holds the gun as if to shoot.

Carthage realizes that she's aiming at a portrait of Dicky. She shudders and points the gun out the window where a small bird sits on a feeder. This also surprises her. She pretends to pull the trigger and softly says, "Kabam," but the bird flies away. She takes the gun to her bedroom.

The phone rings as she is running her bath water. Her voice can barely be heard.

Carthage

Yes, Mama. You're staying there? How's Dicky? No, I'm not scared. Sure, send 'em over. A few more thousand police couldn't hurt. No, they've been circling. No, I'm not mad. I'm staying here. I'm staying here!

She soaks in the bubble bath, looking very peaceful.

Later, before she turns off the lights, she checks out the front window. A police car sits in front of the house. Carthage waves at the TWO POLICEMEN. They wave back. The house lights go off. All is dark.

EXT. MANN HOME -- EARLY NEXT MORNING.

Carthage sticks her head out the door. One of the police is asleep. The driver waves at Carthage and drives away.

INT. MANN HOME -- EARLY NEXT MORNING.

Carthage wraps the rifle in a sheet.

EXT. MANN YARD -- EARLY MORNING.

She carries the covered gun out to the car. She calls for Keeper and Companion to get in.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Carthage pulls up to the intersection downtown where she can see that the drug store says CLOSED.

She looks at the bank and decides that since she's playing hooky, she will turn in the other direction and avoid driving past it.

EXT. COUNTRY -- DAY.

Carthage drives into the rolling countryside.

EXT. RIVER BANK -- DAY.

Out in the country, Carthage parks in a closed glade next to the majestic Missouri River. There are several barges which pass within her rifle range.

She gets a pair of binoculars out of the glove compartment and scans the river. She gets a pad of paper and a pencil from the back seat floor and draws a childish target on it. She sets it against a tree.

Her dogs scatter and track. Carthage walks back to get a good distance from the tree and shoots. She hits the paper but misses the target. She's terrified. Her dogs go crazy with excitement. She cranks the magazine loader again and walks back further. Keeper stubbornly grovels twenty feet in front of the rifle barrel and stares right into it. She yells at him.

Carthage

Move! Keeper, move!

She eyes the river again. She checks to make sure her car is concealed by trees. She puts a pile of leaves on her hood and roof for camouflage. She checks her watch. It's 10:00 a.m. She finds a sunny spot and enjoys it.

At 2:00 p.m. she checks her watch again. She views the river through binoculars. It is a busy water way. She decides to try the target once again. Keeper goes berserk again. Carthage throws a horrible temper tantrum.

Carthage

Goddamn you, Keeper. I told you to

get the hell out of my way and I meant it. Now move! Move!

Keeper howls an apology.

Extremely paranoid, Carthage looks around herself again and again. She sweats profusely. She can see in the distance several ferries, but none is McNabney's. Holding the dogs close, she has a long, soothing talk with them.

She goes to the car to warm up and listen to the radio. She puts on heavy eye makeup in the rear view mirror.

At 4:30 p.m. Carthage spots the silhouette of the McNabney's horses on his boat. She's thrilled and empowered.

The barge gets closer. Carthage raises the gun to shoot. She shoots and accidentally hits her dog, Keeper, as it runs into the firing line.

Carthage runs to it and falls to the ground crying its name, "Keeper." The other hound comes over to Carthage.

Then she remembers that the Boss is on his way. She's angrier than ever. She runs to a bank and lies on her belly in the leaves. The ferry nears.

On the deck of the ferry, the four matched horses look elegant in their silhouette. McNabney briskly strolls the open deck smoking a cigar. He stretches his arms out like an robust emperor.

Carthage looks behind her to make sure her car is concealed.

The ferry rolls almost out of range. Carthage steadies her gun and fires.

She hits one horse; the rest are spooked and jump overboard, drowning together in a harness.

McNabney yells to the captain to stop. "Someone's trying to kill me!" he yells, running inside the cabin. The ferry quickly crosses.

Carthage watches the magnificent horses drown.

She runs back to her dead dog and drags him to the car, wrapping him in a sheet. She struggles to put the dog's large body in the trunk of her car, then returns to cover its blood with leaves.

She jumps in the car with Companion and drives off. She quickly reverses when she realizes that she has forgotten her rifle. She throws it in the back seat and drives away. All the leaves on her car blow away.

All around her the countryside is very peaceful. She sweats profusely and draws long uneven breaths.

She comes to the top of a hill where she can see the Boss on his boat through her binoculars. She stops and watches him peeking out of the cabin with a gun. She begins to feel very satisfied until she drives away and looks down at her skirt -- there is blood all over her lap. She screams.

EXT. MANN HOME -- AFTERNOON.

As she pulls up to her house, she watches it very closely. No one is in sight. She rushes inside with the rifle in a sheet and puts the whining Companion in the fenced yard. She comes back out with a large box and opens the trunk. With all her might, she clumsily drags Keeper's wrapped body in the box and lugs it upstairs to her bedroom closet. Her arms shake and her face is bright red.

She goes back to check the car for blood. There isn't any. She draws a bath.

SIRENS sound around town. She gets a glass of milk and collapses in a kitchen chair. She begins to breathe normally.

The DOORBELL RINGS. She thinks she's having a heart attack. She pulls together until she sees that it's two policeman she has seen before. She dreads answering the door.

Carthage

Hello officers.

1st Officer

Good to see you back. We've been here

several times today.

2nd Officer

Just a few questions.

Carthage

I didn't do anything.

1st Officer

We know. But we wanted to see if you

could give us any more information

pertaining to your brother's assault?

Carthage

No, I really can't. I told you

everything yesterday.

1st Officer

Any names?

Carthage

Sorry. I'm at a loss. Got the flu.

2nd Officer

Had to check. Get well now.

Carthage

Thank you.

2nd Officer

And don't worry. We know that newspaper story wasn't true.

Carthage notices some dried blood on her right arm.

Carthage

Good.

An officer extends his hand to Carthage. She has to use the bloodied arm to shake his. She gives it to him. He doesn't seem to notice. Carthage sweats. They leave.

Carthage

Thanks again.

Carthage slams the door and goes to the running bath. Before she finishes bathing, Mrs. Mann comes home.

Mrs. Mann

Yoo-hoo! Watcha got for dinner?

Carthage

Uh-oh.

Mrs. Mann

Dicky's coming home, and I invited

William, too.

Carthage

Willy? Mother, I don't want him over here...

Mrs. Mann

Oh Carthage, look, your face is red.

Carthage

I'm sick.

Mrs. Mann

Flowman said you called in.

Carthage

Yeah. Why'd you invite Willy?

Mrs. Mann

He's been so helpful. Reminds me of Dad.

Carthage rolls her eyes and massages her temples.

Carthage

I'll get him to help me carry

something downstairs.

Mrs. Mann

Finish your bath. I'll get supper.

Carthage wraps in a towel and rushes upstairs. She puts on a short-sleeved dress. She checks the box containing her dog. Unknowingly, she brushes more blood on her arm.

Next, Carthage forges Dicky a get well card from Rhonda as the AMBULANCE DRIVER and his HELPER set Dicky up in the living room. Willy also arrives, newspaper under his arm.

Carthage comes downstairs with a dirty look.

Willy

Your mother insisted.

Carthage

I've got some dirty work for you; that's

the only reason I'm letting you in.

Willy

I adore you.

Carthage

Hi, Dicky.

She kisses her brother's forehead and hands him the forged card.

Dicky

I should have listened to you, sis.

Carthage

Look, it's from Rhonda.

Dicky, ripping it open

Rhonda!

Willy smiles. Mrs. Mann nods to the brandy glasses and cordial flask.

Mrs. Mann

Carthage, would you please get our guest a cordial? And Dicky, too, if he wants one; do ya, Dicky?

Dicky is in ecstasy over the card.

Dicky

Sure, Mom.

Mrs. Mann returns to the kitchen. Carthage looks out the window at Companion as she pours the drinks. Willy, hands the paper to Dicky. Carthage is thoroughly preoccupied with her schemes.

Willy

Looks like someone's on your side, Dicky.

Attempt on McNabney's life. Top story.

Dicky reads quickly muttering, "My god."

Willy

Nothing like blackberry cordial.

Carthage

My father made it. Past tense. Richard Mann's very own Missouri blackberry cordial.

Willy winces at her chiding. Dicky hands the paper to Carthage. There's a large photo of McNabney on deck next to a pool of blood. Carthage shudders.

Dicky

Come here, Carthage. You have something on

the back of your arm.

He spits on his finger and scrubs it off. Carthage is mortified.

Willy

Musta been a one man job. Mind if I smoke?

Carthage laughs suddenly and strangely. She's beside herself with a discharge of hysterical, nervous laughter.

Dicky

What in the hell? Give me the phone.

Carthage

It's too soon to call her. You're not

supposed to thank people for get well

cards anyway.

The doorbell rings. A FLOWER BOY delivers a box of yellow roses from Frances.

FLOWER BOY

Flowers for Carthage Mann.

Carthage, smiling at Willy

Yes? Thank you.

The flower boy leaves. Carthage silently reads the card from Frances which is signed simply,"F." Carthage mutters "Frances" to herself and quickly stashes the card in her pocket. She feels very proud. Willy is afraid they could contain explosives from the mob. He grabs them from her and checks them quickly. Dicky gives him a strange look. Mrs. Mann comes from the kitchen with food. Carthage places the roses in a vase.

Mrs. Mann, seeing the roses

Oh my goodness. For me?

Everybody laughs.

Dicky

Mom, may I please have the phone?

Carthage

"Get well" from Flowman.

Thinking the flowers are from Flowman, Willy has a silent tantrum. He lights a cigarette, blowing smoke on them.

The smoke entwining the lovely roses symbolizes Willy's influence on Carthage.

Willy

You didn't go to work today?

Carthage

No.

Mrs. Mann

Let's eat. Would the guest please lead us in prayer.

Carthage is amused with the hilarity of evil Willy saying a prayer. She enjoys Willy's embarrassment and gets uncontrollable giggles during the prayer. Willy has never said a prayer in his life.

Willy

Yeah. Sure. Uh. God, you are

most definitely big and great.

And, ah, we thank you for everything, cars, clothes. So goodbye. So long. Catch ya tomorrow.

Willy instantly hates Carthage for laughing at him.

Dicky and Mrs. Mann stonily stare at Carthage who has tears streaming down her face. She tries to pull herself together.

Dicky

Jesus Christ. Mother, hand me that phone.

Mrs. Mann brings Dicky the phone. Carthage sits at the head of the table and plays with her food. She blanches as Dicky dials Rhonda.

Dicky

May I speak to Rhonda, please?

Rhonda, Dicky Mann. Got your card.

It was swell... What?

Rhonda hangs up on him. Dicky turns toward his sister as rage fills his face.

Dicky

It was you...

Dicky chokes on his food.

The DOORBELL RINGS. A STRANGE FLOWER BOY delivers another box of roses, charged with explosives. As he hands them to Carthage, he quickly breaks the seal to the bomb's fuse.

STRANGE FLOWER BOY

Flowers for the Mann family.

Carthage takes them, muttering "Thank you." The strange flower boy quickly leaves. Recognizing an old mob trick, Willy grabs the box from her.

He frantically hurls them out the front door just in time for the bomb to go off.

EXT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

The strange flower boy runs like hell and jumps into a suspicious-looking car as he tears off his uniform.

INT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

The family is simply in a state of shock. They're silent for a few moments, and then things pick up where they left off.

Until now, Carthage has treated Willy with total disdain. She suddenly needs him.

Carthage

Willy, I have a box of old

clothes up in my room. Carry it down for me?

Mrs. Mann

Don't throw away anything I could wear.

Dicky, are you comfortable?

Dicky

Yes ma'am.

Mrs. Mann clears the table and scrapes the scraps onto two plates.

Willy and Carthage walk upstairs. Dicky is still in shock. Mrs. Mann gets ice cream for him. Dicky dials the police to report the bomb.

Dicky

Sheriff Swanson, please.

Dicky Mann. You need to come over...

Carthage and Willy come down stairs. Willy struggles all the way with the box. Carthage hurries to open the front door. Mrs. Mann eats ice cream.

Mrs. Mann

I'm sure grandma could quilt some of those things. Why don't you let me go through them first?

EXT. MANN YARD -- SUNSET.

Willy trots out the door with the heavy box. The police walk up muttering congratulations to Willy for saving Dicky's life. Willy nods to the exploded vase on the lawn. He throws the box in his trunk. Carthage follows Willy, looking for blood all the way. She's in a state of disbelief as they drive off.

Mrs. Mann comes out on the porch with the plate of scraps yelling, "Keeper! Companion!" Mrs. Mann doesn't notice that there's only one dog as she stands with the police, yapping and gesticulating wildly about the explosion.

INT. WILLY'S CAR -- SUNSET.

In the car Carthage swallows hard. A tear forms in her eye.

Willy

What's in the box?

Carthage

I killed my dog today.

Willy hurries to put his arm around her.

Willy

What happened?

Carthage

It's too terrible. I can't tell you.

Willy drives silently for a moment.

Willy

Oh my god. It was you!

Willy laughs joyously as Carthage cries her heart out.

Willy

It was you, wasn't it?

Carthage looks up with a huge smile on her face.

Carthage

Does he know it was me?

Willy

He sent flowers, didn't he?

Oh, Carthage. You're the women of my dreams! I love you. I adore you. Where are we going?

Carthage

The dump. You mean, he knows it was me?

Willy

Naw, he's just guessing.

You scared the hell out of god!!!

She looks at Willy in a penetratingly calm way. Willy shivers.

EXT. DUMP -- SUNSET.

Willy stops the car at the edge of the dump. He opens the trunk and hurls the box into a deep pit.

INT. WILLY'S CAR -- SUNSET.

They drive through the country back into town. Willy holds her hand. Every now and then he shakes his head.

EXT. HOTEL CELESTE -- NIGHT.

At Willy's hotel, Bob and Stubs are pulling up.

Willy, to Carthage

Wait here.

He walks over to his friends.

Willy, to the men

What's up?

Stubs

City Hall by 9:00.

Willy

Thanks for the word.

Stubs and Bob drive off. Willy returns to his car.

Willy

Wish I didn't have to go.

Carthage

You said you quit.

EXT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

They drive up to her house; most of the lights are out. Willy kisses her goodnight. Carthage pats Companion as she goes in saying, "Where's Keeper? Where's Father?" Carthage goes in her front door. Willy drives off to City Hall.

EXT. CITY HALL -- NIGHT.

Willy and Fritz pull up at about the same time and walk in together. The rest of the men are present with several NEW FACES, including the strange flower boy. Chowder is absent. Drunk and sorrowful, McNabney heads the round table with the Mayor. McNabney, visibly shaken, drinks scotch with his cookies. He blows his nose on his shirt tail and scrutinizes his men. Frances is nervous. Laticia looks exceptionally tired. McNabney fingers his pistol.

Herman and Sherman

Dicky Mann, sir.

McNabney

Not a brilliant piece of guesswork.

Willy

He was in the hospital, sir. It couldn't

have been him.

McNabney

William, we know that. Certainly contracts

are not unique to Chicago? Did he get my flowers.

At the same time, Willy and the strange flower boy give contradictory answers.

Willy

No sir.

Strange Flower Boy

Yes sir.

McNabney

Wait a minute. Are we talking about the same flowers? You boys should have seen my horses.

Sucking on his tie, McNabney begins trembling and stares off into space.

The group feels awkward in the long silence; they avoid looking at each other. They've never seen McNabney so upset.

McNabney

I want four more bodyguards. Highly skilled. Damn you, Laticia, damn you and your hair appointments. Fritzy, I want 'em in as soon as you can. Chicago. Jersey. Until then, I'm staying inside. As soon as Chowder gets back we're going to get rid of the Star editor. And I want Dickhead Mann out of my way for good.

Willy

I'd like to say, sir, that Dicky Mann is not a threat to you. He's a kid and he's in no shape to even run his own business.

McNabney

And I suppose you know this, not from your dealings with the girl, but from your steadfast dedication to me.

Willy

A little of both, sir.

Frances grows uncomfortable. Willy is bursting to talk.

McNabney

Yes?

Willy

I'd like to liquidate, sir.

I'm in love.

Frances looks alarmed. McNabney is appalled and then it strikes him as hilarious. He wheezes with laughter.

McNabney

Nice knowing ya. Smart as a whip. Goddamn.

Willy

I want to be out and alive, sir.

McNabney

Now why, why do I have to lose Willy and

my horses on the same day?

Willy

With utmost respect ...

McNabney

You knock off Dicky Mann, and you'll never hear from me again.

Willy

I'm not a killer.

McNabney

I'm not either. C'mere, Latty.

McNabney stares at her till she stands. Laticia's eyes dilate as McNabney pulls out his gun. McNabney shoots her in the head without flinching. Laticia reels to the floor. Frances looks on in horror. When McNabney turns to look at her next, Frances shows no emotion whatsoever. Everyone is silent and still. Laticia bleeds to death. McNabney wipes the pistol with his hanky and hands the gun to Herman.

McNabney

If you don't kill Dicky Mann, some other son

of a bitch will. Herman, call the coroner. Say the dingbat whore shot herself. Love's not all it's cracked up to be.

Suddenly, Frances attacks McNabney like a wild animal. She strikes his face about twenty times. He doesn't know what hit him. All the men are shocked and intrigued.

Herman and Sherman pull her off their boss. McNabney pulls himself together, truly amazed at Frances. One look from him says that she is dead.

McNabney

Letting off a little steam.

That's all. That's okay, Frances.

McNabney starts to leave the room with everyone except Willy and Frances. Willy openly weeps over Laticia. Frances sits frozen. In this moment she decides to get out of town as fast as she can.

McNabney pauses to finish talking to Willy.

McNabney

I gotta know when and

where you're gonna kill him.

Willy wants to talk back but holds himself in check.

McNabney addresses Frances.

McNabney

Was she fucking you too?

McNabney holds Stubs' arm as they leave. Frances and Willy stare at each other.

INT. BANK -- NOON.

Flowman sits at his desk listening intensely to the person on the phone.

Flowman

I do not sell stock on margin, no sir.

I never have. This is a bank not a finance house.

Carthage looks tired and rattled as she works at the adding machine. A teller accepts a box from the Flower Boy and brings the roses to Carthage. Instead of her usual joy, she looks afraid. She checks for explosives then lobs them in the trash can. Flowman looks in angrily from his desk.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Willy watches the bank's goldtone doors from his store window. He slams his fist down on the table when he sees Flowman opening the door for Carthage. Flowman repeatedly tries to tell Carthage something very serious. She is shaking her head no, refusing to get in Flow's car. Flowman is furious.

Flowman

Don't deny it, Carthage. Hotel Celeste. He saw you together, for Christ's sake! I can't trust you anymore. I couldn't possibly marry you. I can't believe anything you say.

Carthage

But...but...

He tells her off, yelling at her on the street. Carthage walks away shattered. Willy is very happy at the disturbance.

INT. MANN HOME -- DAY.

Flowman, Dicky, and Mrs. Mann are situated in the dining room where Dicky reclines sullenly, listening to the radio. Ice packs surround his knees.

Flowman

He worked with Capone before things got too hot. As far as we can tell his perfume shop is legitimate and well run. But he does have ties withMcNabney. The worst of it is that he's in love with Carthage. My detective has seen them. I won't permit myself to discuss it.

Mrs. Mann

No, no.

Mrs. Mann frantically rubs Dicky's legs.

Flowman

I don't want to tell you this. But your husband was associated with McNabney for years. When McNabney got interested in the syndicate, your husband wanted out. Only then did he disappear. Trezona undoubtedly knows of your husband's whereabouts, but he'll never tell.

Mrs. Mann

Oh my god. Are you sure?

Flowman nods yes.

Flowman

The McNabney connection, well, they

commit crimes in broad daylight. They

keep Missouri wet. They ran the election.

Flowman rises to leave. He's very sad.

Flowman

Now that I cannot marry Carthage, you should all leave while you still have each other. Start over somewhere else. She knows she can keep her job until then. This won't affect our professional relationship. I still want what's best for her.

EXT. STREET -- DAY.

Willy sees Dicky on crutches hobble down the street and unlock the pharmacy. Willy, sensing that something's wrong, goes into the pharmacy.

INT. PHARMACY -- DAY.

Dicky situates himself near the cash register. He tears out all the sketches of Rhonda and throws them in the garbage can at his side. He sips painkiller, and for the first time, begins to take inventory, recording numbers in his book. Willy comes in. Dicky fishes in his inside coat pocket for a pistol.

Dicky

I was hoping you'd drop by Trezona.

Willy

Hi ya, Dicky.

Dicky aims a pistol at him.

Dicky

I wanna know two things. Who killed

McNabney's horses, and who's gonna kill me?

Willy

First of all, you're right, the Boss wants

you dead. You gotta cover your ass with

lead. And Dicky, your sister thought

she was doing you a favor.

Dicky

Carthage!!

Willy

She did it for you, Dicky. She can't

stand seeing you down and out. Besides,

I'm not a killer.

Dicky

She's set me up! Christ.

Guess you're the right man for the job.

Willy

You've lost one hell of a sister.

She only wanted to help you.

Dicky

He knows, doesn't he?

Willy

I ain't telling, you ain't telling,

and Carthage damned sure ain't

telling. You know, you ought

to be at home resting.

Dicky

Trezona, what an actor. Can you hear

yourself? Now get the fuck outta here. I ought to shoot you in the balls. Carthage wouldn't want you then.

Willy walks out backwards. Rhonda coyly walks in dressed to the hilt, hat and all, only to find the gun meant for Willy is pointed at her.

Rhonda

Hello, Dicky. I wanted to see how

you're doing.

Dicky

Kiss my ass.

Rhonda gasps.

INT. BANK -- AFTERNOON.

Flowman is stricken with sadness at Carthage's lies, but he manages a professional front. Together, they close out the bank for the day. Carthage studies Flowman's moves and writes down the combination and stuffs it in her purse.

EXT. STREET -- AFTERNOON.

Flowman and she walk out on the street after locking up. He gently says goodbye to her on the street. Willy watches from his store. Flowman catches Carthage by the sleeve, unwilling to let her go. He kisses her passionately as if he knows she's leaving forever. He still loves her. Carthage is stunned by the depth of his compassion and just stands there as he gets in his car and drives off. She feels the loss of his respect and starts to call his name, knowing it's the last time she'll ever see him.

INT. CAFE -- DAY.

Mabel pours Carthage a cup of coffee and hurries off to ANOTHER CUSTOMER. Carthage never takes a drink but sits at a window and stares at all the businesses. It is her final farewell to the little street and all of its huge problems. She watches an ambulance pull up at the pharmacy. She watches as Dicky, on crutches, resists the doctor's orders and then finally gets on the stretcher. She starts to run outside to help her brother but changes her mind. She watches the dark void of her family's closed store.

Next she watches Willy bribe some OLD GALS with his overblown selling.

Finally, she stares at the bank doors that swing in and out with CUSTOMERS. She zeroes in on the door's keyhole.

Mabel circles back and adds a tiny drop of coffee to Carthage's full cup. A customer signals to Mabel before she can respond. Carthage holds her French book.

Carthage

Bonjour, Madame. J'ai besoin d'un...

Carthage mumbles, "Goodbye" and walks outside.

Carthage passes Willy's window. He scurries about packing up his shelves and singing "Rhapsody in Blue." She stares at him without expression. He sees her and waves. He yells through the window.

Willy

8:00?

Carthage again nods no.

Willy blows her a kiss.

Carthage walks to the dark family store and stares in. For a second she imagines how it was when she was younger.

FLASHBACK TEN YEARS. INT. PHARMACY -- SUNNY DAY.

Carthage, as a YOUNG GIRL in pigtails, sits proudly at the spotless, solid oak soda fountain beaming at her father. She eats an enormous ice cream sundae. Her tall, intellectual father stands in his white jacket, gently smiling and talking to the pleased CUSTOMERS. The store bustles. Her father radiates warmth and trust.

BACK TO PRESENT TIME. EXT. STREET -- AFTERNOON.

Willy drives past and honks, snapping her out of the pleasant memory. Carthage hates him for ruining her daydream.

INT. MANN HOME -- SUNSET.

At home, the dog ignores Carthage; she's relieved. In the dining room, Mrs. Mann is setting supper. Dicky reclines, his knees on ice packs. He seethes with anger. Mrs. Mann is alert for once.

Mrs. Mann

Dear, Flow came by and told us some, well, things...

Carthage

I know, Mama.

She goes directly upstairs. She gets out two suitcases from under the bed and packs a few clothes. She shoves the bags back under her bed. She looks in the mirror and applies sultry eyeliner.

VOICE OVER -- Mrs. Mann

Carthage, dinner's on. We need to talk

as a family.

Carthage

I'm not hungry.

VOICE OVER -- Dicky

Whatsa matter? You try to murder

someone today and it didn't work out?

Carthage freezes. She chooses her prettiest dress and sweeps up her hair. When she goes downstairs, Mrs. Mann is clearing the table.

Mrs. Mann

Companion's acting funny. Where is Keeper?

Dicky

Carthage is acting funny, too, like

she's in over her head. Mother, is my

bath ready?

Mrs. Mann

In a minute.

Carthage ignores him and gnaws on a leftover. She looks very beautiful. Dicky loves her, hates her, and is jealous of her all at once.

Mrs. Mann

Where are you going, hun? You absolutely

may not see Willy. Lord only knows what

he's up to.

Dicky

A little target practice?

Mrs. Mann

Stay at home tonight, dear.

Be with us.

Dicky

Why don't you stay home with us, dear,

so you can watch McNabney kill me.

Mrs. Mann

What in heaven's name? Dicky's

going to walk again in just a few

months! Isn't that wonderful?

Carthage faces her mother and brother and exposes the family wound.

Carthage

You don't seem to understand. Father is dead. He's never coming back.

The sound of bathtub water becomes pronounced. As she begins to walk out the door, Dicky in rage leaps up screaming.

Dicky

Oh no you don't!!! Get back here!

He must hobble but he's still very strong. Carthage screams.

Carthage

What? What are you doing?

Mrs. Mann watches in a daze quietly.

Mrs. Mann

Stop that.

Dicky hauls Carthage into the bathroom and plunges her into the running bath, pushing her all the way under. She shrieks as though raped.

Dicky

You're a disgrace. You've ruined my life. You've ruined your own life. You could have had everything with Flowman, but you're a whore.

When Dicky hobbles out, Carthage jumps straight up; the water rushes out of her dress and heels. She's enraged.

Dicky reclines on the stretcher with a smug look on his face. Mrs. Mann rushes to the bathroom as Carthage is coming out. Carthage nearly hits her ineffectual mother. She pushes her mother to the side, still unable to form words. She lets out blasts of syllables as she runs upstairs.

Finally her noise subsides. She dries off. She looks in the mirror; her eye makeup is running and her eyes are fierce. The house is totally silent except for the radio dance music.

Upstairs, the last few sounds of Carthage packing are emphasized: Dresser drawers open and close rapidly, hangers clang together. Carthage slides the Ansel Adams print out of its frame, rolls it up and stuffs it into one of her bags.

She quickly walks downstairs past her family out of the front door. Her perception is dark and blurred.

Dicky reclines; Mrs. Mann sits with her cup of coffee, twiddling her thumbs. It's as though the violence never happened.

VOICE OVER -- Mrs. Mann

Please, Carthage, don't...disappear.

VOICE OVER -- Dicky

She can't go anywhere. She doesn't

have any money.

INT. BANK -- NIGHT.

Inside the dark bank, Carthage piles most of the money into the empty travel bag; the rest goes in the other bag with her belongings. She quietly locks up everything and leaves very calmly.

EXT. HOTEL CELESTE -- NIGHT.

Carthage walks up the stairs and knocks on Willy's door. Willy, at his sweetest and most sensual, answers with a big, "Hello!" He kisses her and she begins to cry. She's furious with Willy.

Willy, feeling her wet hair

What's wrong my dear? What's wrong?

Carthage

You promised.

Willy

What?

He holds her and kisses her.

Willy

What's the matter? For god's sakes, what's eating you?

Carthage

You told him, didn't you! Dicky knows.

Willy

Did he hurt you?

In a daze, Carthage nods yes.

Willy's eyes flash with an idea: He now has two good motives for killing Dicky.

Willy

I oughta kill that son of a bitch.

Carthage frames Willy by putting the key to the bank around his neck.

Carthage

The bank is all yours. Just give me a ride

to the station.

Willy, holding the key

Where are you going? Listen, I'll

take you, but Dicky can't get away with this.

Carthage

No. Don't.

Willy

I just wanna talk to him. Just let me past the dog. I'll hit the bank, then we'll

leave together.

Carthage dawdles in the hallway as Willy finishes dressing. She's exasperated with Willy and his believability. She vows something silently to herself.

Willy quickly and quietly calls McNabney to tell him of his plans to kill Dicky.

Willy, on the phone

I'm doing that job, sir. Then I'm out.

Right? Right? Get your hit man off my ass.

Willy hangs up. He slips a pistol into his jacket. He joins Carthage downstairs.

INT. CAR -- NIGHT.

Willy throws her bags in the back seat. Carthage brings them up front by her side. Willy watches her carefully.

Carthage

You're just going to talk to him, right?

If you were going to kill him, you'd rob the bank first.

Willy laughs nervously at her clear logic.

Willy

Honey, you're a mile ahead of me.

They near the Mann home.

Willy

Dicky still downstairs?

The stretcher.

Carthage, nods yes. She's fearful but trusting of Willy.

EXT. MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

Just as they reach the Mann house, a police car drives by checking on the house. It's dark.

As Willy gets out of the car, he calls her bluff, sending chills through Carthage. She realizes she could now be implicated in Dicky's murder.

Willy

You already hit the bank.

Carthage whistles to the dog to come over to her. She holds her bags and approaches the front gate as he runs up the stairs into the house. The dog barks at him, but Willy quickly disappears inside the front door. Carthage panics and wants to follow but her feet won't move.

Dicky calls to the door from his bed.

VOICE OVER -- Dicky

Carthage? Carthage? I left it unlocked.

INT. MANN HOME -- NIGHT.

Willy steps inside and muffles Dicky's mouth then kills Dicky with one shot. Willy gets blood all over his hands.

EXT. YARD -- NIGHT.

Carthage isn't sure of what she's just heard. She strains to hear. She picks up her bags and runs away from the house into an empty lot of tall grass.

Willy runs outside and chases Carthage with a gun. The dog follows. Willy is scared of the vicious, growling dog.

Willy grabs Carthage and rubs his bloody hands on her blouse. Fearing the huge dog, Willy gently orders her, "Distract him. Run that way." He points in a direction opposite of the way he's going. Carthage registers the strangeness of Willy's request for help.

Carthage hears police sirens approaching from the distance.

Carthage

Is Dicky dead? Did you kill Dick?

Did you?

Suddenly, Willy is afraid of her. He tries to take her bags. He gets one after they wrestle.

Willy

Gimmee the money. Give it to me!

He cries with excitement. Carthage screams, "No! No!" He runs away from her at a ninety degree angle, carrying one of the bags. She doesn't know whether he's got her clothes or the money. She runs to the Reno Club where a cab sits.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT.

Carthage hops in and says, "The Station." She eyes the bag and prays she has the money. She doesn't. Willy got it. She thumbs through the money in her remaining bag, which is more than enough for a train ticket. SIRENS SCREAM around town. The CABBIE casually drives off. Carthage is panting on the quiet ride.

The cabbie checks her out in the rear view mirror. He takes her down the old street where the pharmacy, the perfume shop, and the bank are. Safe inside the cab, Carthage sees a flash of Willy running like hell into his store, breaking in through the large front window for shelter.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT.

His old pals, Fritz and Stubs, fire into him on order by McNabney. Willy tries to hide behind a barrel of alcohol and it ignites. He rushes back out onto the street in flames.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT.

Carthage stares from her window. The flames are reflected on the cab window and superimposed on her face.

EXT. TRAIN -- NEXT MORNING AT SUNRISE.

Carthage stares from the train window as she crosses the Great Plains. The bright sunrise is superimposed on her face, as was the flame the night before. In her memory, she still sees Willy on fire.

Several rows behind her, Frances sits in a dark corner. Neither woman is aware of the other's presence on the train, but, as before, their connection is inevitable.

INT. TRAIN -- DAWN.

A man's hand comes to rest on Carthage's shoulder. She freezes. The man, a STRANGER, excuses himself and walks past her to his seat. Carthage looks at a picture of her father, who now represents both good and evil. With a realistic view of her father, Carthage is now free to be herself.

EXT. TRAIN -- MORNING.

The sun reflects off the train windows, almost blinding Carthage.

INT. TRAIN -- MORNING.

When Carthage opens her eyes in the bright sunlight, she sees a huge, mysterious boulder, resembling the "Monolith at Half Dome" in the middle of a grassy plain. The train chugs on into the distance.

THE END
