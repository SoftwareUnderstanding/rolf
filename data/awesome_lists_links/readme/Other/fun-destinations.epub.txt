### Author's Note

So much going on in today's world is very troubling to me. Why can't we just get along? That's been a central theme in my work. So here goes another book with me trying to ask that ENORMOUS question—that incredibly important inquiry. As I've said before, I reserve the right to plagiarize my own work. Some ideas are worth repeating over and over again.

As always, I thank you for taking this journey of exploration and dissection with me. We've got to insist on figuring out how to get along versus out-superior one another, don't you think?

### Preface

I don't want to brag or anything, but I've won many awards. Many. Okay, I'm bragging. But I have worked super hard to be the best travel agent possible. What kind of travel would you like? Business? Adventurous? Family? Peaceful? Solitude? Luxury? Sport?

What kinds of locations would you like? Exotic, safari, jungle, island, or desert?

How about unique? Mind blowing? Inspirational? Spiritual?

How about a romantic getaway? How does that grab you?

I've got it all. But I'm obligated to tell you, my conscious demands it, STAY AWAY from Earth. I strongly recommend this. That planet is only bad news! Only trouble with a capital T!

### Chapter 1

Fun Destinations Travel Agency

If you're reading this then my document translator is doing a terrific job. I write it in my language and you understand it in yours. Don't you love modern technology?!

Whatever your native tongue is or your species I can help with your travel plans. Whatever planet you're from or spot in our vast universe, I can help with your trips. Let me explain my qualifications. I've been a travel agent for a wee under a century. I, Horizon Sol, know it's not very long but still a century is nothing to sneeze at. And I'll have you know that I have virtually thousands upon thousands of recommendation letters by extremely satisfied customers. And as I've mentioned before, I've got awards from Space Travel Digest, Ride A Comet, Wormhole Destinations, Galaxy Tourism, and Supernova Explosive Adventures to name a few.

Also, I've been the number one travel agent to the stars for quite a few decades in a row. I can help you plan out your next fabulous excursion to almost anywhere...except, I reiterate, Earth.

### Chapter 2

Taco Heaven

So, let me convince you to travel to anywhere else, other than Earth, in the universe. ANYWHERE ELSE! Neptune has the most spectacular views! What about their space oceans? They're truly majestic with waves so high, they envelope you in nature's power. How about traveling to Saturn? Its incomparable rings will take your breath away. How about Venus? Or even Pluto?—not a huge destination spot but I assure you fun nonetheless!

Really, any planet, moon, or constellation is better than where earthlings reside. WAY BETTER! But I do understand that some of you want to visit the birthplace of one of the best things ever created—the TACO. Mmmmmm. Just thinking about this all-inclusive food makes my mouth water.

Mmmmmmmmm.

Still, I must implore you to reconsider your stance on journeying to Earth. I know of the best _taquería_ —taco place—in the whole universe. Well, other than the ones in Mexico, of course. But let me point out that this Mexican eatery has something the Earth ones don't—taco fillings from all over the universe! You just haven't lived until you eat vegetarian from Saturn, fish from Neptune, or cows raised in the winds of Mars, or other fillings from so many other planets. And what about SALSA! Supernova salsa is literally out of this world! Literally! It explodes in your mouth with flavor!

This wonderful taco truck is usually located right by Jupiter, at the corner of—why don't I just e-mail you the address with directions. I'd be happy to if you so do wish to nourish yourself at Mex-Space Tacos.

Have I convinced you of desisting in traveling to Earth? I suggest a virtual tour instead if you feel you simply must go there. These types of tours feel so unbelievably real. New technology is sooo amazing. I implore you not to knock this type of travel until you've tried it. BUT if you insist on trekking over to the tiny planet, then I'll have to put my foot down when it comes to your kids.

I WILL NOT ARRANGE THOSE TICKETS!

Not on a spaceship. Not on a Metro. Not on a rocket. Not on... Not on ANYTHING! In good conscience I cannot be the one who arranges for your little ones to visit that horrid place. You should see what many earthlings do to children! How they square all type of horrors in their own minds to excuse an evil they refuse to see.

Believe it or not, I do understand that some of you are fascinated with that backwards place because to be very honest, much greatness has come from it. NOT greatness in the sense so many humans define it as full of arrogant power but the way most of us in the universe and some enlightened earthlings have learned to comprehend it. The act of sharing power instead of grabbing it at all costs.

I also understand how some of you want to visit the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez, Maya Angelou, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sitting Bull, Gandhi, Mandela and the like. I can go on and on naming these GREAT human _beings_ who were imperfect like the rest of us but their greatness outshone their imperfections by far. Yes, I know how tempting to want to visit their home and personally check out how they reached their awesomeness.

BUT let me tell you about this horrible place and why I say it's terrible. Put on your travel gear—it's going to be a bumpy ride of mindboggling insights. There are just so many silly, silly creatures on that planet.

So very many!

### Chapter 3

Earth

Deep in the universe is a teensy, tiny planet called Earth. A minuscule dot. Some say a pretty insignificant one, but I do have manners and my parents raised me right so I won't personally insult that world. Besides, it is a very majestic place full of incredible beauty in its nature—it's not at fault for being the residence of so many silly creatures. So many vain and arrogant mortals.

This incredibly beautiful place is chock full of certain foolish creatures who are hastening their own demise with their inability to learn from their own past mistakes—their gobbledygook of games to out-superior one another instead of getting along. Their gobbledygook of _gladiator_ arrogance.

Can you believe that at one time, earthlings actually thought that the sun revolved around them?! HA!

AND they kill their own! You heard right! They kill their own in their narcissistic obsession for power. Yet, they have all the wisdom they need from wise individuals on that planet and from a loving parent Creator BUT so many of them choose to create a hater's world. To poison their very souls this way! Exploding stars!—how ridiculous is that?

I know what you're thinking and what you want to ask me, "But, Horizon, you're almost identical to earthlings except for your bright green coloring."

Of which I answer, "Maybe the box God put me in, my body, is similar, but there are soooo many differences. You'll see what I'm talking about when I finish explaining."

### Chapter 4

Cycle of Human Life

So here goes the human being blueprint:

Our Creator

/

Birth/Babyhood —just arrived from God in celestial beauty and sure of themselves in their infancy. The self-preservation of basic needs makes sense here.

/

innate soul message of love growing-fuzzy in a nebula of all kinds of human brainwash and gobbledygook sinking in.

/

obsession with superiority self-preservation kicks in with an astronomical asteroid of double helpings of brainwash.

/

Youth—figuring their world as they fiercely fight not to disappear into nothingness. Hormones and testosterone raging. Trying to land on their very own cosmic ray.

/

Adulthood—still figuring out life. Still morbidly afraid of not being validated. Raging superiority games.

/

Middle-age—either they gather mature knowledge together in a constellation of wisdom or eschew it in an eternal struggle to keep youth. To not get old.

/

Old age—either arrived like on a shooting star at open-minded wisdom or double downed on the deep dumbness of locked superiority stubbornness. Self-preservation at its cataclysmic new meaning of fixed and fixation identity.

/

Death—back to God to answer to questions of whether their visit to Earth had been about the bettering of the soul in an aurora of colors OR the black hole of superiority arrogance. Helped the human family? Or insisted on a plethora of hatred games of _us_ vs. _them_?

### Chapter 5

Complicated Creatures

So all of us _beings_ in the universe have grown to rely on each other's brilliance—including Earth's. Too bad humans haven't learned to rely on one another within their very own planet!

Anyway, the late great Earth basketball coach Don Haskins said that _basketball is a simple game played by complicated players._ Let's switch that out to _life on Earth is a simple game played by complicated players (earthlings)_.

A simple game played by complicated players!

A great many human beings complicate everything. EVERYTHING. No wonder so many of these silly creatures turn to simplistic answers to multi-faceted questions, but more on this later! Anyway, earthlings need to realize how they can easily complicate themselves right out of human existence in a supernova explosion of epic proportions. An apocalypse of their own making.

These particular silly creatures are born with their best foot forward and then everything goes to gobbledygook after that. To prove my point, I give you the tremendous _smarts_ of babies. The rest of us have learned to harness the wisdom of these little ones. They have it right from the beginning. They innately know how to live life since they just came from our Creator and even though they have certain DNA, they haven't been polluted and brainwashed yet—that gobbledygook comes later. Their self-preservation instincts of primary needs make sense at this point before the brainwash of superiority self-preservation sets in. Before it becomes a nuclear fusion of disgusting and poisonous gobbledygook.

Babies don't cry when their parents desist from diapering them with the latest in galaxy baby-wear. Instead, they cry when they're uncomfortable. It doesn't matter to them if they're wearing costly apparel only found in certain elite corners of the universe. In other words, it certainly doesn't improve their self-esteem to dress them in expensive frocks made exclusively at the House of Supernova.

They don't go around thinking, 'Hey, look at me. I'm really something—superior to you because of my superior double star garments. I'm in a much higher electromagnetic spectrum class than you.' They don't examine their milk before drinking it to make certain it's of the gourmet Super Solar System kind. Instead, they cry when they're hungry. They don't look at their parents and say—'I can't love you because you're fat, ugly, or a loser. Where's your fireball brightness?' They don't make judgements like that because they haven't been polluted with those ugly, judgmental thoughts yet that earthlings are famous for in the whole universe.

They haven't been told yet, brainwashed, with the pollution of what's beauty. Man-made ideas of attractiveness. Babies have just come from God, our Creator, so they still understand what beauty really is. Instead, they feel the gorgeousness of love for whoever takes care of them in gamma-ray-like bursts of happiness. They reflect love back for the right reasons. They don't cry because of radiation pressured insecurities. Those spiraling insecurities take hold later, but for the moment they are still filled with the Creator's luminosity of unadulterated love.

They don't ask themselves with massive star fury who in the room is belittling them. They don't obsess over how to get back at the person who is being ugly to them. They don't do mental gymnastics covered in thick nebula in pondering how to get unbridled admiration for the old light of their now dead stars. They don't care about that. Because of a vibrant connection to God, they know the truth about that fading light. And that they don't need admiration for this fleeting light from those who surround them.

The monetary cost of material things is of not even a molecule of importance to them unless it affects them directly. That their parents put them in an old jalopy of a transportation vehicle instead of an expensive luxury one is of little importance to them unless the jalopy keeps breaking down, and they're stranded somewhere. They don't sit in the old mode of travel and say, 'My parents don't care enough about me to spend real money on me in a posh vehicle. What will all the other babies think of me in this absolute zero thing? How will I lift my head? My pulsar pride is ruined."

They sleep soundly in an eclipse lullaby unless there's a health issue or emotional disorder in the home. How many older humans have trouble with their slumber not only because of worry for the basic necessities but also because of black hole supposed necessities that obscure truths? Babies have no inferiority complexes—not yet. They may have microns of it in their DNA, but it hasn't been brought out yet. It's still in somewhat of a rest until insecurities start microwaving it.

Babies don't complicate love by putting conditions with it and by turning it into an obsession. By changing the fabric of its very beauty by collapsing it into a neutron star. They don't wonder about giving or taking away love from their parents. They simply give love because they're overflowing with it. Simple. But not simplistic. No, not superficially simplistic at all. Their self-preservation instincts are quite logical. Older human beings cluster up the basic needs and the superiority physiological needs. Mix them up into a nuclear mass.

Human rancid thoughts floating like light pollution through the universe:

"I need a mansion." Alert: A living space may be needed but not a mansion. "I need to be famous." Alert: You need love around you but fame has nothing to do with it. "I need many things." Alert: You actually need far less things that you think you do.

Those things can never ever define our value on any planet. Our Creator has already assessed our value and it has got nothing to do if we've been dipped in gold or in water! Babies prove that!

Babies cry when something is actually wrong—their tummies or other parts are hurting, they're hungry or thirsty, their diapers are dirty, or they sense a deep unhappiness in their homes. Yes, they can ingest what's happening in the household—good or bad. And either get overwhelmingly content _or_ miserably unhappy with what's occurring to those who surround them.

Then as babies start growing and getting brainwashed with fear, the innate knowledge of their souls starts getting fuzzy. Let the complications begin. Fear of not belonging. Fear of not being valuable, fear of not being validated. In other words—fear of not self-preserving. Not finding their safety place. Not being in their comfort zone.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

not taking advantage of the wisdom of babies,

so therefore complicating their very existence,

preferring to self-destruct in gobbledygook,

living a fear-based life.

Such silly creatures—so many of them.

### Chapter 6

Self-Preservation

Preserving of self is the name of the game of all _beings_ big and small. All of us do that! So ALL of God's creatures fight to self-preserve. Fight to exist in one way or another. Self-preservation is the magic word of existence. None of us wants to end up in a black hole! Or even in a vortex of a never-ending mass swirling towards nothingness!

That goes without saying.

Everything we universe creatures do, everything we are, everything we believe becomes about self-preservation.

All creatures of the universe really need a sense of purpose. But we often mix it with fear. Purpose and fear. Ugh! I can't stress the damage in FEAR-thinking enough! So I'll mention it again.

Fear of hunger, fear of lack of shelter, fear of the necessities not being met, fear of never finding someone to love us for who we are.

Fear of not being happy.

Fear of not being important enough, fear of being laughed at, fear of being taken advantage of, fear of being betrayed, fear of being lonely, fear of being misunderstood, fear of failure, fear of success.

Fear that if we give up power, we give up ourselves, Fear of others taking what should be ours. Fear that if _they_ win, we lose.

_Us_ vs. _them._

The rest of us universe _beings_ faced the question of our fears a long time ago. FACED IT! But many humans have had no such self-reflection, so they haven't been able to self-correct. As a result, they swim and drown in fear.

FEAR of not being good enough.

So brainwash becomes easy. Reality becomes muddy and blurry since they filter it through situations, status, and fear. Can you believe that the perception of truth unfortunately becomes their reality? PERCEPTION! Yep, perception of TRUTH—can you fathom this? You can see how the delusions rush in after this perception as reality becomes their way of viewing the world.

The obsession for self-preservation can be so massive that it's so very easy to make themselves believe that anything not feeding into the importance of their identity is a huge threat, that anything fighting against their comfort zone will melt them—leaving them nobodies and in nothingness. Black hole territory here!

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

not having realized the importance that self-preservation plays in their lives—the good and evil it unleashes.

Oh, silly, silly human beings.

Oh, the games people play.

Oh, the brainwash they believe.

### Chapter 7

Gender

And what plays into their self-preservation terrors? In other words, what affects their identity ginormously? What influences their cultures so very much?

Gender differences.

So I beg you—if you're a female, please don't go to Earth. If you insist you absolutely have to go then I'll very reluctantly arrange for it because you're adults and I have to respect your decisions. But I won't let you go without warning you first. You must be absolutely aware of what you're getting into.

Of the horrors that await you on Earth!

See, that backwards planet doesn't understand equality. NOR DOES IT WANT TO! This is a huge problem with different ethnicities of which I will cover later but for now I want to discuss how females haven't for the most part gotten full equality or in some cases even partial equality on that planet.

It's a HUGE travesty of justice, I tell you!

A great many humans don't want to face this travesty because the gender in charge of so much of that planet doesn't want to lose its power, and many of the female persuasion have been brainwashed of their own supposed inferiority, _or_ they just want to side with power.

Unfortunately, earthlings have always been fueled by toxic masculine testosterone.

Before anyone gets all kinds of defensive and accuses me of being a male hater, please take a breath. I know no one likes to be blamed for things, but let me remind you I said TOXIC masculine testosterone. Not _all_ male testosterone. There's a ginormous difference in positive male testosterone and the toxic kind.

I also want to remind you about what we, universe _beings_ , already know. We figured this out a long time ago. The universe is fueled by female energy and male energy. FUEL. The sharing of both energies balance the universe.

In other words—it balances out God's creation. Us.

Earth is not balanced out! Its enormous unbalances are due to their unwillingness to share power. If this creation can't share power then the whole planet is off kilter!

Pope Francis said, "Lose so that everyone can win." But toxic masculinity is obsessed with winning at all costs. Gladiator mentality: ' _There can only be one winner. If you win then I lose. All of us can't be winners.'_

They call it a zero-sum game.

So Earth is stuck on a toxic testosterone game—a tape that keeps replaying over and over again through time. Their history is full of this mess.

And when certain women get into positions of power, they may use male energy instead of their own. It's extraordinarily hard to have to play a game that's not yours, a game that someone else made up with its specific rules and nuances. And their world is mostly a man's world. Their games of survival are made up by toxic male testosterone—no question.

Female earthlings have thoroughly been brainwashed about their value on that planet! It's sooo amazing to watch such gobbledygook. Thank goodness many are waking up to this manipulative sham! Unfortunately, many but not all.

We've come to understand that the female gender was not created to be scenery!—not meant to be just seen and without a voice!

Females are NOT toys!

As if our Creator told us what physical beauty was and what type we had to adhere to! Superiority of shapes, sizes, color—pure gobbledygook, I tell you!

Oh, and what about this business that females are not meant to lead. How ridiculous is that? Should I not be the owner and manager of my business because I'm a she and not a he?

RIDICULOUS!

The world humans built does so much harm to females: groping, rapes, slavery, murder, beatings, invalidating, and so forth. The list goes on and on! When toxic testosterone is interrupted, women seem an easy target and then laws don't do much to protect them since toxic male power doesn't empathize with females. It considers them secondary citizens—even while extolling certain virtues. This charade of praises is so it doesn't face what it's actually doing to womankind. Throw out some cute compliments of permitted attributes in the brainwash game of giving females their due.

All women on that planet should yell—enough!

Females aren't meant to be playthings, trophies, or the shiny toys. They're certainly not meant to be indentured servants. Females weren't created to make men powerful. _Or_ even to make them _feel_ powerful. All of us, female and male, are in the universe for growth purposes, and not just for lovers and for marriage. Females are mothers, sisters, aunts, doctors, teachers and so forth.

A female's role in the universe is HUGE. I don't know why Earth makes it so small—oh, wait, I do know. TOXIC TESTOSTERONE!

An unbalance of epic proportions!

This toxic poison that steamrolls over women—yells SUPER LOUDLY when its power is threatened.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

so against equality,

so obsessed in controlling women and their bodies,

so threatened by strong women,

so wrapped up in their toxic testosterone identities.

Such silly creatures indeed.

### Chapter 8

Scapegoating

Have I got a lot to say about scapegoating! Scapegoating females is practically a sport in that world!

Earthlings often use differences to scapegoat each other because of their insecurities, fears, and manipulations. Scapegoating the female gender is one of the main ways to keep status quo and world power culture in place. Yeah, blame the girl or woman for male weakness because in a gladiator world, he-man strength is everything. In a zero-sum game, there can only be one winner—' _if I'm weak, I'm losing because you're strong_.'

' _So if I can't contain my carnal desires then it's her fault for tempting me—what was she wearing? That doesn't happen to good women.'_

' _It's her fault—ALWAYS her fault.'_

' _We know better since we're the strong gender.'_

' _Stone her.'_

I will say that males also have it tough on that planet with the rules they themselves have created. What roles do they feel they have to play? Protector? Ruler? Main decision maker? Major bread winner? And because of the delusion of masculine superiority so entrenched in their world view, their whole sense of being is tied to these plastic roles and thus creating more delusions to uphold their sense of who they are—their identity which they obsessively hold onto with white knuckles.

It's a vicious cycle. It completely takes over their world. Toxic masculinity has disrupted the rhythm of life. The violence of the alpha male in being the superior gender has placed humanity in the middle of a dangerous vortex of annihilation.

They are destroying themselves with their gobbledygook! Their obsession to keep power in a specific place at ALL costs! Their silly definition of strength! Their silly obsession with it!

Exploding stars! You should see what earthlings do to strong females! If these girls and women don't fit within their little human box, these power abusers do everything to take them down and certain other foolish females buy into this horror in order to side with power and keep their own silly control within this mess. The brainwash of repeating over and over any imperfections these power hungry abusers can dig up of strong females, when most of the time these hypocrites have done much worse.

Again, humans have made scapegoating females into an art form. Males are forgiven much easier than females for the very same things.

' _Stone her!'_

For the most part their worldwide culture is much, much harder on females. MUCH.

How can anyone possibly think that a creation that creates goes at the bottom of the importance ladder while unbalanced aggressiveness goes on top? Again—this insistence on conquering the universe, of being king of the mountain, will destroy humans!

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

hating on women's strength,

obsessed with their own toxicity.

Oh, so very silly, silly earthlings,

so threatened by strong females,

who don't bow down to them.

Scapegoating them to bring them down a peg or two.

Not facing the evil of inequality.

Will they learn to share power?

### Chapter 9

Superiority Thinking

So how do the toxic games begin? If only earthlings would understand all the silly games they are manipulated into playing against one another. The seeds of bigotry and implicit bias grow fervently on this ground of the _differences game_ that is based on superiority to soothe their fears.

Superiority—their toxic default setting. What destructive gobbledygook!

Superiority games are at the basis to everything so very many humans do. EVERYTHING within every atom of their troublesome existence. And then their delusions begin with their trying to define who they are and obsessing over who other humans think they are. Such optics! Phony lenses and mirrors!

Earthlings start carrying a measuring stick they tell themselves is made from supposed moral standards but actually is made from the insecurities, fears, and anxieties of a loss of identity that leads to all sorts of poisonous delusions. They measure one another in terms of lack instead of empathizing with one another. Instead of finding their common humanity and growing with their differences. It's hate and fear verses LOVE. Love that is meant to flow with each universe _being_ instead of obsessively stealing from one another.

_Better versus superior_. That's the cosmic game. Unfortunately, superior wins with so many of these silly creatures.

How do you like them comets?

They often make the error of assuming their self-worth depends on superiority to others (another gender, another person, another family, another ethnicity, another country). Here's the measuring stick game. Exploding stars! Thank heavens we stopped that gobbledygook a long time ago or the universe would've been in deep trouble with Galactic wars popping up all over the place causing ENORMOUS destruction.

I mean, our advanced weaponry makes Earth's weapons look like toys. And you should see how vain some of these humans are about their so-called advanced civilization and the toys of materialism. The way they lord their gobbledygook of so-called superiority over one another—it's disgusting! HA!

I know you must be wondering why these foolish creatures base themselves on the shortcomings of others. These defects being mostly about opinion and not fact. Will the so- called imperfections of others actually make these earthlings better _beings_? Of course not! What self-preservation gobbledygook!

Self-preservation obsessions can lead to self-esteem issues. What goes into self-esteem becomes problematic for many human beings. They confuse self-preservation with identity concerns. Instead of doing what our Creator demands of us—to become better _beings_ , they confuse better with superiority. How silly is that? To entangle self-preservation with superiority.

How do you like them comets?

In order to self-preserve they start obsessing over being good enough. Fighting to be somebodies. Fighting to be heard. Fighting to be winners. Those self-esteem issues become about winning gladiator games in the brainwash that there can only be ONE winner. Just one!

As I said before—a zero sum game! So everything becomes about superiority. Their homes— superiority. Their vehicles—superiority. Their clothes—superiority. Their jobs—superiority. Their friends—superiority. Their politics—superiority. Their ideas—superiority. Their loves—superiority. Their circles—superiority. Their genders—superiority. Their racial make-up—superiority. Their cultures—superiority. Their religion—superiority. Their God—superiority. EVERYTHING!

" _My God is superior to yours."_

" _I'm a winner then you must be a loser."_ A zero sum game. _"If I'm superior, you're inferior and everything about you has to be inferior in order for me to win and keep my superiority but I won't face what I'm actually doing. I'll make a pretzel out of my mind excusing what I'm doing because I don't want to be a bad person."_ And the, _"I'm not a bigot, I'm not a bad person, I'm a good person,"_ game begins. More on this silly delusion later.

Instead of self-preserving the way babies do with the basic needs like food, shelter, air, sleep, air, and water, and love of course, humans obsess over their other needs of validation, self-esteem, respect, and self-actualization!

The primary necessities of humans of food, shelter, air, water, and love, unfortunately, get complicated with the spiraling obsessions of superiority. All their needs become jumbled together—physical necessities for survival—and all others of love, belongingness, safety, self-actualization suddenly revolve around self-esteem and what makes up self-esteem. Their souls pinch them on the inside to get them to go with becoming BETTER earthlings but instead, their self-esteem becomes about self-aggrandizement through silly toys and silly wealth _. Superiority thinking_. Babies would show them the way if only humanity would allow for it. _Soul pinches._

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

not taking an example of true self-preservation survival from their babies,

spreading misery within and also outward in their silly superiority thinking.

Oh, such silly, silly creatures,

ruining themselves and their whole planet with such evil shenanigans.

Instead of realizing that in order to self-preserve and have good self-esteem,

they need not to become superior people,

but to become better human beings instead.

Oh, silly, silly creatures,

fighting for self-preservation and confusing it's emotions,

conflating them with their insecurities.

" _Lose so that everyone can win."—Pope Francis_

### Chapter 10

Others

Armed with _superiority thinking_ , human beings take self-preservation to a whole new level. A mega-silly SAMENESS level. The delusion of safety within sameness is a HUGE one for so many earthlings. They yearn to be safe from all the instability they themselves help create. So if the problem lies in someone else's beliefs then they don't have to question their own ideas—they can stay comfortable in their own space. Their own space of superiority.

In their space, the meteorite shower is grand, beautiful, and superior while the meteorite shower in another's yard must be dangerous—inferior and scary and must be taken care of ASAP!

Earthlings feel safe within their own ideas, their own culture, their own class, their own nation, their own city, their own town, their own home, their own space. Safe within their sense of identity so they PRESERVE it at all times. Safe within their sameness and not realizing when it becomes a _tyranny of the sameness_. A **superiority tyranny of sameness**!

Differences can be absolutely frightening to them. Can you believe it? But let me explain why they feel that way. Differences can take humans into the unknown and detonate their comfort zone in a supernova explosion. Their sameness creates a sham sense of security while differences shock their individuality, so the identity they created is threatened.

Threatened!

Threatened!

THREATENED!

So the sameness self-preservation virus kicks in that poisons so many of them into thinking that in order to preserve their identity, others have to think like they do, be like them, and look like them. Others need to conform to what they think is great, to conform to their silly measuring stick, in order for them to feel valid because differences challenge them about themselves. See how the toxicity of _superiority thinking_ plays a major role here?

How do you like them comets?

So now that they have entangled self-preservation issues with self-esteem ones, they easily glide right into the gobbledygook of _superiority thinking_. That way it soothes their vain pride, ties their identity to superiority games that only damage them, and messes with their minds about what they are there on Earth to do. GROW.

Can you imagine doubling down on such deep dumbness instead of grabbing onto growth? Where would we be if we insisted on obsessing over the twinkle of certain stars when they've already died?

" _But they're still alive! They're twinkling! That's the truth! I see it with my own two eyes! Truth! Truth! Truth!—"_

NO! That's not the truth. We may be able to see the twinkle but those stars are dead. STOP doubling down on such deep dumbness!

Instead, it's _, "Get out of my way—it's me before you!"_

Humans use differences to create delusions that lead to _us_ against _them_? Inferior them. Superior us.

The question is—who are the _others_ and who are the _us_?

As earthlings on that teensy tiny globe, it's mindboggling why they constantly speak in terms of _others!_ It's so very difficult for them to understand that the _others_ eat, bleed, and breathe like them. The _others_ need love, companionship, and a sense of self like them.

But the _others_ may do these things differently than they would.

The _others_ who eat differently, live differently and value differently. The _others_ who raise their children differently, rest differently, worship God differently,

All _beings_ are always an _other_ to somebody. _AN_ _OTHER._ Somebody outside our circle.

Let me explain this concept this way. With a true story of mine:

See, I do what I always do to offer the best travel packages—by testing what I'm selling. I had decided to go to Earth. I was really excited! I was going to go there for the first time ever and would finally meet earthlings. I really had no idea what I was in for.

I chose my human being disguise because even though I basically look human, my green coloring would have freaked them out. I chose a lovely mocha coloring similar to that of my cousin's, even though hers is much brighter.

While on the blue planet, I was in total awe. It's really a beautiful place—especially its oceans, in my opinion. Well, I was as happy as can be as I stepped into a seafood place at the beach when a police officer approached me as I was waiting for my order at my table. He started asking me a whole bunch of questions. It turned out the waiter had called the police because according to the manager, I looked, 'suspicious'.

I was asked to leave the premises and never come back! At first I was petrified with worry that I wasn't playing human very well and that they were suspecting who I really was—from another planet. I changed my human being camouflage to try it again. This time I chose a sienna coloring to switch things around a bit, and I went over all my human training. I stepped over to the seafood eatery again. Wouldn't you know—the same thing happened again! And let me make it clear that even though I was in a different facade, I still got thrown out of the place. When I was outside, a person with my same coloring told me that the manager was a bigot bigtime.

Pretty racist!

But the human race is really only one race—human! Right? So why the gobbledygook? What's up with that?

Anyway, I wish I could tell you that this incident was isolated. But stuff like this happens on Earth all the time I tell you—and a lot worse! Killings, massacres, hate crimes, power abuses, hate laws, politician sell-outs, status quo inflexibility, rapes, injustices and etc. And all because of willful ignorance, willful blindness, and willful gobbledygook.

Superiority blindness willfulness!

Exploding stars!

_Superiority thinking_ is their actual religion. Yes, their **actual** religion.

Superiority games!

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings.

So VERY afraid of the OTHERS,

of losing their superiority identity to the OTHERS,

of sharing power with the OTHERS,

of realizing that the tyranny of the sameness is precisely that—a tyranny,

_of facing that the Creator also created the others for His human fam_ ily.

Chapter 11

The Bigotry Cycle

Our Creator for all/the universe—home of all

/

Birth/babyhood—in this new formation of a _being_ , self-preservation is about basic needs.

/

Innate soul message of love and growth growing fuzzy as human propensity for being creatures of habit sets in.

/

Habit—stay in the place you're in. Limited points of view. Finding it difficult to put yourself in someone else's shoes. Viola!—seeds of bigotry.

/

Seeds of bigotry collide with superiority self-preservation—the self-preservation beyond basic needs that ties security with identity.

/

Youth—feels like a massive star explosion inside. Figuring their world as all kinds of brainwash sets in their minds. Brainwash of what to look like, who to admire, and what makes up the best, of worthiness.

/

Adulthood—morbidly fearful of not being validated in the whole cosmos. Also, fearful of not being a good child of the Creator, so vehemently reject any mention of bigotry. Reject even having the seeds of it, "I don't have a racist bone in my body."

/

So seeds of bigotry grow in the darkness. GROW. They grow in secrecy of darkness that adamantly does not recognize itself unless the _being_ chooses to recognize this evil and prevent it from growing.

/

While growing older, how much growth is actually taking place? Or how much growth is taking place in seeds of bigotry? What kind of secret galaxy is forming inside a _being_? Secrets full of brainwash.

/

Death—back to the creator who wants to know how you treated the rest of His familyhood? Self-reflection anyone? Superiority games, fear, and staying in your old orbit exclusively equals bigotry. What's your spin to make bigotry okay? What happened when you're galaxy of secrets collided with someone else's galaxy?

_IN A NUTSHELL_ : from being born in God's love _to_ self-preservation _to_ confusing BETTER with SUPERIORITY _to_ bigotry.

### Chapter 12

_Bigotry_

How hard is it to understand that the seeds of bigotry are everywhere? How they are inherent in every _being_ in the universe because where you are is exactly how you view the world.

Let's say you're on a galactic mountain. If you're at the bottom you'll have a much clearer view at details there than if you're at the top and vice-versa. Where you're at is through what lenses you view. So, how important do you think is asking a universe _being_ what they see from their corner instead of insisting you know best from your spot? If you argue you don't see it so therefore it doesn't exist then what is happening is that you don't want to listen to someone else's viewpoint about themselves.

Sounds a bit funny when it's put that way, huh? How do you like them comets?

But very many humans are known all through the universe for such foolish gobbledygook.

Ugh!

These foolish creatures refuse to recognize the inherent bias in themselves—in everybody!

YES, EVERYBODY!

If they refuse to recognize this and not look beyond their tiny corner, in other words—beyond their blind spots, then of course they'll say they don't see it—bigotry. How can they see something they refuse to get out of their teensy tiny space to view? Something they REFUSE to see.

Something that'll dare challenge their _superiority thinking_.

Their identity wrapped in it.

Of course, they'll likely not admit to refusing to get enlightened or even to a superiority identity. They may even get indignant and furious at the mere mention of them, but there will be _soul pinches._

" _I'm not a bad person, but I don't see the bigotry. Can't see it."_

Of which I'd answer, _"It's not happening to you. What do you care?"_

And they'll likely get even more furious and indignant. DEFENSIVE. They'll try to convince whoever is listening how they supposedly care and how they give money to such and such charities and on and on. They may even throw in how they're actually the ones who are the real victims of bigotry. This is how earthlings with privilege REFUSE to SEE. Refuse to recognize their own privilege.

EXPLODING STARS!

So many humans make these lame points because they don't know what's inside them. Secret thoughts even from themselves because of willful blindness. Secret thoughts created by nature, nurture, and environment. Brainwash!

What they are really saying is, _"I don't know why you don't agree with me on my superiority?"_

Double exploding stars!

Sorry, but I must turn to _sarcasm_ here:

Hmmm—now why would anybody not want to give up their rights as a universe _being_? How unusual that they don't realize that even though history is written by those who win so therefore make themselves look grand and others bad, forget that and succumb to my superiority.

' _Forget that to the victors the spoils go—credit for everything.'_

ZERO-SUM GAME.

Forget fairness as defined by anyone other than myself and those like me.

ZERO-SUM GAME.

Forget what hatred really is because I'm not a hater. I'm not a bad human being but my kind is good and your kind is traditionally bad.

_ZERO-SUM GAME_.

How very, very bizarre that they want equality.

I don't know why they don't agree with me on my superiority. Why would that be?

How unusual for the 'them' not to think like me. To use my logic. To see things exactly as I see them. To not agree with my secret thoughts—to not use my superiority ideas.

Triple exploding stars!

So what a complete surprise that universe _beings_ want to be what our Creator created us to be—equal. Sharing power. Sharing the planet. Sharing vision.

How unusual that universe _beings_ want to be appreciated and not stepped on and also not merely tolerated.

Celebrate one another—not the evil stuff, of course. Not the evil of superiority but celebrate the good of equality.

How strange that universe _beings_ protest, fight, and insist on their rights as they experience the inherent bias and bigotry in their everyday lives.

EXPLODING STARS!

So here is the thing with bigotry: I repeat—everyone has seeds of it. Everyone! Stop fighting me on this one—you're wrong and if you don't realize it you'll make matters worse not only for yourself but for ALL _beings_ in the universe. Inherent bias DOES exist. Exists big time.

The secret of you being a good _being_ is that you recognize this and mobilize yourself to make up for it. Question yourself frequently of—where did that thought come from? Why do I feel this way? Who taught me that? How do I know that? Are my insecurities ruling me? Am I excusing hate? What are my secret thoughts?

What kind of gobbledygook am I programmed to believe in to keep the rich getting richer and the powerful in their status quo place?

Oh, I almost forgot to mention this since this subject really gets me going. For your information:

YOU can still be a bigot even if you're not and have never been associated with an extremist group. I strongly suggest you stop thinking in absolutes. YOU can still be a bigot if you're married to an _other._ Yep, it's true. You can still be a bigot if you have children and grandchildren with that spouse. You may think your spouse is an exception to their group or that you're just plainly superior to them in your secret space of denial or even out in the open. As for children or grandchildren, they may be exceptions in your mind—saved by your superiority.

YOU can still be a bigot while having friends, acquaintances, and coworkers belonging to the _others_ group in your mind _._ You may fill your mouth with how you don't treat the _them_ differently, that you're such a fair and good person. You may see the _them_ in your circle as again, the exception.

YOU can even be a bigot against your own. What?! Yes, it's true. Uncle Tom, anyone? You may side with power and be power's faithful doggie throwing you an occasional bone all the while using you for cover—"Of course, I'm not a bigot? How dare you even say so? Such and such is my friend."

" _I'm not a bad person."_

And you should see how these bigotry deniers jump their thoughts like frogs from one lily pad to another, so they don't stay on a thought too long—staying in the superficial and not going in too deep. In other words—not going into their secret thoughts.

No examination of their secret thoughts. No self-reflection. No attention to their _soul pinches._

They know it's wrong, or they'd stopped talking so fast, making so many excuses, defending their superficial ideas, muddying the waters, obfuscating, misdirecting, and denying.

Leapfrogging their thoughts. And working extra hard to stay in the generalities where stereotypes thrive and away from the specifics of truth.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

with seeds of bigotry inside them,

but refusing to recognize these poisonous seedlings,

since bigotry would make them bad people.

So instead of waking up,

and preventing growth,

and battling with the brainwash of the superficial,

they battle with the OTHER, the THEM.

Oh such silly creatures,

with their leapfrogging thoughts,

and their sweeping generalizations,

staying away from the truth in specifics.

So very silly, silly earthlings,

not realizing that the smart person, the BETTER human being,

will constantly test their own seeds of bigotry blind spots.

Chapter 13

Power and Money

Let me remind you of another HUGE truth we've come to realize—power is the umbrella term for all other delusions. It gets entangled with ego and pride. Power. It's what the universe runs on. But Godly power is extraordinarily different from earthlings' puny sense of power. Very puny!

When humans say that money makes the world go round, it's really earthly power they're talking about because money is power to them. Power is what so many of them think brings importance, greatness, and respect.

Isn't it obvious that the more insecure, the more obsessions with power grow? To us it is.

So power becomes about success. Intertwines with it. Success. But how do humans define this multi-pronged word? Have lots and lots of money. A huge title. Much status. That's success to them. But is it to God?

Or is it the culture of the rich?

The culture of the rich where value as a _being_ is placed squarely on the material. Ugh! Now, to be fair, not all who are wealthy participate in this delusion. And, by the way, there are plenty of those who aren't moneyed who _do_ entangle their identities in the culture of the rich. Ugh!

How do you like them comets?

That their value is about money, things, status, and such. That they're less valuable and therefore less than a _being_ if they don't fall within those silly trappings.

Ugh!

Instead of believing in the value of empathy, sharing, and kindness toward God's family, what's truly valuable is confused with silly material trappings.

This ridiculous silliness is CONFLATED with success!

But let me tell you about the great question so many humans never ask: is success really about _acting_ important or being important?

_Act_ important: Do they want to be admired and fawned over—a forever black hole of insecurity?

OR

_Be_ important: Do they want to better their _beings_ by using success to help others?

Let's look at what _we've_ learned about success:

So much of what certain humans do is truly important like taking care of their immediate and outside families, saying a kind word to someone in need, extending a helping hand, and spreading their good fortune. They are often at their best when their guards are down. They're not concentrating on who is trying to take away from them, and they freely open up their hearts and wallets because they have a tendency to help. Their souls are free to do what they sense they should, to connect to the rest of humanity (their sisters and brothers).

But unfortunately this isn't the emphasis in their world. ERRR! So few awards and attention are placed on the importance of helping others. So much is put on _appearing t_ o be POWERFUL, _appearing_ to be a HERO, _appearing_ to be GREAT. _Appearing_ bigger than others becomes more important than actually doing something important.

ERRR! ICK! Exploding stars!

And there's practically no bigger importance delusion than the one that goes with wealth. Yeah, we know that misbelief well and have self-corrected, but humans just don't get it about the evil of this delusion.

The culture of the rich!

Such gobbledygook! Have lots and lots of money to buy lots and lots of toys. Big, expensive, and opulent toys that will demonstrate their supposed superiority to other earthlings. That way superficial, misguided humans can fawn over them as often happens when people meet affluent people. While toys are fun, if they have to use them to play superiority games, they need to reconsider such silliness of impressing those with such shallow gobbledygook, don't you think?

So very many human beings and their gross superiority behaviors. Their silly beliefs!

Ponder this—who needs deodorant, decency, and wisdom when they're rich because so many clueless people will give them all the positive traits they can think of like: _'Rich people are so smart. Rich people are so brave. Rich people are so much more awesome than the rest of us.'_ And so on and on and on and on ... Even siding with the rich at **ALL** costs! Siding with certain greedy rich humans who steal, plunder, and gobble up everything. Siding with silly human power instead of with empathy, love, kindness and then blaming their misfortunes because of the wealth plunder on the _others_. The same _others_ of different cultures because it's much easier to scapegoat their misery than facing the _tyranny of the sameness_ and the worship of the rich.

ERRR! What gobbledygook! Ick!

It's so very easy to assume that money is the biggest blessing—the most important blessing given by our Creator so therefore a way to judge others as to their importance. Their value. If not an outright judgment, a secret thought. A secret feeling. A secret assumption. It is very easy to assume that happiness is squarely within money. Who wouldn't want to be a gazillionaire? But sometimes it's the biggest curse, a curse by our own hand.

We've discovered that while the exchange of goods and services is the reality of money, the all-consuming worship of it becomes a ginormous harmful delusion. Money can buy food, shelter, and comfort. It can also buy toys, opulence, and grandeur. The _actual_ necessities and _supposed_ necessities are where the gobbledygook begins, that's where money can start to own us instead of us owning it.

This isn't a hard concept. WE GET IT! Yet, it seems to elude many humans. How do you like them comets?

When certain earthlings have so little and will do anything to get more, they often commit all kinds of atrocities against others. But here's the thing, even some of those who have more than plenty, WAY MORE, do the same to get MORE. So, for the many, it's not necessarily about more money anymore. It's about POWER. More power! Since the wealthy hardly need anybody because they are able to buy just about anything, they may not understand the gift of sharing, of needing each other, of serving another human being. Wealth can insulate you from the feelings and experiences of those less fortunate—turn you into a superiority monster with a superiority disorder.

Now, arrogance is nothing to admire, right?! Can we agree on that?

So what do you think of worshipping things and accumulating things for superiority power trips?

Things, when they control human beings, can keep them from what's important. Things such as toys, wealth, and objects can turn into all-consuming desires. Then they start admiring wealth for wealth's sake and status. They start thinking in terms of what other humans _have_ and not _who they are_.

The culture of the rich.

A wealth-spell! A wealth-brainwash!

The true value of human beings becomes totally messed up! When value becomes about money, toys, and status, the Godly value is lost. ICK!

How do you like them comets?

Consider this: status, class, and the right bloodlines are all concepts created by silly humans—not by a merciful Creator. As if an all-benevolent creator would put earthlings on different superiority levels on the humanity scale and watch them fight it out gladiator style.

What gobbledygook!

Some wealthy people create such an illusion of good that even they believe in their own delusion. They can be so intoxicated by their own power that they are blind to the danger, even to themselves, of an ill planet obsessed with not sharing power. They believe their employees owe them complete gratitude since they have given them a way to earn a living. Never mind that due to often vicious business practices, an unbalance of epic proportions occurs. Bitter employees may constantly quit and the business is always in turmoil.

How do these greedy employers justify their abuse for employees? All is fair in love, war, and business. When they arrive at their big, beautiful house or ride in their expensive vehicle, they think very little of the people under them who help them acquire their luxurious lifestyle. If they'd share more then there would be a cycle of positivity and prosperity. More humans would have money to buy the very products they help create, but to many of the rich, this would be giving up power in order to share it with the undeserving masses. _Zero-sum game_. _'Only one winner'_ gobbledygook.

" _If I win, they've got to lose."_

Yep, even when it would be to their benefit to share power, they'd rather greedily cling onto it with their superiority games. Superiority status quo.

I keep telling you how superiority is the name of the game on Earth. I hope you've started to believe me.

==================================================

So very many,

silly, silly human beings.

The superiority games they play.

Falling for a wealth-spell,

so deliberately cast on them.

Falling for the cult-ure of the rich,

a cult,

so deliberately brainwashing them to go against their own self interests.

Oh, such superiority games earthlings play.

' _If you win, I lose. I can't share power.'_

' _Power is to be taken and not shared.'_

' _Eat or be eaten.'_

What gobbledygook!

What superiority disorders!

Oh, silly, silly earthlings.

Defining success in such superficial terms.

Using wealth and the wealthy,

to wealth-splain,

to define their worth and other people's worth on Earth. VALUE.

Allowing themselves to be manipulated to blame OTHERS.

Siding with earthly power based on greed,

instead of godly power based on love.

Silly, silly human beings indeed.

### Chapter 14

Brainwash

Now do you see how it's all about the BRAINWASH with so many of these humans? Secret thoughts they don't have to face within themselves where evil can hide and permeate. Brainwash. That's what their delusions do to them. Some of their major superiority delusions:

PHYSICAL BEAUTY—brainwash.

Skin color/eye color— superiority games.

Size, shape, form—superiority games.

Did our Creator tell us what to look like? Who's telling us what our appearance should be? What superiority games are being played? Who's making money out of these insecurities? Who's benefitting?

CONDITIONAL HAPPINESS—brainwash

Happiness in the superiority of wealth—superiority games.

Happiness in the status of things./toys—superiority games.

Quality is one thing and s _uperiority thinking_ is another. Happiness is intertwined with wealth and all the gobbledygook it entails for so very many humans when happiness is largely a choice rather than a value. A choice to be happy in changing what you value instead of superficial happiness in superficial values. In other words—not true happiness at all. So what to value?

CERTAIN VALUES—brainwash.

Stuff value—superiority games.

Cost value—superiority games.

Prestige value—superiority games.

Bloodline value—superiority games.

Name value—superiority games.

Human being value—superiority games.

So again—what to value? Hint—if you can't take it with you then maybe it's not so very valuable. If it's not helping you become a better person in front of our Creator, maybe it's not so valuable.

MATERIAL SUCCESS—brainwash

Wealth games—superiority games.

Worshipping wealth and the wealthy—superiority games.

Admiration of the superficial—superiority games.

The worship of _acting_ important instead of being important—superiority games.

Actually being important equals happiness. Actual Self-actualization and self-fulfillment always from being a **better** _being_ and not from superiority. The Altruism of bettering the existence.

GENDER SUPERIORITY—brainwash

Inequality of genders—superiority games.

An unbalance in power sharing of epic proportions—superiority games.

Balances on Earth completely disrupted—superiority games.

Zero-sum game: " _your superiority makes me inferior so my superiority makes you inferior. I lead. I decide. I'm a gladiator. My gender is meant to dominate_ _._ _"_

NO BIGOTRY—brainwash

Inequality of earthlings—superiority games.

Of course seeds of bigotry are in every universe _being_. Every!—superiority games.

Every _being_ is born in own corner and sees from that space!—superiority games.

Safety within sameness—superiority games.

_Tyranny of the sameness_ —superiority games.

It's a matter of realization, learning, and questioning oneself—self-correcting to fight against such superiority games. Against the blossoming of the seeds of bigotry in all its forms. So _them_ versus _us_ should be constantly self-examined—such superiority games. So manipulations to tie our identity to certain things to keep us battling the _them_ to keep our power—such superiority games. Self -correcting to stop being willfully blind to such superiority games.

SUPERIORITY—brainwash

Worshipping of self—superiority games.

Confusing love with worship—superiority games.

You don't need an altar to create a cult. Love is strictly opposed to worship. Love radiates. Worship selfishly stagnates. Hate also radiates. Radiates with a shove, push, and a crash. Worship and hate may become intertwined to confuse with love. Love reaches far beyond itself. Worship thrives on hateful superiority games.

So you see how this superiority brainwash amongst humans, so very prevalent in them, is why I keep telling you not to go to Earth. It's very dangerous there because of it.

These are the silly games certain humans play—the brainwash they believe. Their Identity affixes itself to such gobbledygook of hateful bigotry, obsessive superiority, toxic sexism, false happiness, public opinion manipulation, obsessive conditioning, and etc.

Opinions become facts. Even though opinions should be based on facts and not to be the facts themselves.

==================================================

So very many,

silly, silly human beings.

Oh, the brainwash they don't question,

the facts they don't believe.

the factoids they insist are true.

tying their identities to such nuggets of brainwash,

insisting on not digging deep into their opinions.

Oh, silly, silly earthlings.

Worship is only an illusion of pretend love,

a cult of a phony identity.

Oh, the games people play.

Superiority games.

Oh, the brainwash they allow themselves to believe.

### Chapter 15

Evil

What I'm about to tell you next may sound unbelievable to you. Yep, unfathomable! But I hope that as you've spent time with me, you've grown to understand that I don't do gobbledygook-speak.

Anyway, a good way of comprehending human beings is to apprehend how very little so many of them actually understand evil. And as a result, they reside in what they don't see in themselves. They get so close to evil that they no longer see it.

Blinded by evil!

Human beings don't always have much humanity! Evil permeates so much of them.

Let me explain—let's start with what _we've_ grown to realize about evil:

What's bad and what's good? This is a very critical question many of us in the universe posed to ourselves. We found that through the prism of the _superiority thinking_ within self-preservation usually good is seen as within our own kind, and the bad is within the ones who are different. In other words, the good is what we believe in and the evil is what someone else believes in.

With acute horror, we realized that desperate and devastating acts were considered evil or good depending on which side we were on. What a discovery! We were able to act accordingly with this information and work diligently toward getting along rather than obsessing to out-superior one another.

But many humans refuse to SEE what is poisoning them! What's damaging them. What's killing them!—so stuck in their _tyranny of sameness_ and _superiority thinking_ that permeates their whole sense of self. Their identity so invested in this gobbledygook—doubling down on such deep dumbness!

So many secret activities occur amongst them that they have actually little understanding of what really goes on in the world around them or even inside their very beings. Of how the brainwash of _superiority thinking_ actually affects them. And how evil then thrives.

Let's talk about one of the most evil humans who ever existed—Hitler. I really hate to mention him. If truth be told—his name makes my green skin crawl! He exterminated millions! SUPERIORITY THINKING big-time! I have no doubt that given the chance—he would've annihilated me too and those like me.

Why did humans fall for his garbage? For his hate? For his evil? If humans asked those questions, they'd get to a lot of truth within themselves. But they don't. They compartmentalize his evil therefore cursing themselves to repeating such horror over and over again.

What blind fools they can be! Blind fools following blind guides!

Evil is neatly placed in a box and set aside as if it has nothing to do with the rest of humanity, as if this horror it creates is a onetime happening. That way humans don't need to face the evil in themselves. Because of this, the many faces of evil can be unrecognizable to them. The serial killer, pedophile, bought and paid for politician, or corrupt instigator is often not recognized.

But he looked so nice. But he was so helpful. But he was one of the most faithful churchgoers. How can he be bad?

Unless those committing evil are vomiting green fluid and have horns and a tail, certain human beings have problems in detecting everyday evil. _See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil._

Recognize no evil!

Exploding stars!—Hitler wasn't the only one to exterminate human beings. Not the only one by a long shot! Remember that next time you insist on having me arrange a trip to Earth and getting you in a human being get-up. Earth suffocates and chokes on devastating events caused by earthlings over and over again.

They just don't learn their lessons!

Exploding stars!

Most humanity has blood on its hands when it comes to destroying one another through intolerance and prejudice. Earth history proves it. These are only a few: Invasions (too many to name individually), land grabs, the inquisition, the crusades, the witch trials, genocide—the murder of whole groups of people is unfortunately endless (the extermination of indigenous peoples, the holocaust, Rwanda, Darfur only to name a very few), and nuclear warfare. The list is never ending.

Their countries, their cultures, and their histories are full of acts of murder to those who wouldn't acquiesce to certain ways, including ways of using a benevolent creator, for killing sprees. Even now much is going on around them.

You should see their superiority games right at this precise moment!

You should see how they buy into manipulation games of _othering_ so they get to keep their identity wrapped in superiority. You should see their hateful words, their evil acts, their justifications, their lies, their truth twists.

Truth twists to square evil in their own minds! To okay it within themselves! To give their own selves cover. That way they don't have to admit to their own enabling of evil! Their own conspiracy with evil. Then evil convinces them it's good. Then evil convinces them it's right to use good against itself. Then evil convinces them not to feel shame.

How do you like them comets?

You should see who really benefits from this sin against humanity! Certainly not God. Not Jesus. Not even the majority of them. The few power abusers who throw out the crumbs from their tables and let humanity fight it out in a blame game of twisted logic—that's who!

What earthlings don't seem to want to grasp is that Hitler didn't start as the Hitler we know today. He snowballed into HITLER. His growth of power was about the blame game. _"It's someone else's fault you're not where you should be!"_ Scapegoat! Instill fear. Divide! Instill fear. Demonize. Instill fear. Hit the grievance sweet spot. Instill fear.

Hitler snowball into the horrors of genocide. Genocide normalized. Can you believe it? ICK!— _othering_ and what it can lead to! The horror! Those earthlings so willfully blind!

So stubborn to side with power that they don't see the evil it can produce! The evil it can cause! The evil it can justify!

The negative, like hate, takes more space in the mind because it's heavy. Love is light. Their lives become so full of hate that their cruelty snowballs. Before they even know it, cruelty becomes one of their weapons of choice against the _others_. And ' _love thy neighbor as thyself_ ' is crushed under the hatred.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

so willing to play with Evil's toys—

cruelty, hate, selflessness, self-righteousness, and superiority, of course,

and INSIST vociferously it's good,

and INSIST vociferously not to feel shame about damaging others.

Oh, silly, silly human beings,

so unwilling to learn from the past.

so unwilling to see evil in themselves,

so willing to cover up cruelty in their own minds.

' _See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil'._

RECOGNIZE NO EVIL,

ENABLE EVIL TO GROW AND FLOURISH.

Such silly, silly creatures,

what do they tell themselves,

to excuse evil?

to be so cruel?

to ignore any soul pinches?

Chapter 16

Good Guys vs. Bad Guys

So many humans are stuck in a good guys versus bad guys playbook. So who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys? Again, to earthlings the good guys are their own kind, and the bad guys are the ones who are different.

You'll hear a common refrain of, _"I'm not bad."_ Or, _"That person isn't bad."_ Or, _"I'm a good person."_ Or, _"That person is good."_

I ask once more, _"Who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys?"_ No one wants to be the bad guys, so humans do bad things while making themselves think they are doing good.

Isn't that remarkable?—to twist yourself in such a knot to make bad into good? To keep your superiority? To keep those _soul pinches_ at bay?

_Soul pinches_ —the Creator trying to tell you something important about yourself.

"I'm not a bad person." **Soul pinch**. _I don't want to be a bad person, so I'll fill myself with fast words and ignore what I don't want to face! Ignore the truth_ — _ignore the soul pinch._

Their histories are revised from what really happened to make one group look like the good one [the good guys], the one who had a reason to murder, the one thought to be _blessed_ with victory, and the other group is the evil one [the bad guys].

Truth is still truth to the universe and there are repercussions that Earth is in the midst of.

We are very well aware that violent energy has to go somewhere unless it's transformed into a positive flow because energy _doesn't_ die.

Energy DOESN'T die.

Don't we know this?

Immoral humans don't recognize evil—can't see themselves even in front of mirrors. They are blinded by their own reflection. Even if someone called them on the evil they've perpetrated, they'd change the history of how events happened, they'd change the reasons behind actions, and they'd change ideas of right and wrong (making the wrong into right). Muddy the waters. Obfuscate. Deny. Change the subject. Insist right is wrong and wrong is right. All because they want to be right in their wrong instead of righting a wrong. They'd make themselves into the heroes of the piece, so they don't face their own villain reflection.

Evil would actually become indistinguishable from good. Acts of evil may be complicated, but the nature of evil is pretty simple: selfishness. The more selfish, the more acts of evil. The deeper humans live inside the thick walls of the shell our Creator put them in, the less they empathize with others and the more everything is about their narcissistic selves— _their_ culture, _their_ beliefs, _their_ acts are only about them. _Their_ world is only a few centimeters around them. So very tiny in their _'good guy'_ enclave.

And everyone else is an _other_. In fact, an evil _other_ according to many of them. The bad guys. Exploding stars!

What a mindset! MINDSET! _Setting_ of the mind! Stuck ideas.

Humanity is made up of so many facets that a good side in another earthling may be viewed without seeing other sides of pure selfishness or without seeing those other parts as deeds of evil. That's why when earthlings define evil as an absolute, as if evil can only exist at 100% in a person, games of evil being committed every day are super ignored such as superiority power games that manipulate others and in turn completely tear others apart and sweep money into the pockets of those swallowing greedily what they can.

The belief that evil is not human and that it sticks out like a sore thumb hides the horrors of pure selfishness. It doesn't deal with how the reality of evil really works! It's often hard to detect bits and pieces that build and snowball instead of obvious monster-like chunks. Again, look at Hitler. Didn't he and his enablers and brainwashed masses think they were the good guys? And that anything and everything could be justified if doing it to the so-called 'bad guys'? That ends justified the means.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

so blinded by true evil,

so willing to brainwash themselves into thinking bad is actually good,

so willing to commit acts of evil against others,

while convincing themselves they are the 'good guys'.

Silly, silly earthlings,

understanding so very little of a parent Creator loving His children,

creating rules for them to get a long,

and not to play superiority games against one another.

Such silly nonsensical creatures,

so obsessed with being right in their wrong,

instead of righting the wrong.

Oh, the games people play.

Oh, the brainwash they believe.

### Chapter 17

Assumed Truths

_Beings_ in the universe have such an abundance of thoughts and ideas floating all over the place. The problem is not putting them in their proper perspective. The predicament is in confusing them with truth.

_Assumed truths_ are not necessarily truths at all. They are ideas assumed to be the truth. Assumptions asserted to be facts. And those assumptions may stem from stereotypes, mob mentality, or _superiority thinking_. FROM INHERENT BIAS. In other words they may come from a whole bunch of gobbledygook!

Since _assumed truths_ often lack any type of self-reflection, they're taken as TRUTH.

Humans are particularly adept at this game which is why their world is so problematic. Which is why they have such problems reaching freedom deep inside of themselves. They are SLAVES to the ton of brainwash I've already discussed. Then the brainwash is only a hop and a skip away to those nasty _assumed truths_ we've worked so hard to recognize and dissect. It takes much critical thinking which many earthlings refuse to engage in.

They'd rather live in their _assumed truths_!

They'd rather stay in hate in their _assumed truths_!

They'd rather dig themselves deep in their _assumed truths_!

How do you like the comets? Ugh!

Because of _soul pinches_ , Earthlings find a need to stay in the _good guy_ column so _assumed truths_ also become a necessity to them. This way they can drown out those barbs of conscience by yelling out assumptions thought to be true by them.

They may have seen one person of a particular group doing something and then paint everyone in that group with that same broad brush.

ASSUMED TRUTH.

They may have been taught the same belief all of their lives so in their minds, "How can it not be the truth?"

ASSUMED TRUTH.

They may be part of a whole group of people who got stuck in the stubbornness of mob mentality. "How can it not be the truth with so many of us believing the same thing?" Think Jesus' crucifixion with a horde chanting their condemnation of a man they were brainwashed with lies to hate.

ASSUMED TRUTH.

Othering.

ASSUMED TRUTH.

Physical beauty.

ASSUMED TRUTH.

Then assumed truths become assumed reality which is not reality at all. It is a façade of toxic _wants/desires_ instead of a goodness reality of flowing empathy.

ASSUMED TRUTH

All stars in the sky are alive since they are sparkling.

See what I mean about being a slave to such gobbledygook? Forget FREEDOM in such instances.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

and their assumed truths.

Believing so fully in assumptions as facts,

in order to keep their identity superiority.

Silly, silly earthlings,

pounding assumed truths,

into assumed reality,

into toxic non-reality lives,

into the poison of evil.

Oh, such silly creatures,

not recognizing the brainwash before them,

the manipulation of their thoughts,

the slaves they become,

and the destruction to their world it all causes.

Oh, the superiority games earthlings play,.

giving up their inner freedom,

to be slaves to superiority,

to be slaves to assumed truths.

### Chapter 18

Who?

Here's a riddle for you:

Who was born in poverty and in a stable because there was no room at the inn? Who had to escape persecution in his land as a baby with his parents because a puppet king of the Romans ordered a massacre? Who had to escape a weak, vicious, power hungry abuser terrified of a power shift? Who became a REFUGEE in Egypt to escape such horror?

Who only came back to his country when the evil narcissistic puppet king died? Who was only a child when he amazed others with his grasp of the scriptures? Who went to his cousin in a show of humility and solidarity to be baptized? Who went into the desert for forty days and forty nights to pray and think? During this time, who did NOT compromise with evil even while hungry? Who wouldn't compromise for power? For glory? For worship? No compromise of the lesser of two evils for him.

Who gathered his diverse disciples from different walks in life? Different backgrounds. Who was severely criticized by religious leadership for picking a hated tax collector as a disciple?

Who was accused of being a foreigner as if it's such a bad word? Who was horribly demonized for not following status quo?—anything to delegitimize this preacher full of hopeful messages instead of their message of fear. Who was severely criticized for associating with the sinners instead of hanging out in superiority circles?

Who preached mercy and didn't want sacrifices? Who demanded that children be well cared for? Who upturned the money changers' tables because they made the Temple into a 'den of robbers'? Who was it that said, 'you can't serve two masters—God or money' and insisted that it was very hard for a rich man to get into heaven?—which surprised his disciples that a wealthy person didn't automatically make it to heaven. Who saved an adulteress from death in the middle of toxic masculinity? It wasn't the adulterer on trial, right?

Who performed miracles, healed the sick, and cared deeply for other human beings? Who fed a crowd by, instead of magically appearing food, making a few loaves of bread and fish collected from the crowd be enough for everyone? A grand lesson in sharing. Who gave his most famous address, the Sermon on the Mount, about being blessed through humility, mercy, and purity of heart? Blessed are those who mourn, who are peacemakers, and who strive for justice. Who taught lessons about treating others as you would have them treat you, love thy neighbor as thyself, and cast the first stone?

Who taught in parables, clear messages, and relatable words full of hope, love, and forgiveness instead of fire and brimstone? Who was blasted for healing on the Sabbath of which he declared that 'the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath'? Also, when ' _Moses gave us only the Law with its rigid demands and merciless justice',_ who' _brought us loving forgiveness as well'?_ (John 1:17) The Pharisees—More criticizing, criticizing, criticizing of him. More delegitimizing, delegitimizing, delegitimizing.

Who washed his disciples' feet to show them and other followers what it would take to be Godly? Who lost his temper at the hypocrites, blind fools, blind guides, sons of vipers—not giving them a free pass with turn the other cheek? Not them! No, not these Pharisees. These Phari-blind who were too blind to see their sins against humanity as they lost the very essence of God in their constant quest for staying in power—they lost their humanity. They did what the son of man REFUSED to do—making a deal with evil supposedly to combat evil, to stay in power. To get in agreement with the father of liars. All to stay in power.

Who called out the hypocrites for making mountains out of molehills while making their own mountains into molehills? _'"Don't criticize, and then you won't be criticized. For others will treat you as you treat them. And why worry about a speck in the eye of a brother when you have a board in your own.'"(Matthew 7:1-3)_

Who was set up by one of his disciples for money? The Judas kiss. Who was at the Garden of Gethsemane, crying tears of blood and fervently praying, as his disciples kept falling asleep? FALLING ASLEEP. Who was arrested for basically disrupting the power structure of power hungry abusers? Who healed the severed ear of a high priest's servant when one of his disciples turned to violence? Who said, _'He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword'?_

' **He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword.'**

Who was put on trial with propaganda and lies, but was accused of those very same things in an epic case of projection? PROJECTION—it was this religious leadership of members who were experts at propaganda, lies, and the twisting people's weak minds around their agenda. Who had arrived just a few days earlier to Jerusalem to tremendous greetings and praises, but within days some of those very same people were out for his blood? Within days!—not long at all for people's minds to be manipulated, even though, the same earthlings had seen his miracles and listened to his messages of hope. Yes, people who buried their morals—they buried all the goodness of God within moments! They allowed themselves to be twisted in knots to fear that this man was the enemy out to destroy what they knew and cared about. FEAR. Fear of a loss of identity within status quo. Fear that transforms into anger. Rage.

When Pilate asked the frenzied mob who to pick to set free—an infamous murderer or this man—they picked the criminal with much blood on his hands. They chanted, "Crucify! Crucify." **CHANTED** their brainwash. And when Pilate demanded to know what had his man done wrong, they and their manipulated minds couldn't give specifics. They kept yelling, "Crucify,'' and even said that _this man's blood be on them and also on their children_! That's how right they thought they were in their ASSUMED TRUTHS.

And lastly, who was crucified for daring to question authority—a radical who wouldn't, under any circumstances, partner with an evil against mercy and humanity?! Who resurrected within three days, but before he ascended to heaven, he told his disciples to spread his message? Spread healing, mercy, and love—the Creator's calling card.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

allowing themselves to be manipulated,

into murdering a Savior.

Oh, silly, silly creatures,

cursing themselves and their progeny,

instead of waking up.

WAKE UP!—silly earthlings!

Chapter 19

The Minimizing Jesus Superiority Game

Here's another puzzle:

What does positive maleness look like and a perfect balance of power? The answer is the same as the previous riddle. You already know the answer, don't you?! Of course you do. Because I'm certain you know of him. Who?

Jesus, of course. The incredible Jesus of Nazareth. Let's expand on his life, shall we?

He's the main reason so many of you insist on going to Earth. To go to his human birthplace. Mindboggling, isn't it?—how so many humans don't understand the importance of the Creator choosing that backwards planet for Jesus' visit. The enormity of it? My humble guess is that God was trying to get humans to realize that they need to do better. To become better _beings_ and cut out their superiority games.

That's what I think. What do you think?

Unfortunately, so many humans, even those who insist they follow Jesus, make him so small. Small so that they can keep going with their _superiority thinking_. Their toxic testosterone power. They'll never admit to it, but it's exactly what happens on that silly planet.

Let me just explain it as best as I can about Jesus' teachings and how so many humans go so terribly wrong. It's actually not difficult to understand, but it's a hard concept for those humans who refuse to divorce themselves from their superiority complexes. By the way, superiority complexes are the very same as inferiority complexes. Just think about it for a minute. Both are actually based, at their very core, on fear of not being good enough. Not being powerful enough.

_BUT_ Jesus showed us the way. He gave us his blood—his life. He showed us what priorities to have. He cleared our path full of superiority gobbledygook. He SHOWED us the way.

But that's the old Jesus. Apparently there's a new one for many earthlings. In this version of him what the gospels say he was strongly about is completely minimized. Majorly minimized. They can't get rid of his teachings altogether but they can sure diminish him.

They can twist his message into a pretzel so twisted, it's distorted. Make him out to be part of their power games.

I really don't know why earthlings don't stop minimizing Jesus as they cast the first stone, and why they can't help one another? Go beyond their hypocrisy of maximizing any tiny imperfection in their so-called adversaries while ignoring the mountains of ugliness on their side. See the whole picture—in color and with all the subtleties. Superiority doesn't think it has anything to learn. Humility does. Empathize as Jesus has shown them in his teachings. In the Sermon on the Mount.

Stop lying in generalities and see the honesty in specifics.

I just don't understand how with everything Jesus showed us, many humans make Jesus a judgmental Christ who only came to Earth to take a measuring stick to so-called enemies. He is but a callous Jesus who doesn't care about the whole ramifications of actions—seeing only the superficial in generalities and ignoring the truth in specifics. He is but a spoiled child of God with a gladiator mentality seeking glory at the cost of suffering and desperation.

A Bizarro Jesus.

I'm absolutely certain that Jesus is not _that_ Savior, unrecognizable to anyone who knows the Gospels. Silly humans that savage his heart with self-righteous excuses, rabid hate, and _superiority thinking._ Do I really need to say this—they need to stop crucifying Jesus over and over again.

But so many of them have made minimizing Jesus' whole message an art form. That is, unless it's about them. Cast the first stone unless it's happening to me. Excuse horrible behavior of those I deem valuable but not those I don't. Excuse it for those in my circle the _good_ guys and not the _others_ —the _bad_ guys.

But what it comes down to for many of these humans is:

What do they care? It's not happening to them.

Of which I've got to say to them:

If horrible acts committed to somebody else don't bother you enough to put your own self-interests aside, you need to check on who you are as a human being. Seriously, GO to the doctor—you may no longer have a heartbeat.

Of course, these earthlings would never admit to such feelings—it would make them _bad people_. So they keep it in their secret thoughts. Secret poison that seeps into everyday lives through brutal actions.

And furthermore they ignore Jesus until he's turned into a gladiator Jesus worshipping the wealthy, demanding servants, and sharpening his superiority. A Jesus who is opposite of the one in the Gospels.

Again, a Bizarro Jesus.

A phony Jesus in cahoots with Evil. An evil that makes obsessions with power just fine. An evil that often uses ugly words towards others because if it can make them feel bad, they are under its power.

With this unholy alliance, humans insist on obsessing over _their_ litmus test guidelines—keeping them and judging others by them. Exploding stars! Can you believe that there are certain beliefs Jesus didn't even mention, but silly earthlings often use them to judge and invalidate one another and to justify evil acts of hate and ugliness towards each other? How do you like them comets?

I mean, if you know you've only got a certain time on the planet, as Jesus did, wouldn't you say what's most important? Exploding stars! That's only logical.

Don't they know that if they keep Jesus' heart, they'll naturally do all that he wanted from them? This way love naturally flows from deep inside them. Self-awareness takes hold. Awareness of the complexity of human beings—far away from simplistic, one-dimensional terms. Appreciation of others instead of intolerance.

Appreciation and not mere tolerance.

Why in the universe, why in their toxic world, are they following a Bizarro Jesus and committing the same gobbledygook over and over? In retrospect, maybe we should thank earthlings for what we've learned from their horrible behavior. In seeing what they do to one another, we knew we had to do much better.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

so willing to shrink Jesus,

or push him way down in some corner so their soul pinches can be ignored.

Silly, silly humans,

minimizing Jesus,

so they can listen to their superiority games much better instead of Jesus' voice.

Now they can be modern-day Pharisees,

not caring if they fail the Jesus test,

or the God test for that matter,

prioritizing what Jesus told them precisely not to do,

prioritizing the power within the rules,

instead of the rules for the caring of humanity,

humanity,

humane,

better—not superior.

Silly, silly creatures

not thinking that they can be at God's doorstep,

about to face a creator wanting spiritual answers and not man-made ones—

what good did they take to God?

what bad did they leave behind?

Oh silly, silly, human beings,

insisting on what they want to believe,

insisting on their brainwash instead of questioning it.

Crucifying Jesus repeatedly with no actual facts or truth—just substitute ones.

Phony ones.

And this is how the Bizarro Jesus, the anti-Jesus, emerges,

And rules.

An apocalypse.

### Chapter 20

Self-correcting/the Morality Test

Failing the God test. Failing the Jesus test. We, _beings_ of the universe, had to think very seriously what these tests meant in order to self-correct.

Stopping at a red light is an action for our own protection and for the protection of others too. Yes, there are red lights, green lights, and yellow lights throughout the universe—conducting our movement. Making us safe. When we stop not only because it can hurt us, but we consider how it can hurt others, then we begin to know morality. To know God. To know Jesus.

But meekness and humility speak softly in worlds that are constantly shrieking and trying to demand all of the Creator's attention like a newborn child wanting instant gratification. Meekness and humility serve instead of take. We realized that if we don't know how to serve other _beings_ , their families, and the Creator's energy, then we live in our own _self-entitled disconnected kingdoms._ While there, we'll need all kinds of hallucinogens like alcohol, drugs, vanity and the like to keep our delusions of superiority in place, where we can keep deluding ourselves with what we think makes us happy instead of becoming better _beings_.

Better _beings_ —that's the actual way to happiness.

We asked ourselves why we made God a brutal taskmaster? —who sat on a throne, waiting to punish. Why did we make Him a magician? —appearing and disappearing things from supposedly nothing. We're in a partnership with Him, part of all creation, so there has to be free will and not a dictatorship. Not an abuse of power—of force.

We absolutely stopped creating God in our image! This heinous act of projection used to make me sooo crazy! The Creator is in all the energy inside and all around us. This is why all acts have repercussions. Energy never dies. Energy is transformed. It is all a flow—moving and fluid. Think in cycles, in circles, in cylinders—the boomerang affect.

Tiny moments make up our lives that connect like dots from one _being_ to another. What we say or do affects more than we can possibly imagine. The ripple effect. We live in a constant chain of events. We did this, then that happened, causing these events, getting those results, then that occurred and so on and on.

Being careful about what we pray for is critical because answered prayers don't come in neat boxes. They come within cycles and patterns affecting not only us individually but those around is. That's why rules are necessary to help contain and organize this commotion.

Be careful what you pray for...

It takes much soul searching to understand that the rules and messages that teachers such as Jesus brought to us are for US. They are not for God's vanity. They are so all of us can coexist without taking advantage of each other, hating one another, or being abusive and demeaning. They are so we can reach our highest illumination, be at peace, be at love. And because God is a parent, our happiness is His happiness, our peace is His peace, and our war is unfortunately His war.

The thing about humans is that they can get so stuck on self-preserving that when they mention their supposed love for the Creator, they make God (a loving and concerned creator), look harmful and vicious. They make him into a harsh, unforgiving, arrogant, and vain dictator. A power hungry abuser. Ugh! And they often make themselves in _that_ image.

Exploding stars!

It's no wonder why so many of them have brainwashed themselves to throw away free will and demand a controlling state! A government that forces its citizens into their notion of this dictator God! —when it's all actually about power. About _superiority thinking_! Not about a Creator who wants His creation to have free will.

How do you like them comets?

They can squabble over the most inconsequential things like over what to call God or who has the most history with Him or who He loves best. Exploding stars!—we're all part of creation!

God has sent earthlings evolved teachers to help them, but these special _beings_ have been mischaracterized, their words twisted and changed, and horribly murdered. Rigid ideas and rules have kept out what should've always been in the fold:

Love and compassion. One just has to look at Jesus to see how God works.

He most certainly didn't want to start a cult of himself or a culture of religion.

Jesus shook the status quo. He threw out the moneymakers from God's sanctuary, he shared bread and himself with those thought to be the undeserving, he prevented fatal rocks from being hurled, and he enlightened anyone who would listen, mainly about the far reaches of love, healing, hope, and interconnections instead of focusing on the condemnations.

He showed earthlings the peaceful ways of getting along and the warrior ways to combat what is destructive. Balances. But what so many humans mainly focus on are these warrior ways and making them fit into delusions of grandeur so that they're against each other instead of being against what is destructive.

I'm superior to you, my ideas are superior to yours, and my God is superior to yours.

There are so many earthlings who want to desperately believe that they and theirs are more special to God than others. Godly energy spills lovingly through and to all of them.

The Creator's love isn't a competition. It's not about who He loves better because He loves all. Isn't that the mark of a good parent?

So let me make this clear—just because material toys are overflowing, doesn't mean they are the Creator's blessings. Just because you've got your cover charities in place, doesn't mean God thinks you're sufficiently merciful. Just because you insist you're a good guy, doesn't mean Jesus thinks you are.

And just because a thunderclap doesn't strike you, doesn't mean the Creator is happy with you.

To command pawns in a giant chess game of human lives trying to survive makes no sense to the Creator's ways. Manipulating power at all costs. God doesn't even do that, and his energy force is all powerful. So much attention is put on power and those delusions that make up power.

There's no reason to have so many self-esteem issues when we're such a miraculous creation—all of us.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

failing the God test of love so miserably,

actually siding with God for His power,

but lying to themselves about it.

Oh silly, silly earthlings,

failing the Jesus test so miserably,

lacking in so much empathy,

and so very, very cruel.

Oh silly, silly humans,

failing the morality test so miserably,

as they excuse all kinds of evil perpetrated on others,

as they twist themselves into pretzels to okay it.

Oh, the games people play.

Oh, the brainwash they insist on believing.

### Chapter 21

Self-correcting/The Case for Diversity

One HUGE realization we made was that we don't have to be all the same to be loved and necessary to our Creator. Differences don't make us any less of a family—a universe family. We're different for a reason!

It was an earthling who said this critical phrase—"Absolute power corrupts absolutely."

Absolute sameness is absolute power! This prevents different views and ideas from being shared. _Tyranny of the sameness_! The absolute rigidity of self-righteousness and inflexibility blinds from the multi-dimensionality of life. Blind beyond our sights! And all of us have blind spots. Of course we do. We're born in a certain situation and only see from that viewpoint. A limited viewpoint at best.

We figured out what OTHERS could teach us? Even those without much wealth and/or with limited technology. As if so-called progress is of only value in a civilization. Material progress. When you gain something you always lose something—leave something behind. We've come to comprehend that every _being_ knows something we don't. Something. We now know that there was a tremendous problem in not valuing each of our different contributions because of the brainwash in only valuing certain things. Things that have to do with wealth. _Superiority thinking!_ Then some lives became more superficially valuable than others. Materialistically valuable. What a travesty!

If we've got a problem, chances are that someone in the universe full of billions upon billions of souls will have a solution for it. The Creator built us to depend on one another. All of us need each other.

We started including all _beings_ in an US instead of in a THEM category, and our empathy, compassion, and understanding opened up. Then we had common ground for communication and learning purposes. It was a starting point to understanding and respecting differences.

Respecting others.

Respecting our Creator's family that all of us are gloriously a part of.

And the way we choose to run our worlds is up to us. Our free will.

We ultimately run our worlds and they in turn run us back. We may use power and money to run them, but they're basically in our hands. Money may exchange hands for a job to be done but it exchanges hands. Money can't run itself. _Beings_ and not objects are the ones who actually get the work done or find a way of getting it done. So we need **A** to happen here in order for **B** to happen there. Someone has to hand-pick the food from nature here for us to eat it there.

We absolutely need each other. We need to take care of each other. We need to value ALL contributions instead of placing value with a superiority brainwash measuring stick. Be aware and grateful of all acts contributing to our day to day moments. Awareness of all pieces of the puzzle beyond the lies and damage of superiority games. I can't emphasize this enough.

Again, stopping at a red light is an action for our own protection and for the protection of others too. When we stop not only because it can hurt us, but we consider how not halting can hurt others, then we begin to know God. We now understand that! But humans...eeek!

Exploding stars!

They play such power games leading to phony happiness.

The happiness that humans may feel by putting themselves on a higher plane than _others_ is not true happiness—it's an illusion of happiness having nothing to do with the peace a _being_ needs inside for true contentment and fulfillment. They don't have to let others' delusions tell them who they are, make them big or small, take away their birthright that is greatness in a true sense.

A celebration of diversity can teach them to be truly content.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

not capitalizing on the strength of diversity,

but instead drowning in the brainwash of the greedy power abusers,

not recognizing that diversity tears away at blind spots,

tyranny of the sameness,

hatred games.

It shines the light on the specific and forces generalities to explain themselves.

It leads to true happiness.

Oh silly, silly creatures,

Giving up happiness for superiority.

### Chapter 22

Self-correcting/The 3 P's

So where does all this hate-along stupidity start anyway? Where evil is allowed to permeate, of course! As you well know we _beings_ of the universe had to study this and address it fervently.

After fighting all kinds of massive wars, nearly abolishing ourselves and the whole universe as we know it, we finally got it together for a solution. This solution included taking a good look at ourselves in the mirror without flinching and looking away. It took into account everybody's opinion. EVERYBODY! And not just those who were wealthy, but those on the margins too. Those whose planets were deemed inconsequential in our toxic superiority wars.

But here's the thing, we were very careful about true leadership. We were careful about the type of leadership that does the bidding of evil by manipulating crowds—think about the tricky shenanigans that got Jesus tried and crucified. True leadership that inspires and leads to betterment and not superiority. Jesus' type of leadership and not the Bizarro one's kind.

But to have gotten there we needed to understand what got us into the messes. So we studied, discussed, and came to some important conclusions.

We woke up from our superiority games. We quit our 3 P's of puffery, pretend, and poppycock! We finally realized destruction in order to keep our identity of puffery was putrid. Pining to be number one while causing others pain is putrid indeed in its puffery of a _zero-sum_ _game._ Praying to a Creator, the greatest of parents, while being co-conspirators or complicit to awful acts against one another was pretend worship at best. Pretend Godliness. Pretend piety. Pretend Jesus follower—following him only on the surface. Filling ourselves with all kinds of poppycock for cover because no one wants to be evil. None of us wanted to be a bad _being_ , so we made evil okay by calling it good.

Thank goodness, we woke up from such a pretentious sham! We realized the importance of compromise instead of on doubling down on the deep dumbness that compromise is for patent losers. We woke up from all the lying we did in our own heads about the other side refusing to compromise when it was us who insisted others meet us halfway on our own road instead of meeting in the middle.

Thank goodness we woke up from our deeply limited thinking of staying locked in our puffery, pretend, and poppycock in order to stay in our prison identity of _superiority thinking._ Woke up from: The rich kept getting richer as the majority kept getting poorer, but in order to keep worshipping the rich and therefore siding with them, siding with that kind of silly non-Godly power, we scapegoated others for our own predicament. Then as certain greedy _beings_ of the rich destroyed governments, ideas, and the environment to get richer, we willfully blinded ourselves to what was happening.

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

Recognize no evil.

Cover up for evil.

Exploding stars! What silly, silly greedy _beings_ not understanding that their avarice would be like a heated boomerang coming back to konk them on the head! But in their _self-entitled kingdoms_ , they assumed their wealth would insulate them from anything!

Assumed truth.

Silly power trips that don't take into account what happens to everybody when the fabric of society is destroyed. Everybody!

Some of our elderly, instead of getting wiser, stuck to their ideas, their limited thinking, and the dinosaurs with stale ideas of silly _superiority thinking_ ruled our worlds all the while destroying the future of _beings_.

We woke up indeed.

And worked for wisdom instead of _assumed truths_.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

so many of them deeply asleep in their puffery, pretend, and poppycock.

Such superiority games!

Such wealth games!

Power games that can bring down whole societies,

where money changes value,

and the rich are longer the rich.

Oh silly, silly earthlings,

often siding with certain greedy individuals,

against their very own selves,

instead of making them understand,

the value in sharing prosperity,

the fruitful boomerang of prosperity,

and peace.

But no such luck for these,

silly, silly creatures,

who would rather have the horror boomerang instead.

Such pathetic creatures,

the brainwash they believe,

the identity gobbledygook they uphold

Chapter 23

Mission Statement

We created an organization to help us reach our greater selves—the United Planets of the Universe.

What a brainstorm. I tell you, it was a mega-magnificent idea. Exploding stars! What a way to keep the peace!

Peace!

Power to peace!

I can't stress it enough—the power of peace is about healing, empathy, and love. Strength in peace vs. the destructiveness of war.

### Mission Statement

The mission of the United Planets of the Universe is to work for the rights of all _beings_ in the universe. We will protect, empower, and encourage _beings_ with a peace objective. Implementation will require checking ourselves constantly of arrogance and superiority that go with power games. We are up to the task of self-reflection and self-correction in order to share power instead of taking and abusing it. Power to the peace in the universe.

How do you like them comets?

If only earthlings understood such words, but I'm afraid so many of them are going after the exact opposite.

### =====

So very many,

silly, silly human beings,

not comprehending the power of peace,

obsessed with war games,

tying weakness to peace.

Superiority games as usual with them.

Refusing to look at other sides,

so they just stay staunchly in their own space.

Jesus' frustration with power games—

Blind fools, blind guides, hypocrites, sons of vipers.

How will earthlings survive such foolishness?

### Chapter 24

The Human Race Obituary

If earthlings don't get their act together, their destruction is guaranteed. _And_ I certainly don't want you to be on the planet when those silly creatures self-destruct. I imagine their obituary will go somewhat like this:

The human race, the only (actual) race on a teensy tiny but glorious planet called Earth, destroyed itself after losing the battle for superiority—mind you, not with other planets or other universe _beings_ but with themselves. It was centuries of years old, but unfortunately, a great segment of humans seemed to have learned so very little within so much time. Superiority games kept playing out and those earthlings obsessed with such gobbledygook had the loudest voices—a toxic shriek that could be heard as far away as other planets. This whelp that drowned out the cries, agony, and pleas of the other gender on that planet. This poisonous testosterone overrode the positive kind and defined their world culture henceforth through the ages.

So hate was their path forward or rather their fuel much more than love. Love—a wimpy emotion to so many of them compared to the grandiose power of hate. Unfortunately, they had the actual meaning of greatness reversed, and they united in hate. Bathed in it. Reveled in its destructiveness. Jesus tried to teach them hate's destructive ways—especially with the Sermon on the Mount. He taught them to be humble, be merciful, be kind. Be empathetic. Be aware of the evil enticing God's creation with necessities, glory, and worship. BEWARE.

Jesus cured the sick, preached hope, and taught lessons. Taught tremendous lessons because all _beings_ need to learn so very much in order to better their souls. **But** human beings believed _in_ him while not actually believing him, so _better_ was replaced with _superiority_ even if they wouldn't admit to this very stain on their souls. They wouldn't admit it to themselves much less to other earthlings. Sharing the planet became unthinkable to those with a winner/loser gladiator mentality. A **zero-sum game**.

" _I've gotta win so you gotta lose."_

" _If you're winning, I'm losing since only one can win."_

" _Y_ _ou're_ _taking away so much from me—not the powerful I'm siding with. Not them. Their GREATNESS will rub off on me. You are to blame. I'm your victim."_

And the true victims of _superiority thinking_ were victimized over and over again.

So Jesus predicted an apocalypse. It must've not been so very difficult for him who didn't suffer from myopic sight as a great many humans did, to see how it would turn out for those he so desperately tried to save. Jesus warned of the tragic demise of humans. WARNED but certain humans saw it as a promise instead—a promise to destroy their perceived enemies, a promise to destroy everything and everyone they hated, a promise to double down on their perceived notions of what is right, a promise to prove the superiority of these concepts based on power. It would be a time to take a victory lap for staying firm in their concrete boxes of supposed righteousness and maybe get a pat on the back from God Himself for keeping 'God's warriors' on top of the food chain.

And a whole slew of issues didn't matter to them. A healthy humanity, environment, and future were not a priority to them. Peace didn't matter when much profit was to be made out of war. Peace didn't matter when Jesus _promised_ destruction. Peace didn't matter, period.

Evil didn't matter as long as it was on their side.

So the powerful lied, twisted facts, manipulated minds to keep their own power—alas the story of how humanity kept tripping on the same rock over and over again. And instead of learning from this tragic episode, the misguided ones just blamed the ethnicity of the religious leaders, actually declaring their own ethnic superiority in the process, instead of checking within themselves of what evil may have hide in any corner.

Even when Jesus ranted and raved profusely against the power-hungry leadership, these individuals didn't get a ' _turn the other cheek_ ' free pass—not them, did they take the time to really examine what he was saying. What he was trying these superiority abusers to wake up from. WAKE UP! To get their priorities straight. That even when _beings_ dot all the i's and cross all the t's in religiosity, that's just following God on the surface. Following man-made ideas. So Jesus blew up calling them hypocrites, blind fools, blind guides, and sons of vipers. Absolutely blew up! And those are the same words he would likely use against more modern-day Pharisees of every religion and ethnicity. Yes, blind guides who destroyed Earth to keep their own silly earthly power. I'm certain they didn't get a warm reception from Jesus once they got to the reckoning.

Sarcasm—who would've thought that stoking hate, excusing all kinds of horrors, and destroying the Earth would bother our Creator? A Creator who made humans the protectors of their planet and NOT it's dominators to destroy it in a power/money grab. Protection not domination.

Sarcasm—who would've thought that Jesus didn't really mean what he preached and that he, deep inside, was really about power games and worshiping the rich. He was crucified when he refused to play the status quo games and was lied about but hey, forget that and twist your own mind and believe your own lies about specific facts so you can stay in the generalities of gobbledygook.

Instead, humanity lost its humanity and earthlings played their superiority games to the hilt—until death. They insisted on _assumed truths_ —assumptions that were not truth at all. This led to _assumed reality_ —a dangerous façade of what is supposed to be real but actually isn't reality at all. They manipulated and brainwashed one another through fears. Identity fears especially. One wonders if it was worth it once they actually faced our Creator and had to explain the genocides of His human family. It won't matter how many times they attended church, prayed long prayers, and exalted God if they made Jesus a Bizarro Jesus. A hater Jesus. A superiority Jesus who cancels out mercy, humility, and empathy for self-righteous power. In other words, a Jesus who cancels out who the gospels say he was.

Exploding stars!—earthlings and their gladiator games! Their superiority perches! Their hate poison in disguise of their defense of, _"I'm a good person."_ Their refusal to recognize the myriad of ways _bad_ disguises itself as _good_!

Ugly rhetoric. Twisted logic. Gobbledygook excuses.

Knock, knock—universe inhabitants to any earthlings who may have miraculously survived in destroying each other's voices let me tell you what you lost:

You lost peace. You lost hope. You lost your survival.

You lost it all!

It's no wonder that Earth was so noisy that earthlings had trouble hearing the Creator and getting in tune and in line with that energy. That true power.

So goodbye to the late, could've been exceptional, humanity survived by the very ill planet Earth. We wish it a quick recovery. A quick healing from what humans did to it. To their own home. We are there for you, Earth. Here's hoping your next inhabitants are much better guests.

### Chapter 25

Surviving and Thriving

"... _I'm a failed actress. A failed artist. I'm not much good as a mother...I have failed at everything, Yuri, but I won't fail as a human being." Character of Ava Fontaine in movie_ — _"Lord of War"_

Instead of the awful obituary I sincerely hope humanity turns itself around. I would really love to start recommending Earth for travel. To be able to assert that Earth is a fun destination. But as of now, I can't in good conscience recommend that very problematic planet with its inhabitants so often cruel to one another. So blindly engaged and co-conspirators with evil. Clouding the difference between good and bad so they don't have to face reality. Let me make it clear that I don't believe the gobbledygook that earthlings are bad by nature. They are born with souls aren't they? It's just that so many of them do bad things thinking they're doing good—being brainwashed and manipulated by evil. So, I can't stress it enough that if you travel there, it'll take months, at least, to recover from PTSD.

Instead, please take me up on my many extraordinary packages. Visit places that have learned the value of kindness as related to peace versus the toxic superiority hatred games of war. Yeah, kindness has made so many _beings_ happier in their successful diverse relationships. Being kind translated to becoming _better_ beings. So I strongly suggest you travel to kind planets.

Our universe is truly incredible with all its diversity. Unlike so many humans, we see the value of diversity. And of not merely tolerating it but celebrating it. Learning from one another is a gift—not a burden.

Doing away with self-preservation models of superiority that warp value systems, only improves us as _beings_ of a higher God—an inclusive Creator verses an exclusive one. We are but puzzles with so many pieces and none is too small to be inconsequential. Every star, every comet, every planet, every atom, every single thing in the universe is part of God—so it is of greatness. Appreciating one another brings us so much closer to what our maker intended for us because to better ourselves is to better our souls.

At the end of our lives we complete our part of the Creator's puzzle. The more diversity we shared with one another, the more complete our section of the puzzle. And so therefore, the more whole the picture of the enigma is, the more answers to life we accumulated to better our souls before coming face to face with God. The more limited our part of the puzzle is, the more we have to explain to Him.

**Explain** our refusal to understand that _life is a simple game played by complicated players._ **Explain** that the reason for complicated _beings_ is blindness towards life tips from babies. **Explain** how self-preservation becomes about the _superiority thinking_ that anything not feeding into the importance of a _superiority identity_ is a huge threat. **Explain** these power games falling to the feet of toxic testosterone poisoned in gladiator arrogance. **Explain** our default setting becoming about superiority than about becoming better _beings._

**Explain** how we then become prime targets for all kinds of brainwash of what to look like and what to value. **Explain** worshiping the rich in a wealth-spell and catering to them. **Explain** hating on one another so we can side with the power hungry abusers. **Explain** our denial of bigotry in order not to face it within ourselves. **Explain** our insistence on _the tyranny of the sameness_ so that we absolutely stay in our suffocating comfort level. **Explain** how this leads to absolute power—our boxed-in power that corrupts absolutely. **Explain** the blame game of scapegoating, demonizing, and fearing the _others_ —the Creator's other family members. **Explain** _fear-thinking_ so that there's no need to give others credit for contributions.

**Explain** how Jesus liberated us from all of that gobbledygook but we insist on drinking evil's poison. **Explain** what's hard to understand about Jesus telling us:

Treat others as you would have them treat you.

He wants mercy and not sacrifices.

It's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than a rich person to heaven.

Oh, and don't forget:

Why do you criticize the speck in your brother's eye when you've got a board in your own?

**Explain** the act of minimizing Jesus in order to keep the superiority games—keep the _zero-sum_ gobbledygook where it's prohibited that all of us can win _—'_ _you've got to lose so that I win'_. **Explain** turning Jesus into a Bizarro Savior devoid of his positive masculinity from the Gospels.

**Explain** siding with those blind fools, blind guides, hypocrites, and sons of serpents for a blame game in place of empathy, love, and understanding. **Explain** defending this siding with evil, becoming evil's toys, by jumping thoughts like frogs from one lily pad to another in order to stay in generalities and away from the honesty in specifics. **Explain** falling for the selfishness of evil. **Explain** siding with evil against evil—it makes no sense. **Explain** using the **'** _I'm not a bad person'_ defense to cover for evil. **Explain** allowing evil to snowball in willful ignorance and complicity.

**Explain** membership in country club religions based on _self-entitled disconnected kingdoms_. **Explain** the culture of religion instead of the culture of the Creator of everything big and small. **Explain** the lack of shame in damaging others in God's family. **Explain** ignoring _soul pinches_ in order not to delve into secret thoughts of _assumed_ _truths_. **Explain** about not fighting _assumed truths_ becoming _assumed reality_ —assumed ideas of convenience becoming a façade of reality.

**Explain** the awful blindness in the lack of self-reflection and self-correction.

**Explain** why we didn't use our very valuable time to grow instead of out-superior one another.

EXPLAIN.

### Chapter 26

Be Better

So take my advice. Please heed my warnings. Visit positive planets. FORGET Earth. GO to Mex-Space Tacos and take a virtual reality tour instead. Above all, don't be anything like those very silly, silly humans so complicit in their evil of cruelty.

Don't push. Don't shove. Don't abuse. Play fair. Stop trying to out-superior one another. Stop the, ' _It's not happening to me so what do I care_ ,' attitude. _Hey, definitely_ s _top lying to yourself about that not being your attitude._ STOP squaring all kinds of evil in your own minds and calling it good. Instead, respect one another's contributions, be aware of all the superiority brainwash in your secret thoughts, practice the empathy Jesus demanded of us with the golden rule, stand up to evil rather than allowing yourselves to be too wimpy to sufficiently push back. Push back with all your might!—before it uses your good against you and/or snowballs into unspeakable horrors affecting EVERYONE because hate is a poison that swallows ALL. Don't fall for its tricks. Don't allow its ugliness. Don't be fooled.

Don't be a pushover.

So, be the children of the loving Creator. Make His priorities your priorities. Value what He thinks is important instead of wealth and superiority games. Take care of one another. Be empathetic. Be kind. Be supportive. Be brave. Be fierce.

Be better _beings._

And your stay in the universe will be much _better_ —take it from a travel agent.
