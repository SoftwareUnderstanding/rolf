### Acknowledgments

### The Goodreads' group M/M Romance has been an important part of my development as a writer, not just because it gave me the opportunity to learn about the innumerable good M/M romance authors out there but also to hone my craft with the help of their annual DON'T READ IN THE CLOSET event.

### This event involves so many fabulous people, from those who have the courage to post a prompt, asking for a story, to those who help with the herculean task of organize and publish the stories and the subsequent anthologies. All the members in between these two stages also deserve a shout out because they take time from their busy lives to help with beta-ing, proofreading and encouraging seasoned writers and those members who hesitantly but valiantly decide to dip their toes in the delicious waters of man-on-man romance writing.

Kudos to every single one of the beautiful people around the word that participate in these events, and especially to those who read Darkest Before Dawn (The Masked Man Serenade) and How I Lost It on Planet X and asked for more.

### STORY 1

**DARKEST BEFORE DAWN (THE MASKED MAN SERENADE)**

### It's been five blasted years since the dust plague wiped out 90% of the population of Nova Gaia. I guess I was one of the lucky ones, left to scrape out a living amid the ruins of the abandoned colonies.

### Truth be told, I'd be dead now if it wasn't for him. I've never seen his face, and I've never heard him speak. I'd think he's just another dust-dream, except he always seems to appear when I most need him...

### *This story was written for the Goodreads' group

### CHAPTER ONE

_Blast me_.

If Alaric Aquinas hadn't been ravenous, he wouldn't have been chasing the furry thing; ergo he wouldn't be in this predicament, hanging from a precipice. A damned man-made precipice nonetheless, outcome of the improvised junkyard when people started to throw everything they didn't need anymore, into this former depression of the terrain.

Perhaps, today was his last day on Nova Gaia.

A mighty fine day to end twenty-six years of shenanigans.

The straps about Alaric's torso (preventing his fall) were not meant to support his weight, just to carry the few things he used whenever he was away from his quarters. Weak after so many days without food, he wasn't strong enough to propel himself upward, not even to promote a swift, undramatic death by swinging a little.

His pappa would have said Alaric should give a better fight before giving up. The only thing he was fighting right now (besides hunger) was fricking gravity, and one needed machines to win the constant battle against that bitch.

Every time Alaric opened his eyes in the dwindling twilight, vertigo seized him. He was pressing his eyelids so hard they trembled in a rebellious effort to betray him, to make him meet his last moment with frightening awareness and flailing arms.

Something smacked him between his closed eyes. Luckily, he was wearing his goggles. That would have been annoyingly painful otherwise.

A rope.

Can it be?

The miraculous rope was long enough to circle his waist. If the straps yielded now, he wouldn't fall. Phew, he wasn't afraid of heights, but it's not the same when you don't have anything under your feet. All he needed now was to find strength to pull himself up and fast. Maybe this time he could have the chance to talk to his savior.

Helping Alaric every time he met with trouble, the strange man in a gas mask had kept his distance, never exchanging words, just letting his presence be known.

Curiosity moved Alaric to act swiftly more than the actual sense of danger. He longed for an opportunity to face his protector. The masked man had been haunting his dreams and— lately—even his waking moments. It had become a compulsion stronger than hunger and survival. It had inflamed his desire for company.

Alaric knew it had a lot to do with worldlier things than gratitude, in a very testosterone-seeks-testosterone kind of way. In his dreams, he unclothed the stranger without removing the gas mask. He frankly did not care what his savior looked like. The only important thing was how good that man had been to him, without asking for anything in return.

In a place with so few people left, kindness was a rare oddity. All went about their lives paying as little attention as possible to other survivors. The natural, human instinct to seek for the comfort of a group had been forsaken for that of isolation. Fears fathered on the illogical claim that gatherings might bring back the dust plague.

Alaric was finally on his feet, running toward the place where he saw the glint of the dying light on the visor of the gas mask. It was too late though, all he found was the rabbit he had been chasing impaled on a stick, like a macabre offering. His protector didn't even give him the chance to blow a kiss in his direction now that he had summoned the courage to do so.

I have the shittiest timing in the galaxy.

He quickly changed his goggles to thermal recognition in a last effort to see if the man was still around. Useless, everything around him was colder than a dog's nose.

Strained and frustrated, Alaric decided to set camp in the first decaying building he found outside the improvised junkyard. He hadn't encountered survivors this far in the outskirts of the city before. He did a cursory examination of the place (to confirm he was alone) and started to skin the rabbit.

He broke some chairs to start a fire and used the stick the rabbit had been delivered on to roast it. His place was almost at the other end of the city, and the night was too cold to be wandering when he could rest here by this nice fire with a sated stomach.

If the man hadn't scurried like a scared pigeon, Alaric would have loved to share his food.

Be honest with yourself Alaric, you'd share with him food, mouth, hands, cock, hole, and everything in between.

As he chewed a roasted strip of meat, he pondered all the things he couldn't do with the masked man, adjusting his intruding cock. He was messy enough after the junkyard snafu to consider a hasty masturbatory release. No, he was going to wait until he could do it at his own leisure in the security of his own quarters. GM deserved better than a mechanical, uninspired tug, and Alaric deserved to clean himself properly afterward. He had an adequate amount of water contained for a decent bath.

Alaric chuckled inwardly; this was the second time he had thought about the masked man as GM. Calling his savior Gas Mask was too impersonal, GM sounded like a friend's nickname, and he wanted to feel close to this silent protector. Not to mention that little interaction with other human beings really helped with the unrestricted explosion of wishful thinking and fricking gas-mask-gazing fantasies.

He readied himself to sleep on the marble floor of the abandoned hotel lobby, draping about him bedclothes from one of the rooms and hoping with all his heart for the opportunity to be face-to-mask with the stranger without the need to be in danger.

The founders had brought myths saying a rabbit's foot was a good luck charm, maybe Alaric's good luck charm was a gas mask at the end.

****

Blessed be the Universe, for I was able to help him again.

Sule Sarong's Personal Log - Standard date 5772.03.12

When Sule discovered the handsome lad, it had been raining. Sule rounded a corner and by pure chance looked up. The vision was there, naked and pale in the filtered light of the morning. The weathered green, double doors behind him and the ochre and pink façade of the two-story building did nothing but enhance his lean frame. The contours of his long arms ended in manly hands firmly grasping the wrought-iron balcony. With his body tilted a little forward, as if to catch the blessing of the rain more easily, the naked dream had his eyes close and a line of happiness curved the plump lips on a square masculine face.

Struck by something more powerful than lightning, Sule staggered out of sight, just in case the young man looked down. Sule stood there frozen, until he tasted the rain and realized he was gaping in idyllic awe.

Nova Gaia architecture had been designed after Earth's Belle Époque before the Great War, and the ornate building had two statues not far from the vision's balcony. Those representations of beauty were mere children's doodles compared to the willowy godling enjoying the rain.

The place wasn't far from his own; ergo it amazed him how it was possible he hadn't seen this man before. Sule floated—enthralled—on the street until the lad became bored or cold and moved inside without even looking down at the street once.

The first time Sule helped the handsome lad, he was wearing his gas mask. It had been a particularly dusty day, and he had it on as a precaution. Now, he kept using it so the lad would know it was the same stranger helping him every time because it had a distinctive blue mark. However, Sule had never had the courage to introduce himself.

Nova Gaia recovered quicker than the humans who thought they had conquered her. A lustrum after the dust plague, Nova Gaia was lush again, while the sparse human population had reverted to an age long before the colonization of this planet. The devices running on extended-life batteries still worked, but those that needed constant renewal had been abandoned since there weren't enough skilled survivors to keep things in working condition.

Hundreds of years of human civilization in Nova Gaia had been destroyed in less than six standard months by a plague with no rational or scientific explanation. Powerful furnaces, wielders of the metallurgy-based industry of the planet, had been used to incinerate the insane amount of bodies left by the dust plague in its wake and to avoid a second tide of disease originated by the indiscriminate decomposition. Ironic since during the Second Industrial Revolution and France's Belle Époque on Earth the theory to eradicate diseases had been developed.

Large Industries were inconsequential; there were no masses to consume. Cattle and poultry roamed freely in the mountains far from the outskirts of the one-time prosperous colonies. People survived mostly from the animals that were never truly for human consumption: rabbits, dogs, doves, cats. All former pets and therefore stuck within the cities.

Sule hadn't eaten a dog or a cat yet, he tried to stick to rabbits and doves. Occasionally, a hunting party would go to the mountains and come back with meats. Meats, they would exchange for sexual favors.

As long as the man was clean, Sule hadn't had problems with it, and his stomach had always thanked him greatly afterward. Now, after the vision at the balcony had entered his life, the thought of another man joining him felt somewhat on the verge of disloyalty. So invested was his mind in the lad, it was only appropriate for his body to follow suit.

The plague had left the survivors so melancholic that there weren't even the usual hoarders trying to keep goods for themselves and profit. Anyone could go to the stores and get clothing and footwear. Scarves and hoods were the most popular articles since many survivors presented facial abrasions.

Perhaps the lad thinks I'm disfigured because of the gas mask.

Saddened but grateful to be alive, most people kept to themselves, interacting very little with others, just attentive to their com-devices, waiting for the signal of the long awaited rescue, coming from any of the other colonized planets a couple of light-years away from Nova Gaia.

Sule stared at the two moons, muted guardians of their night. Nova Gaia had three moons but one was retrograde, and they were so infrequently together in the dark sky that a myth existed saying every time the three moons were together a catastrophe would befall.

Many said the dust plague had started after the three moons had been seen together.

There was only one bright thing in Sule's firmament, and he wondered where his lovely vision was spending this night.

### CHAPTER TWO

The thick head of GM's cock painted Alaric's lips with delicious fluids in rapid brushes. His body was aflame waiting for the imminent penetration after so much yearning. Then GM did a wicked thing, sweeping Alaric's nostrils with the raging head. So naughty.

Blast me.

Alaric opened his eyes to discover a dog licking his nose.

He could hear the amused voice of his maman in the distance. "That's what happens when you don't wash your mouth before bed." He sprang to a sitting position, startling the little perpetrator covered in a mane like an unruly mop. A mop that must have been white when brand new and now was dirty-water-colored.

At least the doggy wasn't feral. It wouldn't have been nice to wake up to the pain of his face being ripped unceremoniously. "Little fellow, the lick-fest is over."

Alaric hadn't used his voice in a long time, and it was rough, sounding more like a fricking growl, which drew a yip from the little mop. "It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you." He stood up and went to the sealed container where he had left the entrails of his gas-mask-delivered supper. He opened the can and put it on the marble floor. "Here, you can have this. They are not my favorites."

Leaving the little mop, munching desperately, he walked to the entrance of the abandoned hotel. It was that surreal moment—darkest before dawn—when for a second everything stood frozen waiting for the sun to chase away horror and obscurity. The promise that no matter what, day always followed night.

A muffled noise snapped him out of his contemplation, like many people heavily dragging their feet. Alaric turned his head away from the changing sky and saw it. At the far end of the street, an irregular column of survivors walked. As he stared agape, more survivors joined the bizarre march.

In five years, he had not seen this concentration of people before. Alaric gathered his few things and went toward them, happy that the little mop didn't follow him. It would have been sad to resort to eating him at some point.

Almost at the end of the silent procession, an old lady in a hovering cart (with a battery so low that it was moving sadly as if somebody was pushing it) smiled at him. Alaric walked beside her cart. "Good morning, mother. What's going on?"

"A blessed day for you, boy. Hadn't you heard? Rescue is coming! The survivors in this area should go to the spaceport close to the Tyrrhenian Sea."

That was a journey of three standard days, and at the pace the survivors were moving, it would take them a standard-week to get there. "Wonderful news, mother." Alaric wondered why she was alone. Probably all her family was dead; at least she had it in her to look forward to a new life somewhere else.

Alaric pondered as he walked beside the hovering cart. He must keep with him a few mementos if he was to start anew on another planet. He didn't want to get old and forget what his parents, brothers and sisters looked like before the plague yanked them away from him.

"Excuse me, mother. I wish you a safe journey. I must go back to my quarters." Alaric took her bony hand and kissed it. "Your blessing, please."

"May the spirits of your ancestors guide you, and my blessing goes with you, my boy."

Alaric bowed to her and left running with all his might.

Panting heavily, Alaric reached the top floor of the two-story building he called home. He retrieved the hand-size painting of his family in its beautifully gilded frame. As much as technology gave them the opportunity to have holographic files, it was tradition to keep a painted family portrait. He had requested to have the full-sized that adorned the family room reduced to have it on his nightstand. Now, it would be the only important thing from Nova Gaia flying with him to a new planet.

He studied it one last time before wrapping it with a cloth to secure it in his backpack. His maman and pappa sat while he and his siblings stood behind them. Alaric was in the center, since he was the youngest, his sisters each on one side, and his two brothers completing the group on both extremes. His maman and sisters looked ethereal with their high hair and jewels, short sleeves and pristine gloves beyond their elbows, all dark-haired beauties. His pappa sat with his top hat resting on his lap, elegant and stoic with such a thick moustache that always tickled Alaric when his father kissed him goodnight as a kid. All the brothers had their top hats on, and all men wore morning frocks, waistcoats and cravats. They were the image of cordiality and prosperity.

His pappa would have wanted him to give a good fight and not be sad and pathetic at this crossroads. His maman would have been encouraging him to take several changes of underpants for the journey. His brothers and sisters would have been fluttering around him jesting and laughing and wishing him a safe trip.

Alaric hastily packed water, flashlights, and _underpants_. He was used to going without food for a couple of days, and surely, their rescuers would feed them.

He ran; it was time to join the throng of survivors on their way to a new planet.

By the time Alaric reached the limits of the city, the survivors were nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they had realized they were moving insanely slow.

"Well, well, what have we here?" A very unfriendly voice called behind him.

It was a trio of men, who usually came back to the city from the mountains with cattle meat to trade. "Oh, hello, gentlemen. Heard the good news?" Alaric commented, happy to find out he wasn't the last one to leave the city. He had never been around them long enough to learn their names, maybe this time he would.

"Yeah, we heard. Mind if we join you?" The tallest of the group said, ogling him strangely.

"Sure, the more the better," Alaric answered nonchalantly, although inside him alarms were furiously sending distress signals.

The shortest and most menacing of the group had a wicked look on his flat face and said gleefully, "Exactly, the more the better."

Alaric wasn't sure if the right action was to flee or prepare himself to fight like a feral beast. These men had never been extremely friendly, he had exchanged sexual favors with them for food, but something was wrong this time. What could they do, kill him? What would be the point? The only thing worth killing on this planet under the circumstances was food, and Alaric didn't think these men had suddenly turned into cannibals.

If they wanted sex, they could ask for it, couldn't they? After so many weeks of wet dreams with the man wearing the gas mask, he might not enjoy it, but it wouldn't be an aberration of the customs. Alaric wondered if GM had received the rescue signal and was on his way to the spaceport with all the others.

Alaric selfishly hoped that if he were in danger surrounded by these men, GM would be close to give him a helping hand— _again_.

What a shitty moment to be unarmed.

They walked for a standard hour when they reached a part of the road with trees on one side and a burnt field on the other. The trio paced behind Alaric, and that kept his hair on ends. He was seriously considering going back to the city when two of the men grabbed him by the arms and the third yanked his trousers down, underpants included. "What the...?"

"Shhh, we just want to play a little," said one in his ear, licking his earlobe.

Alaric thrashed to free himself, but he couldn't use his legs to kick with his trousers around his knees and the awkward face down position. "Sons' of bitches, you don't need to force me. Be decent and ask."

"Ah, pretty thing, but this ain't trade, this is rape." The one holding his legs, spat evilly as they carried him toward the group of trees.

"Let me go, you fuckers, let me go." Alaric was frantic, and the men were easily overpowering him, no matter how much he thrashed.

"Yeah."

"That's what we want."

"Put up a fight."

"Make it interesting."

Alaric heard the voices, but in his wild struggle he couldn't discern who was speaking.

The one holding his legs, let go with an "Ouch!" One of the others jerked his arm before releasing him with a "What the fuck?"

Alaric landed ass first on the ground and before he lost consciousness (thanks to the angry reception of a tree trunk), he saw the man in the gas mask serving steaming jabs and ferocious kicks to his attackers.

A gas mask was indeed his lucky charm.

****

Blessed be the Universe for the lad is safe in my arms.

Sule Sarong's Personal Log - Standard date 5772.03.13

Sule had taken care of the three idiots trying to force his lad, bringing him back to the city in his transport. They had several days before the rescue party arrived at the spaceport. It was sad to think that now that help was on its way, the survivors would start turning against each other.

Trying not to traumatize the lad further, Sule had just pulled his clothes together and waited patiently for him to come back on his own. He caressed the disheveled locks he had dreamed about so many nights. Long, dark lashes begged him for a kiss, a kiss he couldn't bring himself to steal.

Since Sule had never been close enough to the lad to learn the color of his eyes, he wondered. Sule knew they were fair, in plain contrast with his dark, manly eyebrows; eyebrows he tentatively traced not wanting to disturb the peaceful unconsciousness of this dreamboat.

And when your eyes've shone

Upon my face

And your smile's blinded me

With nonnatural radiance

I will happily die

Knowing there's

No more to yearn.

Sule recited mentally as he caressed a pale cheek, with the back of his fingers, in a silent glide of nails and knuckles. As much as Sule didn't want to disturb the lad, he couldn't help himself. So close for him to have, it was impossible to put distance between them now.

The vision leaned onto his hand with a pleased hum and opened his eyes. They were pale blue, like a cloudless sky in the moment the sun was at its highest. "Your name," the lad murmured, his voice rasped as if his throat was extremely dry.

The gas mask came off, as Sule was just waiting for the lad to recognize him first, and, holding the lad's hand, he spoke, "My name is Sule Sarong, your humble servant." He drew the hand to his lips and kissed it. "Allow me the gift of your name."

The vision smiled, caressing with trembling fingers his stubbly cheek. "Alaric Aquinas," he pronounced calmly. "I owe you so much, Sule." This time he traced Sule's lips with a single, now steadier, finger.

"You owe me nothing, Alaric. You safety is my biggest reward." Sule went to his feet to get something for Alaric to drink. He settled the gas mask on a nearby table and poured water.

Wasn't Alaric a king who conquered Rome? How fitting.

Alaric sat, looking at Sule with adoring eyes, and then assessed his state, as he accepted the offered glass. "Thank you. I'm a mess." There was mud and grass all over him. "I'm defiling your bed." He chuckled softly. "Please, forgive me."

Sule sat again—close, so close—and smiled openly. "It doesn't matter. It's not that we will stay here for long. We must go to the spaceport by the Tyrrhenian Sea soon." He took the emptied glass from Alaric's hands. "I can offer you a bath, if it pleases you."

"Only if you share it with me," Alaric uttered with a falsely solemn face.

"Are you sure? After what happened to you, I wouldn't impose my presence in such an intimate way."

"I'm positive I want you there with me, as I am positive there will be another dawn tomorrow."

### CHAPTER THREE

Sule had said his name, stressing the final e, in the same way his tutor had done when Alaric was learning his vowels as a child. The tutor had held a card showing an animal with large, hanging ears and a long trunk that didn't exist on Nova Gaia but was still used to teach children the alphabet. "E-le-phan-t," his tutor had enunciated condescendingly. An action Alaric hadn't understood at the time but now was clear as water.

Lately, Alaric learned that the inhabitants of an outer-rim planet had characteristics very similar to Earth's pachyderms. "The patterns of the Universe are repeated endlessly and with wisdom," his pappa had said in the middle of one of their frequent and entertaining discussions.

As Alaric watched Sule strip out of his brocade morning coat and waistcoat, and discovered the sultry coat of hair adorning Sule's chest as the white shirt became undone, he wished he hadn't gone through the chemical removal of all his body hair. The only follicles active in his body were the ones on his scalp and eyebrows.

With the gas mask gone, a stark new concept of desire exploded inside Alaric. His fingertips still tingled with the sensation of Sule's incipient beard, and Alaric wanted that wonderful stubble scrapping every inch of his body.

"Are you unwell?" Sule asked, just underpants covering his magnificent, lean body. "Is the lump on your head hurting?" His dark locks swayed forward as he tilted his head inquisitively.

Alaric shook his head. Absent (like a dummy) and sure that he had the silliest star-struck look on his face. He wasn't drooling because the Universe was merciful. He swallowed audibly and said, "I've dreamt of you so much. I still don't know if this is just another of my naughty dreams or blissful reality."

Sule smiled, with his mouth and his amazing steel eyes, and walked toward him. Sule took Alaric's hand and rested it on his chest over his heart, the hairy plain—hard and enticing. "Do you hear this?"

Alaric did, hating the clothes that still covered his own body. He nodded, hearing and feeling the steady heartbeat scorching his hand, melting his body.

The underpants close to his chest were tented—proof that Alaric wasn't alone in his ardor.

"Let me help you out of these clothes," Sule murmured as he pulled Alaric up and held him in his arms for a moment.

Sule's eyes were the color of flaming steel, and they devoured Alaric. Every single cell about Alaric's body tingled in anticipation. Why was he still clothed?

The removal of each garment was accompanied by a feathery caress on the discovered area, Alaric wanted to close his eyes and drift, but Sule's eyes held him in place, alert, conscious. And that mouth, that mouth surrounded by amazing stubble was an equally powerful magnet. It took all the restraint his body was capable of not to be the first to venture for a taste of those lips.

"Oh," Alaric gasped, remembering he didn't have his backpack. He was happy to be there, but losing his family portrait immediately dampened his mood.

"Don't worry, it's over there." Sule pointed toward a corner, as Alaric leaned on him to remove his shoes. The backpack lay inconspicuously, covered by dirt, but apparently whole.

Alaric thanked Sule in hushed tones as they moved to the next room, which was an ample bathroom. Sule took a low stool and settled it in the middle of a large bathtub. "Let me sponge you first to remove all that caked dirt."

Sule moved about, collecting items for his chore, while the bobbing of his tempting cock, behind thin fabric, enthralled Alaric.

Blast me. I'm going to make a fool of myself.

"Where did all this water come from?" Alaric asked (just for the sake of asking) to distract his feverish brain.

"It's the filtered water of a hundred rains." Sule beamed, pride coloring his tone. He pointed to an immense tank in the middle of the inner patio. "It also irrigates a little green house."

Then Sule wasn't simply lurking around the corners waiting to rescue him. Alaric didn't know whether to feel disappointed or grateful that Sule wasn't just a harebrained stalker.

By the time Sule finally started to sponge him with soapy water, his cock head peeked from its foreskin cocoon demanding attention, and no amount of fresh (or filtered) water could conquer the fire running over Alaric's face.

Hey, horniness trumps embarrassment.

The worst (or should he say the best) part was when Sule circled Alaric's ass cheeks with maddening slowness and spread them, rubbing lovingly his puckered hole, as if to make him beg to be fucked senseless without remorse. Who could have told him that a man _literally_ wiping his fricking ass would be the most erotic thing he had ever experienced? He was lost, light-years beyond propriety.

None said a word. The only thing accompanying Sule's torturing and delightful ministrations was the heavy almost strangled breathing of both.

An eternity later, all the filth of the morning's bad experience had been drained, and they were face-to-face, knelt in the bathtub with water happily splashing about them. Alaric couldn't get enough of Sule's hairy chest rubbing against his, nor the celestial scrape of that stubble over his swollen lips.

Sule's ass was a masterpiece, and Alaric refused to cease his kneading of the hard muscles. They were mutually obsessed with their behinds because Sule couldn't stop either. He pulled their groins together, steering Alaric's ass and making their cocks mingle their encouraging fluids.

"I've dreamt of you so much," Sule whispered moving one hand from Alaric's ass to his groin.

That strong hand around his shaft was Alaric's undoing. "I'm sure I did it more." He chuckled with a strangled gasp.

"Who did what is not important anymore. You're here in my arms." Then Sule did something Alaric couldn't have foreseen. Inserting a finger in Alaric's foreskin, Sule circled the head like a warlock from an ancient tale stirring a concoction, perhaps to destroy, perhaps to create life.

"Blast me," was all Alaric could hiss as he rolled his eyes. A thousand commands escaped from his purpled head, ordering goose bumps and flashes of light, and Sule inserted one finger of the hand still kneading Alaric's ass into that burning hole, making him whimper.

Squeaky clean as they were after the meticulous bath, the fluids oozing from their cocks could only taste like ambrosia. Sule proved this, licking the smeared finger and sharing the flavor with Alaric in a passionate kiss.

Invaded and giddy (thanks to both hands commanding him), Alaric replicated Sule's maneuvers, extracting moans of approval and grunts of encouragement.

Each mirrored the other's actions, tasting and kissing, fingering and rubbing. Water splashed with their efforts because they only gave each other space for narrow moves, bucking and grinding, until all that was left was to stroke their cocks to completion.

Alaric exploded first, torn between the hand stroking his cock, the finger plucking his prostate and the mouth covering his mouth. He became a million pieces, his consciousness still whole—thanks to Sule's sweet gravity.

The wicked clench around Alaric's finger (with Sule's orgasm not far behind from his) brought a new wave of ecstasy to his trembling frame. Both rode the high crest not wanting to untwine their bodies now or in the future.

****

Blessed be the Universe, for I've known bliss on the lips of Alaric Aquinas.

Sule Sarong's Personal Log - Standard date 5772.03.15

They made love for two standard days. They learned each other's geography, from north to south, from east to west, kissing creases, licking plains, engulfing summits. They discovered and adored every inch of their inflamed bodies with abandon. The diminishing of that bonfire was never in sight.

"It's time to leave this nest, Alaric." Sule told the object of his desire with sadness. They didn't know under what conditions they would do the interplanetary journey, ergo if they would be sharing the same living space. Many, many people would certainly surround them by the description of the column of survivors Alaric had given him.

But even if there are a thousand survivors, it would be nothing but the meager remains of a city with more than two million inhabitants before the dust plague.

"Are you sure your transport has enough energy to take us there?" Alaric asked, still tangled in dark sheets, making him look like one of the moons in the midnight sky.

"More than necessary. If we depart tonight, we could arrive at the spaceport in less than forty-eight standard hours." Sule sat on the bed, offering Alaric a plate with his share of the roasted doves and Nova-Gaian potatoes he had prepared for their meal.

Alaric ate silently, just looking at Sule, a mixture of adoration and apprehension in his pale blue eyes, cross-legged and immersed in a pool of satin darkness.

"Speak your mind, sweetheart." Sule caressed one cheek when Alaric stopped chewing. The lad leaned into his touch.

"What if they separate us?" Alaric scrunched his nose as if not wanting to delve too seriously into that thought.

This fretting lad was the one who even in the middle of an ordeal kept fighting, as Sule had witnessed every time he had come to his rescue. Sule didn't want to make Alaric weak just because he was near. "Would you let that happen?"

The response was a hissed syllable. "No."

After a sip of his water, Sule encouragingly murmured, "That's the answer I was hoping for." He took their plates and settled them on a nearby table. He crawled on the bed until they were face-to-face, his eyes boring into Alaric's. "I'm absolutely positive, if I'm the one who needs rescue at some point you'd prevail." He slid his lips over Alaric's without kissing, just relishing their texture. The tip of their noses brushed in silent invitation, an echo of things they did earlier.

Alaric gave him a quick smooch. "Totally true. My middle name is berserk." He chuckled softly. "There's something about you that makes me want to be rescued, and I swear I didn't look for trouble just to see if you appeared. They were all honest-to-Universe mishaps." He lifted his right hand as if making an oath.

"I believe you. I know there's spunk in you." Sule pushed Alaric to lie down, savoring the muscles of Alaric's square shoulder.

Snickering, Alaric blurted, "There's not much left, after what's been going on in this bedroom."

It took five standard seconds for Sule to grasp the meaning of Alaric's words, and he exploded in laughter. "And there's going to be less in a moment."

"I'm banking on that." Alaric whispered as he closed his eyes and opened his lips to accept him.

They left the abandoned city that night, the bark of dogs their only farewell.

Having learned about their bodies previously, they used the journey to learn about their life before the dust plague. The expectations that were, and those that were coming to be with the nearness of a new start on another planet.

They reached the spaceport with the second night more than well advanced. Two enormous spaceships, phallic and stunning, illuminated the area, and a male voice continuously gave information through a loud PA.

Gathering their backpacks, they walked toward the reception booth at the gate of the spaceport, hand in hand, leaving the transport and their previous life behind them.

"Did you notice that?" Sule pointed at the sky with his free hand, stopping their march.

"Oh, GM." Alaric sighed, somewhat embarrassed. "I did, and it's supposed to be a bad omen. That's why I didn't mention it." Alaric pressed his lips, squeezing Sule's hand and looking up in the direction of the three moons, visible after the dispersing clouds.

Sule liked that moniker; it would always remind him of how they met. He squeezed the lad's hand back, "Never for us, Alaric. These three moons, we will never see again, proclaim the beginning of a different life." He winked and nodded—smiling—lost in the pale blue eyes that seemed molten silver thanks to the scarce light. "Besides, it's almost a new day."

Alaric stood on his toes to nuzzle Sule's cheek and gave him a quick smooch. "Yes. It's always darkest before dawn."

### CHAPTER ONE

"You know there's a curse, right?"

He rolled his eyes. "As much as archeology sometimes delves into fantasy realms, a curse is the last thing on my worries list."

"What could be a bigger worry than a curse on a remote planet, Darien?"

"The program is for ten years." He hated it when he sounded so whiny.

"Fresh from Academy, top of your class, this is the Dream Mission for a newbie." Ben mimicked his eye-roll. "As long as you don't take the effing curse into consideration."

" _Byotch_ , are you trying to scare me?" Darien stuck his tongue out. "I've taken down bigger men than you."

"Pfft, I'm not even going with you." Ben sipped his herbal tea, the sharp concoction offending Darien's nose. "But I'm gonna be the one they send if you get lost or zombie'd or gone for good." An arched eyebrow adorned his square features.

Today was an eye-rolling day. Ben had the frame of a spaceship and the strength of twenty Velusian bulls. He'd fought all kinds of beasts on countless planets and had been in three intergalactic wars, but now he was worried about a myth?

For the sake of the Seven Planets, we are scientists, warriors, effing descendants of Terra.

"Ten years is not that long, anyway." Ben's dismissive tone grated on Darien's nerves more than the green sting assaulting him.

"That's easy for you to say, _whore_. You'll be getting all the cock and ass your slutty heart desires around the effing galaxy."

"And what is it to you, my sassy virgin?"

_Ouch._ Darien had been busy studying hard, all right? Boys were the last thing in his head. He always thought he'd have his share of manly delights after finishing Space Academy. Now, it seemed his calculations had been just a behemoth truncation error. Ben always said Darien must be the last red-haired virgin of the galaxy, a disgrace to his fiery genes. However, he wasn't going to sit there and let Ben flaunt the notches on his bedposts in his face.

_It was MY CHOICE_.

"I'm gonna be stuck with two old prunes and a bunch of androids." Not a chance in Nova to give his virginity to those two; besides, they were lovers. Major snooze. Commitment.

Ugh.

"A man thirty years your senior is not a prune." Effing Ben liked them with white hair. What a silver fox chaser.

"Both old wizards will be like a hundred by the time we finish the excavation." There went the whine again. If Darien didn't get his shit together, the ancient ritual of hara-kiri would be mild compared to what he was gonna be forced to resort to.

"Darien, this is a lifetime opportunity, a chance in a billion. After this ten-year mission, you are secure until your last breath." Another sip of obnoxious aromatic tea. "If you opt out now, it will not only be career suicide but a major family disgrace."

Irked, Darien slammed the table with both hands, making everything on it rattle hysterically. "Then what was all that effing babbling about a curse?"

Ben folded his napkin as if Darien's crimson face were a delightful sunset. "I just love to mess with your head, little brother."

Grr. The byotch.

****

"Computer, access the records of Planet XZ345, archeological research." It was time to review the so-called curse.

The planet was technically a desert that didn't have any known fauna, and there were no records of sentient inhabitants. The Pyramids of old Perth had been discovered during a reconnaissance expedition to a nearby system and ignited an ancestral flame since these abandoned monuments were similar to ones registered in old records from Terra Prima.

Six expeditions had been sent to XZ345; all had lasted on the planet less than a few standard months. No mechanical dysfunction had curtailed the research expeditions, but there were severe symptoms of stress and melancholy in the human members of both military and archeological crews.

Ancient scrolls discovered during Expedition One, and finally translated by the return of Expedition Four, spoke of the evacuation of the planet. Wars had decimated the population and plagues threatened what was left of their civilization. A great search was issued to find a family that would remain on the planet to safeguard the sacred temples of Meha until the return of the fleeing expatriates. One male of the family would serve as supreme wielder of the protective curse. If such a family had been found, it was not registered on the recovered scrolls.

That has to be the most effing purple byotch raffle in the Universe.

Baptized after Regulus H. Perth, the General in command of the Reconnaissance Fleet, the pyramids consisted of impressive and extended temples on the southern hemisphere of the planet. The dry climate had conserved the ruins in excellent condition, from an archeological point of view.

Plans to repopulate the planet with a human colony had never crystalized due to the inability to maintain an archeological site at minimum.

Darien turned the screen off. Why send another expedition if six others had already failed? A bigger reason must exist to divert resources to such a cause. At any rate, the Federation's persistence in exploring "Planet Xad" (as it was known in archeological circles due to the melancholic and depressive outbursts of the crews) was unfathomable.

The seventh expedition consisted of three humans and a hundred androids, divided into field researchers and military contingency.

A nasty feeling churned Darien's guts. Perhaps, he'd just gotten the winning ticket in another _byotch_ imploding raffle.

****

Honeyed Agate

Orange Flames

Outlander Minister

Heart of Gold

"Seriously? That's what the Oracle said?" Kekoa banged the control panel, making General Ur and the screen jump. "Sounds more like a fucking joke than a riddle. That could be anyone. Is it a male at least?"

"Yes, that much was affirmative." The old man obviously forgave Kekoa's temper because he understood Kekoa's ordeal: stuck on an empty planet guarding sacred temples for another thousand years.

"And did the Oracle say how I'm gonna meet this _Outlander Minister_?" Kekoa growled, frustration winning the race against anger.

"He will come to you, Kekoa. Have patience," General Ur implored, more father than high-ranked officer.

"Nobody comes to this planet unless you send them. The only other option would be a crash-landing. Who knows what that might bring?" Kekoa caressed his growing erection, hidden from the general's eyes. "I can't wait for my mate to appear, Ur. I need to fuck now."

"Entertainment can be arranged. Give me a couple of hours." General Ur smiled, complicit.

"Make it one hour, and send two strong ones. I'm in a mood." This time Kekoa squeezed his rock-hard cock. He grunted mutedly. "Thanks, Ur."

General Ur nodded solemnly. "May Meha guard you." He became a dot on the screen.

Funny since Kekoa was the Guardian of goddess Meha's temples. He was truly in a mood today. Something boiled inside him, and he couldn't guess what it was.

"Master, your bath is ready," the head android murmured behind him.

Warm water awaited him in the adjoining room. He thanked the android and disrobed, walking nude toward the welcoming retreat. Perhaps after a relaxing bath he would not be as destructive as he felt right now. He counted on being in a better mood by the time _his entertainment_ arrived.

Less than a standard hour later, the expert hand of another household android had untangled all the knotted muscles in Kekoa's body, and he waited, degusting aged liquor.

Just a short satin robe covered his frame as the two men entered his alcove. Both were tall and muscled, much like him, with the same white hair distinctive of his race. More than courtesans, these two seemed to be from the military elite, which was excellent; Kekoa aimed for a rough session.

He rose to his feet, swirling the liquor in its concave goblet with his left hand. "Gentlemen, drinks?" His steeled weapon already leaked, looking for battle with urgent need.

They accepted with interested eyes, appraising exposed muscles between the open folds of his robe. They wore loose garments, easy to dispose, suggestively framing their hard-honed forms.

Kekoa handed them their drinks and raised his. "A toast." He leered at them with mischievous enthusiasm. "To sated holes and dripping cocks."

### CHAPTER TWO

The head android entered his study with a soft knock on the door. "Master?"

Kekoa turned from the painting he was creating to address him. "Yes?"

"We have raised the levels of gas around the temples' area, but these foreigners are not suffering the effects yet."

It had been four standard months since this excursion landed. Their excavations were reaching a critical place within the main temple complex, time for him to take matters into his own hands. Luckily, the exploration party only had three humans.

"Get me the coordinates of the youngest of the group." By experience, younglings were more susceptible to so-called supernatural demonstrations. _Impressionable_ would be a more accurate expression.

Kekoa had only shown himself to the second Cygnus Federation expedition. He couldn't believe the Federation insisted on digging on his planet. War destroyed his civilization; they vowed to avoid the annihilation of others unless a direct attack was issued.

Releasing a toxin that would provoke disorientation and longing for the homeland was what they'd done countless times to get rid of this kind of pest. For some unknown reason, it wasn't working at all this time. He knew they used filtering masks, but it was nearly impossible to keep those devices on permanently. He would go crazy if he had to wear such a contraption all the time.

"And prepare my armor. I'm going to the surface." Kekoa gave another brush to his masterpiece. At least he was in an excellent disposition. Tyke and Sun, his military, unofficial pets, had left the planet earlier that day.

"Yes, master. The coordinates will be ready for you in the control room." The head android bowed and took his leave.

These expeditions had never come heavily armed, proving they were here for scientific business only. However, his people had planted scrolls in an alternate language—not related directly to his civilization—with the sole purpose of alerting these invaders of a curse that was true... but not in the way described.

Greed was the curse of my race.

Close to extinction by their own insane quarrels, the remnants decided to start anew in a different location as far as possible from their birthplace. The oracles were consulted and a planet chosen, but they needed to leave behind a guardian for the sacred places. The knowledge preserved in these structures couldn't be destroyed without provoking the wrath of their deity. A two thousand year commission—more than three-quarters of their lifespan—was given to Kekoa's fifth great grandfather.

It was his turn now to find his mate and have a child to be the guardian of the last vestige of their civilization on this planet. Another protector of secrets of unfathomable magnitude.

Kekoa pondered his approach to the young explorer as his armor was assembled about him. The purpose of the device was not just defensive but also to scare with its horrific morphology. Skull imagery always proclaimed disease and death, unless you were from the Ragnark system. Those wretches had their skulls visible since the moment they left their mothers' wombs.

Not a pleasing sight at all.

"Master, your target is located in sector ten, quadrant forty-eight."

The expedition's routine separated the excavations into two groups. One led by two humans and their androids, the other by the youngling and his own segment of mechanical helpers. Usually, they worked at opposite ends of the same quadrant, approximately fifty klicks away.

Now it was time to give the little invader the fright of a lifetime.

****

This effing planet is hot.

His suit supposedly breathed, but sure as Nova, Darien was slowly roasting inside it. If someone had told him one could smell the heat, he would have thought that person was batshit crazy. Now, that slight fragrance of melting metal permeated every minute of his life.

A hundred and nineteen days on this barren land was enough to get on anyone's nerves. Darien could easily see now why people got depressed here before. Yet, he was not depressed but angry. Frederick and Jacques were supreme assholes and made his life miserable. Technically, he was their boss, but since they were older they said, "Yes, sir," and did whatever the jamming asteroids they chose to do.

He couldn't even complain, because then it would be associated with his young age and his general tendency to be a whiner. But Darien wasn't a sniveling puppy; people just didn't get him. He was the first to smack himself when he was being stupid and whiny.

Darien took his damned helmet off. Planet X (for him it wasn't even Xad anymore) had excellent levels of oxygen; thus, it was ridiculous to be wearing that gadget under two scalding suns. He shook his sweaty mass of red curls. This was his only act of rebellion; regulations required his hair be no longer than a centimeter, but who was going to get there with a razor to make him comply? And to make his action more defiant, something in the gravity of the planet made his hair grow faster than usual. It already covered his ears after almost four months, becoming a turban under the helmet.

At least snow-haired assholes one and two didn't follow his lead and had their regulation buzzed haircuts. For a reason he'd never wanted to analyze, white hair nauseated him. He didn't know if it was because he associated it with old age, decay and death.

Frederick and Jacques screwing the brains out of each other has nothing to do with decaying flesh, though.

Darien had caught them twice in undesignated areas going at it like pistons. He was miffed by this insubordination, but secretly, it was more out of envy. They had one another; Darien was alone.

His increasing horniness did not help matters either. Masturbation didn't satisfy him at all. He longed for the touch of another being to conquer his itch. _Enough._ What he needed to do was focus on his task in this exterior area of Temple Alpha. All the technology of the universe, and archaeology still relied on trowel and brush for successful accomplishment, which wasn't a bad thing. Manual labor distracted him somehow.

Nevertheless, that somehow wasn't happening today.

The group of androids under his command worked methodically when suddenly, they all went face first into the dirt, all energy drained from them. The strident sound of horns deafened him; he covered his ears and shut his eyes. Darien had read somewhere of a city wall destroyed by the sound of horns; this was what it must have sounded like, enough to make anyone go crazy.

What in the Seven Planets is that?

The ground began shaking, and a figure emerged from the mound at his right. It was big and brown and crazy looking with spikes and what seemed like furious skulls. Darien thought perhaps he shouldn't have dismissed all the talk of a curse and a sacred guardian on the old documents after all. Whatever this was didn't seem friendly, and those deafening horns were making him want to scream.

With heavy steps, the bulky thing descended, everything trembling in its wake. Darien stood up and drew out his fragger, ready to shoot. He didn't have the best aim, but the thing was so massive it wouldn't take that much to put a hole in it somewhere.

Along with the chill of impending disaster, Darien felt sweat run down his spine, his entire body inside the suit completely clammy. As whiny as everyone thought he was, he was not going to roll over and let this freak send him to the next life. He wasn't leaving without at least one or two blasts left behind in the _byotch_ carcass.

The humongous monster halted with a raised hand, stopping the horns altogether. Darien heard the shrill of the energy concentrating as his fragger prepared for discharge. His determination didn't shake; even if the thing didn't possess any visible weapons, he'd never seen anything like it before, and therefore, he couldn't be confident.

Nightmare-thing directed its hands toward its head and removed it, showing that it was a helmet. What came out of the helmet left Darien stunned.

Purple Byotch!

_Magnificent_ would be insufficient to describe the beauty of the man. His eyes were pure cobalt, and his lips were pink as the first rays of the sunrise. Angular and masculine, his face ought to be in museums of every galaxy. Not even the white hair, straight and to one side, diminished the otherworldly features.

"Put your gun down, please. I am Kekoa Wana'ao, guardian and priest of this planet." The eidolon smiled, exuding ethereal charm. "What's your name, pretty one?"

"You speak my language?" If you needed a stupid question, that was the perfect one.

"I learned your language when the first group of your Cygnus Federation came to snoop around."

"But that was two hundred standard years ago!" Darien could see Ben rolling his eyes. _Obvious much?_

"So?"

"You don't look much older than me." Was Darien in dimwit mode or what?

"I'm aging well?" Kekoa uttered with a smirk, making his statement sound like a question, his amazing eyes sparkling, his pale skin bright with the sunlight.

"What did you do with my androids?"

Finally, a sensible question.

"Took them out of the way." Kekoa did everything but shrug.

"Why would you do that?"

"Because you're coming with me, pretty one," Kekoa thunder-purred, drawing closer.

Darien lost consciousness as if he had been squashed like a bug under a heavy, heavy boot.

### CHAPTER THREE

Kekoa studied the naked human on his bed. "Honeyed agate? Check. Orange flames? Check." He couldn't call those red curls anything but flames, and what about that fiery crotch? Even resting, the young man's cock was a mouthful. He continued his mental counting. "Outlander minister? Check."

The heart of gold was yet to be discovered, but three out of four was enough. If this human wasn't his mate, then what was he doing on Kekoa's planet?

His race shared enough genetic traces with humans to produce a perfect offspring without too much trouble. Now the only real issue was how to unveil his destiny to this youngling. Did he even like his own sex? Well, Kekoa would do everything in his hands to make this pretty thing fall in love with him. What was the point of having a mate if said mate didn't love you?

He drew closer to the lean, perfect body and inhaled deeply, savoring the essence before him—pure like crystalline water. "Untarnished," Kekoa rumbled, and his voiced thought woke up the sleeping mystery.

Big hazel eyes—the honeyed agates—drilled him, first wide as saucers then narrowed with suspicion. "What in the Seven Planets are you doing, sniffing me like a dog?"

"I don't know what a dog is, but it doesn't sound like a nice thing to say." Kekoa chuckled, moving his body away. "You never told me your name."

"Where am I?" He was young, but his voice was deep and rich, an invitation, a caress.

Looming over the intruder again, Kekoa asked, "Your name?"

The nameless boy dropped his eyes from Kekoa's face to his own body and let out a sound similar to a growl. "Shit, why am I naked?"

"Too many questions and no answers." Kekoa leaned forward and inhaled the perfumed sweat coming from the fire curls framing the chiseled features. He would surely nuzzle that crotch—and other parts—sooner rather than later.

"Hey, pervert, stop it." The young man pushed him by the shoulder and sat, pulling some of the bedclothes over his lap. Not fast enough to divert Kekoa from noticing that delicious cock beginning to enlarge.

"Your name."

Almost rolling his eyes, and exhaling in a funny, dramatic way, the nameless boy blew curls from his forehead. "All right, Darien Muselet is the name. Now, I want answers."

"Of course," Kekoa conceded, smiling and waggling his eyebrows.

"Are you making fun of me?" Darien asked, arching an eyebrow and narrowing his eyes again in that sexy way that made Kekoa want to devour him.

"I'd never do such a thing." Kekoa put a hand over his chest to demonstrate his sincerity.

"Well, in my culture we only waggle our eyebrows that way when we're mocking someone. So don't do that again unless you mean it."

"Point taken." Kekoa browsed the square pectorals with avid eyes. He admired the rosy nipples, so fair they were almost imperceptible on the creamy skin. This Darien was a work of art; Kekoa drooled about the front, when the back of the masterpiece proposed amusement that was even more delightful.

"Stop it."

"Was I doing something?" Although Kekoa knew extremely well what he had been doing.

"You're looking at me like I'm a meal. If you're gonna eat me, at least kill me first. Being eaten alive is not on my bucket list."

"I assure you, I intend to have my mouth near your body but not in the way you think. Androphagy is not in our customs."

The whiff of time it took Darien to understand the implications of those words rewarded Kekoa with crimson cheeks and a sulking scowl. "You're violating like a thousand intergalactic accords with your behavior, Mr. Priest."

So he remembers.

"I told you my name is keh KOE ah - wa NA aoh." He enunciated in case the boy hadn't gotten it the first time. "The priesthood is just an added title to my position as Guardian of goddess Meha's temples."

"Most priests I know are celibate," Darien grunted, pulling more fabric toward his lap.

It didn't escape Kekoa the way Darien studied him. How Darien traced with eager eyes his face and his chest, visible through the open folds of his robe. It had been a good move to leave Darien naked but keep some covering on himself. The young explorer had never been touched, but that didn't mean he wasn't burning to know another's skin. Kekoa could smell the desire spiraling from him like toxic gas from a fissure in the ground.

"So you're a priest then?" Kekoa teased, hoping that wasn't the case because then his battle to obtain the boy's heart would become a war.

Oh, but I have all kinds of weapons even against gods.

"What makes you think I'm a priest?" Darien spat with contempt. "Or celibate, if that is what you're inferring."

"I can smell a virgin from a thousand klicks," Kekoa growled. "Nothing has defiled your body, not even a kiss."

****

The man with white hair traced Darien's lower lip with his thumb, disarming him. The edge of the wide sleeve of his robe caressed his right nipple, drawing an involuntary moan from Darien. So much for trying to act like he was unaffected by Kekoa's raw sensuality.

In the back of his mind, Darien chanted, _it was my choice, my choice, my choice._

"Then what am I, a freak?" Darien couldn't be quiet. His pride demanded that he rebel against that insinuation, but he didn't want Kekoa's thumb away from his lip either.

"I would say a fortunate anomaly, instead." Kekoa's eyes bored into Darien's. "That can be swiftly remedied."

That was what Darien needed, a quick pounding to get rid of his damned virginity and become a complete man. "Yes."

Gory purple byotch!

Darien was following his brother's steps to whoredom.

Are you proud, Ben?

"Not so fast, my pretty explorer. I want you to remember your first time always." Kekoa covered Darien's mouth with his. First a brush of lips, then suction and poking; Darien opened his mouth for Kekoa to enter, and his head spun. Forget absence of gravity, this was absence of matter.

"Your tongue."

"What?"

"Give me your tongue."

As Kekoa sucked his tongue, Darien's cock grew harder than it already was. In the moment his hand moved to take care of it, he remembered the man making him dizzy was the enemy. Not just that, he had offensive white hair and—according to him—was older than the oldest person Darien knew.

He pushed Kekoa away abruptly. "I cannot do this."

But by the Seven Planets, his body craved it with desperation.

### CHAPTER FOUR

Kekoa understood Darien's reticence and offered Darien food when his stomach protested. He gave Darien garments made of dark and sinful material. Although quite fitting and not outrageous, it was a liquid caress, richer than the most exquisite silk of Darien's planet, Randell. It was an absolute pity when Kekoa appeared dressed in a similar fashion, depriving Darien of the fantastic view he had earlier. However, not everything was lost since the muscle-hugging pants and contour-adoring top gave him a constant reminder of all the concealed goodness.

Darien didn't have a clue as to how long he'd been there, but his hungriness gave him a close idea. They ate making small talk, and Kekoa insisted in veering the conversation toward sexual topics.

"To use the words of a wise man from your first expedition 'I can fuck many, but I will only love one.'" Kekoa enjoyed his drink as if oblivious to his blatant statement.

"You were there with them? There is no record of any interaction with a local." Darien acted nonchalant, but his big mouth got in the way as always. "And we don't use that word anymore."

"What word?"

"Fuck," Darien cited succinctly. "But do tell, how?"

"I know whatever happens on this planet." Kekoa shrugged elegantly.

"That's not the answer to my question. I want the mechanics." Darien wanted to be harsh, but Kekoa's handsome face kept sidetracking him.

"This planet has more secrets than a Mustafarian whore." This time the white-haired man winked.

"Can you hear my companions now?"

"Of course."

"Show me."

They walked to a control room, and Kekoa punched commands on a keypad.

Frederick's concerned voice surrounded Darien. "What are we going to do, love?"

"Standard procedure is seventy-two hours," Jacques simply quoted. "He's most likely wandering around."

"How? His transport remained at his site. All his androids were deactivated. I don't like this."

"Don't worry, sweetheart. We are the only living beings on this planet. He still has twenty hours to come back before we need to contact the Council."

"Those two are a couple?" Kekoa inquired.

Darien refrained from eye rolling. "Yes."

"You seem like you don't approve." Kekoa sounded uncannily amused.

"No comment. I need to let them know I'm okay. A _prisoner_ but okay."

"You are _not_ a prisoner," Kekoa thunder-purred, sending chills down Darien's spine.

"Then why can I not return to my base?"

"It's complicated." Kekoa paused as if weighing something up. "Your people must leave the planet at once and never set foot on it again. I'm going to make a deal with you. We are going to contact them and tell them to exit the planet, and you will stay with me here for sixty standard days as collateral. If you refuse, I'll obliterate them."

"That's coercion. What assurance do I have you will not kill me as soon as they're gone?"

"I could have done that by now, don't you think?"

Kekoa had a point there.

"Even if I accept, they won't," Darien said.

"They will because I'm going to threaten them with your life."

"How can I trust someone who speaks of killing others as he talks about the weather?"

Or sex as if it were the same thing.

"Your death is not in my plans."

Darien growled, "Oh, just contact them and shut up."

They moved to a different room, this one looking more like the bridge of a spaceship. Kekoa hailed Darien's base. "Greetings, invaders. I am Kekoa Wana'ao, guardian and priest of the sacred places you are defiling."

"How can it be so if this planet is deserted?" Jacques growled, but the interest was obvious in his narrowed eyes.

"It is not. I have your Darien Muselet in my custody, and I request your immediate departure of this planet or he will be exterminated."

"We want to see him," Frederick said, stepping beside his lover.

Kekoa allowed Darien to show himself on the screen.

"Captain, are you all right?" Darien's subordinates asked in unison.

"Yes, I am fine. Accept this bastard's demands and leave the planet." Darien scowled at Kekoa for good measure. His crew—or Kekoa for that matter—didn't need to know he was staying willingly.

"But, Captain, we cannot leave you behind."

"I'm not asking you, Jacques. I'm giving you an order. Inform the Council they are not to send more expeditions to this wretched planet because next time there will be a massacre. We don't want an incident."

"What about you? All intergalactic laws abhor the taking of hostages."

"This _priest_ says he will let me go in sixty standard days. For now, we have no other option than to trust him."

"Captain, this is madness." Frederick shook his head.

"I gave you an order. See it through."

"Aye, aye, Captain." Both men disappeared after sharp nods.

"I didn't know you were the captain of the expedition."

Again, that amused tone.

"You never asked." Darien felt like blowing a raspberry in Kekoa's direction.

"True," Kekoa murmured. The smuggest grin decorated his insanely distracting face.

Back in the previous room, Darien observed the swift dismantling of his excavation area. His androids lay scattered like the abandoned corpses of a bloodless battle. Frederick and Jacques' team worked to retrieve them. "You're gonna pay for those androids," Darien hissed to disguise the anxiety possessing him with each passing second.

****

Kekoa chuckled. "I just discharged them. They are not damaged." He noticed the boy was restrained but twitchy. He was more than sure it wasn't the fact that his people were packing, but that he still had his virginity intact.

I will take care of that, but there's no reason to rush now.

He's all mine.

In reality, Kekoa didn't know how he'd summoned the control to avoid becoming all paws over that creamy, vestal body. He knew the boy was young, perhaps only a quarter of the average one hundred standard years humans lived. Almost exactly the equivalent of his well-enjoyed six hundred standard years.

Kekoa always thought humans were pretty; what he couldn't have foreseen was his mating to one of them. Even if he didn't have irrefutable proof yet that the boy was his mate, something in the way Darien scanned his body became an insanely potent pull. He put a hand over the young man's shoulder, doing his best not to squeeze it. "I'll take good care of you."

Darien looked his way with that sexy narrowed scowl of his. "If you think I'm going to stay here passively waiting for you to _take care of me_ , you're delusional." He paused, maybe trying to find the courage to say something else.

No, not the courage, this youngling didn't strike him as a coward. That, in turn, launched Kekoa's imagination into all sorts of _oh-so-not-passive_ scenarios, including his face burrowed between those round, delicious cheeks.

Darien interrupted Kekoa's swift machinations. "I want answers, I want details, and above all, I need to know the reasons why you hurry people away from this planet."

"Fair enough. By the way, you called me _bastard_. I know that word."

"It was for show." For the first time since being around Kekoa, Darien smirked.

All the former machinations rushed to Kekoa's loins, enhanced by the smug, handsome features. "It didn't sound like that. It was very convincing."

"The fact that I want to strangle you because you made me a hostage helped a lot." Darien grimaced, scrunching his nose.

If that didn't make Kekoa want to devour the human, he didn't know what would.

### CHAPTER FIVE

They watched the human spaceship leave the planet the next day. Colvis had very few hours of night, but since they were close to the core of the planet, it didn't make a difference. Kekoa learned during the second Cygnus Federation expedition that they'd named his home Planet XZ345. As if it was some random asteroid.

Kekoa didn't plan on letting Darien go back to his people, but perhaps it was time to let the galaxy know Colvis wasn't an abandoned, cursed planet. Mostly.

Sleeping arrangements had been awkward the previous night since Darien insisted on sleeping fully clothed. Kekoa only shrugged and started to undress, taking each garment off slower than necessary just to tease his charge. Darien did his best to remain unmoved but failed miserably, changing colors many times. They slept in a sixty-nine position, with Darien's booted feet at Kekoa's eye level.

I'm going to sixty-nine him soon enough.

Darien has no idea how patient I can be.

He will wake up one day so in love with me he won't be able to breathe.

Darien remained impassive as the ship disappeared into the atmosphere and then into open space. He turned to face Kekoa. "Show me where the food is coming from. I don't want to be eating an eight-headed thing."

"I'll do you one better. I'm going to give you a tour of your home for the next sixty standard days. What do you think?" Kekoa hoped—well, he was sure—by the end of that period Darien would never want to leave his side.

"Fifty-nine," Darien tossed, walking past him. "One day is already gone."

"Smart ass." Kekoa chuckled following Darien out of the control room. "Or is that something you don't say anymore either?"

"Ass is fine." Darien twirled and pointed an accusatory finger at him. "If you dare to say _my_ ass is fine, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble, _priest_."

"The truth should never be offensive." Kekoa shrugged and with a flourish showed the way with a toothy smile.

****

If he shrugs one more time like that, I'm gonna tear his clothes apart.

Darien warred with his horniness. He was a prisoner. He wasn't supposed to be lusting after his effing jailer, a hot as Nova jailer (as much as he wanted to scream the opposite), white hair and all.

They stopped at a balcony looming over an extensive vegetable garden where many androids, more humanoid looking than Darien's own, worked fervently. The greenery below them sent a pang of guilt by making him remember his brother's obnoxious but now sure-as-home green tea. It also forced him to realize the cinnamon and clove fragrance following him since he became a prisoner emanated from Kekoa.

"You're the only person here?" Darien asked, enraptured by the way the false light of the place played on Kekoa's pristine locks.

"I'm not alone anymore." Kekoa's cobalt eyes flashed mischievously.

"Pfft, my visit is but a speck in what is an insanely long existence if I accept you were here when my people came for the first time." Kekoa was imperturbable so Darien continued, "How do you cope?"

"You're either an enigma or don't know how to make up your mind. One minute you act with disdain and the following you're worried about my wellbeing." Kekoa removed a wandering curl from Darien's brow.

Darien's first instinct was to swat the hand away, and he did. "Hands off!" At Academy, guys were always trying to touch him. He had never had time for boys.

"No hands, then." Kekoa crushed Darien with his imposing frame. Hands caged him, posted on either side of the rail, pressing their chests together and locking their lips.

As much as the action had been forceful, the gentle mouth covering Darien's sent him to blissful places. His knees weakened, and he forgot how to gain oxygen; his lower back bent over the rail at an awkward but strangely pleasant angle. He clutched Kekoa's strong shoulders with both hands—perhaps for safety, perhaps because it felt like the right thing to do.

Infinite minutes later, Kekoa chuckled, breaking their kiss. "How can you be so soft and so hard at the same time?" He moved his hand to caress the burning hardness covered by Darien's pants.

Still dizzy, Darien was surprised when his snarky reflexes fired up. "It can get harder in tighter places."

"Is that so?" Kekoa's cobalt flames bored into him. "Tempting offer."

The white-haired man's breath caressed Darien's mouth, and a shiver ran through his whole body, aggravating him.

"You're just a monumental tease," Darien spat out. "I'm sure if I took off all my clothes, right here right now, you would leave me hard and hanging." He pushed Kekoa away and straightened himself, dusting nonexistent specks from his clothes, a scowl firmly in place.

"At risk of sounding ridiculous, I must tell you I want more than your body."

"Pfft, yeah, you do," Darien blurted, his hands like talons gripping the rail in a lame attempt to keep them off Kekoa.

"I do what, pretty one?" Kekoa looked believably clueless.

"Sound like a ridiculous poser. You don't need to promise love to get into my pants. I'm willing."

"That I see." Kekoa looked him up and down, zeroing in on his bulging crotch.

Darien's hands flew to the snaps of his pants, ready to let it all out.

Kekoa stopped him with an iron clasp on his left wrist. "Not right here, not right now. You're just upset because your crew departed. I don't want your first to be a hate fuck. As much as I enjoy it rough, that's not the way I envision it with you."

"So it has to be on your terms, when you choose?" Darien growled, seriously wanting to maul Kekoa.

"You can also choose the moment, but when you arrive at the appropriate mindset." Kekoa released his grip and held one of Darien's hands quietly, trying to intertwine their fingers.

"My mind doesn't need to be there." Darien snatched his hand away abruptly. Their fingers laced like that felt too good to let it happen. He just wanted to become a man, not to find a lover.

"What you're lacking is food." Kekoa nodded toward the living area. "Come on. Let's eat something."

Darien managed to growl and blow a raspberry at the same time, nicely finishing by sticking out his tongue. Once his erection subsided, his grumpy stomach took the reins of his body. He didn't have any other option than to follow Kekoa's perky ass toward the wafting aromas of their breakfast. This removed his imploding head from all the things he wanted in his mouth that were not necessarily food.

But those will give me nourishment nonetheless.

### CHAPTER SIX

For some reason I am not able to calculate, he wants me to feel something for him before he takes me. I don't want to feel anything. I've seen what relationships do to people. My parents are not happy. That's why Ben is a whore and I am an effing virgin. Even sappy Frederick and Jacques, I'm pretty sure all that honeyed façade is a monumental ruse, a candy-coated sham. I don't believe in Love.

But Darien couldn't deny how good it felt to discover the day in Kekoa's arms, the way those tender yet demanding kisses awakened every pore of his body. How perfectly their symmetries aligned when they spooned. Already ten days, and twenty of the one hundred starships guarding his heart had succumbed to that effing, older-than-dirt, purple _byotch_ guardian of the planet—Kekoa. At this rate, before the end of these ominous sixty standard days, Darien would be pliant and complacent, thinking of pink nebulas and Kardashian sunsets.

Alone in their bedroom (did he just think of this place as theirs? Jamming asteroids), learning Kekoa's language thanks to a linguistic helmet, Darien got distracted by the entrance of the head android coming to pick up their used garments. If they didn't all look exactly the same, he would have thought they were actual men. Beautiful naked men.

Whoever designed these androids paid too much attention to detail regarding round buttocks and perfect torsos, with wide shoulders and defined muscles. However, this architect crudely shattered the illusion by depriving these technological jewels of a potent cock. They seemed like little boys' action figures with their smooth, convex crotches, most likely to prevent their owners from using them as sexual toys.

Someone who didn't need external tools for sex was Kekoa. Darien had caught a holoconf with two nice-looking, white-haired guys truly disappointed because Kekoa was not going to be able to let them visit to entertain him. Kekoa had explained to Darien his entire race possessed white hair independent of age, but that many people colored it. Darien knew that little formative comment had been an ill-conceived trick to distract him from the fact that he'd walked into their carnal conspiracy. As corny as it might be, Darien felt a pang of jealousy for their intimacy.

Maybe if Kekoa just used him from Nova and back, Darien wouldn't be developing this imploding attachment to his jailer. He forced himself to remember that even if his sentence had a timeframe; it was still curtailing his freedom.

Darien was ready to give his body, but his heart?

Nuh-uh.

He would not allow that silly thing to spread its legs and be mastered. He would go on the offensive instead of waiting for an attack.

I'm going to seduce the effing Guardian.

****

"What are you plotting, Fire Curls?" Kekoa noticed he'd startled Darien upon entering their bedroom. That sexy scowl of his welcomed him. So cute.

"Brooding over not having any poison to get rid of you," Darien spat, narrow-eyed and teeth-bared.

"Easy, meteor, I thought we were beyond poisoning." Kekoa chuckled inwardly. Since sniffing Darien was his favorite pastime, he'd learned what a _dog_ was; also that many times they were all bark and no bite. Darien was such a lovely puppy, of the curly kind. "You might miss being the little spoon."

"I think you're inhaling more than just me. Don't look at me that way. I've caught you with your nose near me when you think I'm asleep. What is it, Caelum Powder or Vulpecula dust?"

Kekoa laughed aloud. Life with this human would always be interesting. "The only things I inhale are Frizzy Red and D-skin."

Darien grimaced. "Very funny." He sobered up. "I know you go to the temples on the surface. When do you plan on taking me with you?"

"I go there for ritualistic purposes. It never crossed my mind you might be interested." An honest mistake, but a mistake nonetheless, Kekoa should have offered first. "I'll go again in two standard days. You're welcome to join me."

"So, when we were excavating we prevented you from doing these rituals?" Darien seemed seriously concerned, which gave him an even more adorable countenance.

"Not at all. The season started after your people left." Kekoa sat on the bed close to Darien's legs.

"Good," Darien offered with a nod. "Do you mind if I organize our supper today? I want to apologize for my _poison_ comment. You've been nothing but kind to me all this time. I guess I just need to be patient."

"Of course not. I'll be delighted to discover what you're planning for us." Kekoa stood up and went to the intercom on the wall.

The head android answered immediately. "Yes, master?"

"Darien will select the dishes for tonight's dinner. Please follow his instructions closely. He has carte blanche to even cook if he chooses to." Kekoa did this with the precise intention of seeing if Darien would take the challenge. The android acknowledged his orders, and Kekoa finished the conversation with the biggest smile plastered on his face. "You cook, right?"

"If you want me to act like a househusband, the least you could do is have sex with me, don't you think?" Darien blurted, little growls dotting his words.

"We could go back to what was programmed." Kekoa shrugged, knowing how much that irked Darien. "An apology is absolutely unnecessary for your comment. I'm not offended, and I don't feel threatened." He winked to put the final splash of mischievousness into his demeanor as he walked back to the bed.

Darien sprang from the bed, almost as if he were escaping from Kekoa's proximity, his eyes mere slits. "I'm going to the kitchen." He stormed out of the room.

Maybe Darien hadn't realized it, but they'd just had all this entertaining exchange in Kekoa's own language. His mate was a fast learner.

He is on his way.

### CHAPTER SEVEN

"Everything was excellent, Darien. You surpassed my expectations. I must admit it was just a game to get at you, but you beat me without effort."

More than an apology, Darien's actions seemed like the celebration of a special occasion. He'd even dressed up and acted uncharacteristically amicable during the entire affair. The loose golden shirt contrasted beautifully with his pale skin and brought a wicked shine to his wonderful eyes. The dark pants and knee boots made him seem fit to be adored by the Royal Court. It was a shame they would never be able to attend such functions together.

This was also the first time Darien had accepted aged liquor from him. For some reason Kekoa didn't want to analyze, the action appeared appropriate for the atmosphere surrounding them tonight.

"My pleasure. I realized I've been an obtuse whiner. This situation could be a lot worse." Darien sipped from his goblet with a faint smile. "I promise I'll be less hostile from now on."

Kekoa noted Darien didn't use the word _friendly_. "By all means, behave as you consider best."

"Thank you." Darien blew a couple of curls from his forehead. "I don't know if it's this liquor, but it feels hot in here." His free hand undid buttons, revealing creamy pectorals.

"You'll get used to it."

"I want you to do something, but you have to promise you will, before I ask." The cheeky smirk was teasing.

"Anything you want but your departure from this planet."

"I watched something once, and it would be interesting to try it with you." Darien stood up, leaving his goblet on the table next to him. "Stay there until I tell you otherwise."

The golden shirt became a drapery hanging from a corner of the settee like a discarded memory. Supple muscles shone with the tenuous light they'd chosen for their after dinner conversation, and Kekoa knew in that moment he was in big trouble. He started to say something, and Darien cut him off with a leveled, "You promised."

The fastenings of his pants came undone, and Kekoa's redheaded mate was already half hard. Kekoa made a silent vow to do his best not to fuck Darien. Not tonight, not yet.

The worst kind of punishment is to resist temptation.

Darien picked up his goblet, swirling its contents, never breaking eye contact. Working with steady strokes on his cock, he drank some liquor. Agate jewels flashed mischievously as he lowered the drinking vessel and sent Kekoa's mind scattering around the galaxies by dipping his unsheathed cockhead into the cerise liquid.

"I wonder if this would have a different flavor sampled from here." A single drop ran along the shaft as Darien released the curved beast and motioned with a crooked finger toward Kekoa to verify his guess.

Kekoa's reticence met taunting.

"Oh great warrior, wielder of the curse, supreme priest, are you afraid if you taste it, you might become my slave and the roles would be reversed?" Darien's innocent face as he lazily stroked his cock was devastating.

Tearing off his shirt, Kekoa pounced and landed on his knees in front of Darien, ravenous. Temptation was a harsh mistress, and he was very, very weak against her demands. Besides, what could be better than being slave to your own mate?

Darien caressed Kekoa's chin, pulling it softly toward his dripping helmet. When he spoke, his voice came out gentle, soothing. "Yours."

So many days wanting to do this, and suddenly, it was all there without his bidding. If he was imagining the whole thing, he didn't want to snap from his delusion. The liquor tasted like nectar mingled with Darien's fluids. His body trembled, recognizing the essence of his mate, the tang that would guide him for the rest of his life.

His whole being tingled with keen need as more and more of Darien's formidable weapon mastered his mouth. The moment his throat muscles closed around the swollen head, Kekoa lost his last vestige of reserve. His spine arched, wanting to be commanded in both ends, Darien's hands raking his hair and driving him crazy.

Bleary vision was his reward every time he reached the base with his lips and the flames of Darien's lower curls welcomed his prowess. Kekoa's cock was a fountain fed by Darien's whimpers and moans. Unable to stop himself, Kekoa scooped his precum with avid fingers and reached for his hole, mitigating somehow the turmoil in his rear. Molten heat ran rampant within his core.

One digit wasn't enough, and as Kekoa added another.

Darien's voice came out strangled, lost. "What are you doing?"

Full of cock as he was, Kekoa tried to answer with his eyes and a slight shrug of his shoulders, but the questioning and desire he found in the agate jewels compelled him to voice his urgency. "I need both holes met."

Tilting his body, Darien tried to see the fingering pistons, but as Kekoa was a lot taller than he was, there was only one solution. "Lie on your back."

Kekoa didn't want to lose the width assaulting his mouth, but a word from his mate rang like a command, so he reluctantly let go with a slow, torturous slide. Unable to break eye contact, he shifted his body, shoulders planted on the floor and legs held to his chest to give Darien a better view.

Darien nodded, silently ordering him to resume his task to mitigate the explosive craving of his entrance. Kekoa gathered more precum. Thank Meha for the powerful lubricant their fluids were.

Three became four, and the raging hunger Kekoa discovered in Darien's eyes could only be conquered one way. "Fuck me." More lubricant found its way to his hole with dabbing motions, and Kekoa spread his legs further, hunching upward, offering completion. Their eyes imperturbably locked. "Please."

Languid strokes accompanied Darien's unsteady breathing. The red-headed man who was about to stop being a virgin didn't look hesitant but humbled, as if Kekoa was giving him something bigger than anything he'd received before. All his cockiness and mischief melted into sudden devotion. He uttered calmly, "Yes."

With perfect aim, Darien breached Kekoa's tormented gate, dissolving Kekoa's cells in blinding bliss. As Darien's pace increased, Kekoa's legs draped about Darien's hips, arching his body into the perfect angle for their mouths to dance. A scorching tongue parried with Kekoa's in a lethal choreography designed to make him lose the remnants of his consciousness. Kekoa murmured into Darien's mouth, the sweetest agony reigning over him. "Mine."

Kekoa swam in Darien's hazel lakes—minutes, hours, days of seductive invasion—robbing him of his senses. He hissed, "I won't break. Harder."

Wet red curls swayed as Darien began the ramming Kekoa's body needed now that the tenderness of the discovery had turned into full, destructive battering. Kekoa wanted to end up dismembered, devastated, scattered.

### CHAPTER EIGHT

I always thought I'd be the one covered by another man.

By the Seven Planets, I'm losing it on Planet X!

The clouds adorning Kekoa's head shimmered in the subdued light enveloping them, and contrasted with the burgundy and golden hues of the rug where the Guardian lay, enraptured. On his back but in no way motionless, Kekoa embraced the pounding with resolute intensity and ardor, shattering all of Darien's inane concepts of age and beauty.

"You feel incredible around my cock," Darien announced, breathing haphazardly.

Kekoa met his assault with renewed intensity. "As you do inside me."

The particle in the back of his mind screaming that this was his enemy and what he was doing was absolutely wrong drowned in the flood of sweltering passion laced with infinite gratitude. His squashed pride wanted to remain stoic, telling him he'd seduced his foe, but deep in the sacred vault of his heart, a little flame shone brighter by the second. Darien had been the one conquered, and he went head-on to accept his defeat.

Eighty starships had plummeted, like a meteor rain, leaving his heart unguarded for the taking. With each thrust, the closer he came to his orgasm, the more he realized Kekoa hadn't kept him as a mere hostage. Another thing existed, but in this instant, as his body prepared to surrender in annihilating ecstasy, as he peered into the mesmerizing abyss, he did not care.

Cobalt suns scorched him as his body became a trillion fleeing atoms; the substance of things surrounding them changed into translucent energy, feathery whispers, irrevocable freedom.

The condensation of his matter and the clench of the muscles milking the last drops of his climax brought a new wave of delight, and Darien found his voice. "What in the Seven Planets was that?"

Kekoa smiled, sated, radiant and drenched in his own aftermath. Like a single word, he hissed, "A certainty."

Darien nodded without a complete grasp of the intention or meaning of that response and rested his head on Kekoa's chest, unaffected by the mess and ready to drift.

Armed with his newly found freedom, Darien became the big spoon on their immense bed, commanding the white-haired warrior's body more than once that night.

****

Since he'd been unconscious during his first teleportation, Darien stood dizzily in the atrium of the temple, trying to gather his bearings. He didn't recognize this area but was intimately sure none of the previous expeditions had come this deep within the complexes. While everything on the outside of the monuments looked well preserved but ancient, wherever he was right now seemed polished and maintained as if in constant use.

They brought with them flowers, fruits and a medium-size cage with a lizard-like, otherworldly creature covered in blue-jeweled scales, reminding Darien of the feathers of a peacock.

Breathtaking in a pristine silver ensemble, with a top similar to chainmail and his muscular legs covered by a material that seemed at once metallic and flexible, Kekoa disturbingly looked the part of the warrior priest he was. His equally platinum boots resounded on the vast expanse with deadly echoes.

"Have you ever killed anything?" Kekoa gave Darien a sideways glance as they walked toward the imposing statue of Meha. The feminine representation was at least ten times Kekoa's height, which was already large.

Darien felt for some unexplained reason empowered by his similar outfit, the only difference his was pure white. "As in another person?"

Kekoa murmured, his eyes still forward, "Not necessarily. Any living creature."

"Yes. We used to hunt on one of the forest moons of Varax." Well, he didn't know if Kekoa knew where Varax was, but that was the answer.

"Good, then you won't be grossed out by what I'm about to do." This time Kekoa faced him with a wicked grin. "Some people don't mind killing other people but get squeamish when it's other creatures."

"I know. It doesn't make sense. I think the logical reaction should be to have reservations about killing your own kind."

"In some individuals it becomes an acquired taste," Kekoa uttered cryptically.

Before Darien could ask the meaning of those words, Kekoa stopped them close to the enormous pedestal and, with a finger over his lips, silenced him. Speaking in an incomprehensible language, Kekoa moved his hands as a prestidigitator would, summoning chunks of the walls at either side of them.

The blocks flew toward the space between them and the base of the giant statue, neatly forming an altar. From the monolithic foundation under Meha, something similar to a bowl emanated, landing on the center of the recently formed altar. As if it had always been part of it.

"What you're about to do is a great honor. One I share with you immersed in infinite gratefulness." Kekoa bent a little and kissed the top of Darien's head. "I'm glad you are here."

Hands busy with flowers and fruits, Darien had to repress the now natural motion of pulling Kekoa into his arms. Resigned, he uttered, "Me too." He felt silly instantly because that could have meant he was happy that Kekoa was glad or that he was happy because he was there. He wanted to kick himself for being inarticulate at the worst possible moments.

Kekoa smiled at him, perhaps reading his inner tirade or simply enjoying his company in this sacred place.

Grr. This is the most stupid moment to have an argument with myself.

"Place your offerings on the altar and display them inside the _boule_ , first the fruits and then sprinkle the flowers over them." Kekoa traced one hand up and down Darien's back, soothing and encouraging at once. "Take your time and think about her."

Darien worked on his oblation, remembering the exchange they had the previous night.

"She was the goddess of passion and turmoil who evolved into the goddess of war."

"That doesn't make any sense."

"Don't we all fight for love at some point in our lives? It makes sense that passion and war became one and the same in the minds of our ancestors. Her presence lingers here. This is her planet. That is why we can't completely abandon or destroy it.

"Legend says that in a ritualistic love-making obeisance for the goddess, General Kaweh discovered the five points to destroy an enemy inspired by the goddess' wisdom. Your orifices, your senses, your limbs, your head, your heart. Thus, the five temples were created to develop the knowledge to defeat our enemies. This happened when the planet where your people originated from was still covered in lava and newborn, millions of years ago.

"That is why your people or any other should not explore here. The information contained in these abandoned buildings can be used to conquer entire galaxies easily."

Darien finished. The composition was lovely, and aside from the recall of their conversation, he felt a gentle pull toward the presence surrounding them, dotting his intention with the desire to please Meha.

Kekoa put his hand over Darien's right shoulder. "It's perfect." Slowly threading along his shoulder and arm, Kekoa held his hand and pulled him a step behind. Once again, in that incomprehensible but melodic language, Kekoa waved his hands, still holding Darien's. A murmur (like wind zigzagging through many corridors) encompassed them, and Darien followed Kekoa's line of vision upward. A dagger emerged from the breast of the goddess and descended in a surprisingly straight line in their direction. It quietly landed on Darien's open palm still held by Kekoa.

With his other hand, Kekoa pronounced more incantations, and the cage released the jeweled beast. It floated until centered upon the _boule_ containing Darien's offering. Fingers intertwined, their hands closed on the hilt of the dagger; they sliced the lizard-like sacrifice together. A liquid as transparent as crystalline water escaped from the wound, dripping over flowers and fruits, and making them crackle as if an inner fire consumed them.

"We give you the blood of a creature of the earth so you don't ask for ours, Mother, Queen, Owner," Kekoa said in his native language, Colviri; a tongue that had come easily to Darien.

Darien remained speechless as the lizardesque animal settled over the other contents of the sacrificial bowl, and the entire oblation disintegrated inwardly, as if devoured by a black hole. A continuous crackling sound accompanied the vanishing, and the aroma of sunny valleys surrounded them.

Hands still laced, they lifted their arms, releasing the dagger, which ascended in the same uncannily straight manner to the breast of the goddess, doing a one hundred and eighty degree rotation to disappear as it had appeared.

Every pore of his body hummed, and Darien felt elated, renewed—as if what he'd just witnessed could clarify all the queries his soul had been harboring unbeknown to him.

Kekoa chanted again, never losing the hold on Darien's hand. The _boule_ returned to the pedestal, and the altar disassembled, its parts returning to the temple's walls.

They'd done all this standing side by side, and now, Kekoa turned to face Darien with his entire body, holding both hands in his. Flashing cobalt eyes and sunrise-colored lips smirking with delight greeted Darien. "It would be a nice offering to make love at her feet."

The whirlpool swallowing Darien became a groaned, "Yes."

### CHAPTER NINE

Kekoa undressed Darien with the same reverence he'd just used to offer a sacrifice to his deity. A presence Darien sensed thrumming within him as if he had adored her his whole life.

Once both were naked, Kekoa covered every part of him with wet kisses, stopping to bestow special emphasis on his more tender and sensitive areas. Kekoa's hair trailed behind every kiss, enhancing the marvelous sensations. When Darien rested on his stomach and Kekoa finally kissed him between his cheeks with a playful lick into his hole, he knew what he really ought to offer.

Darien arched his body seeking the Guardian's face. Confused for a moment, Kekoa peered at him. Darien nodded, turning his body again to rest on his back and pulling Kekoa between his legs. "I need you inside me. I want to give this up at her feet. I feel it means something for you, for me, for her. I still don't know what, but I'm positive it's the right thing to do."

"Our union is sacred. With each passing second, it is dawning on you more clearly. I can promise you eternal love, my mate. You just have to accept it."

Darien relished the thickness of Kekoa's cock nestled between his cheeks, spreading, teasing, leaking. "Is that what I'm feeling? That we're mates and meant to be together."

"Yes." Kekoa kissed him, biting Darien's lower lip softly and laughing as Darien wrapped his legs around him.

****

"There are no such things as coincidences," Kekoa told Darien, his chest ready to explode. His mate made an offering with him to his goddess, and she'd received it with open arms. Now, his explorer was about to give an even bigger oblation: his manhood. "With this we become equals, as one."

"What I want exactly. Completely yours, completely mine." Darien's deep voice caressed him. His once vestal fragrance had turned into the piquant rumble of a sandstorm.

Kekoa kissed his mate again and traveled south, marking the way with licks and more kisses, until he took Darien's cock in his mouth. Darien groaned and writhed happily, thrusting upward, desperate to give him more. Kekoa settled Darien comfortably over his lap. With one hand, he controlled the rigid cock massaging his lips and used the other to tease the still virgin cavity. His abundant fluids provided the perfect lubrication for the debut about to happen.

Fiery curls swayed, and Darien grunted, "I cannot take this anymore. What are you waiting for?"

"Say it," Kekoa chuckled, letting his cockhead breach the tight ring just a little more.

"Sodding imploding _byotch_! Please, Kekoa, fuck me from here to Nova and back!"

The potent order activated every atom of his being. "Aye, aye, my Captain." And, thus, Kekoa spiraled with his mate to the place where Oblivion and Bliss are entwined lovers.

Darien moaned and groaned an incoherent litany; just a few words made sense to Kekoa. "Good... hard... mercy... forever."

Minutes or eons later, Kekoa's body froze as Darien screamed his orgasm, twisting Kekoa's cock with an intimate, muscled fist. Then Kekoa exploded, inundating his mate, white flashes blurring his vision. The solid walls of the temple vibrated with his own cry.

Kekoa crumbled over Darien, exhausted and sated like never before in his six hundred years. Not even two simultaneous lovers had given him this ecstatic relief. The swirling energy signaling the union with his mate enveloped them. He rolled, pulling Darien with him and cradling the red head in his arms, the disheveled curls tickling his chin.

On the verge of sailing to the land of dreams, Kekoa opened his eyes to give silent thanks to Meha.

He could have sworn he saw the goddess smiling.

### CHAPTER TEN

The sixty-first day found them immersed in an idyllic trance. If a smidge of doubt had ever tried to dampen Darien's happiness, Kekoa's truthful kisses quickly chased it away. Darien prayed deep in his heart his family had given him up for dead and never tried to come back to Colvis.

Being a son of a consul of the Federation, that hope was pure wishful thinking.

"Masters, a starship of the Cygnus Federation is hailing us." The voice of the head android hovered over their tangled limbs.

Kekoa pulled Darien's now shoulder-length hair playfully. "Is it that day already?"

"Ouch." Darien swatted Kekoa in an equally child-like manner. He sighed. "I was dreading this moment."

"Send a confusion signal. That would give us time to be presentable," Kekoa ordered.

"Yes, master."

They dressed for war.

****

Ben's scowl welcomed them. "Release my brother, you bastard." He could not see them holding hands out of the screen's range. Good thing this wasn't a holoconf.

"Your brother is not a prisoner."

"I want to hear it from him," Ben spat, visibly offended. Fumes literally rose from his head.

"Ben, this is my home now. We're mated." Darien gave his brother a _don't you dare contradict me_ face.

"Jamming asteroids, Darien. What is this _mated_ nonsense? He's not even human!" Ben growled, frustrated. "What have you been inhaling?" He flailed his arms. "This is not normal. He has white hair, and you loathe that!"

"Stop it. Turn around and let me be. We don't have to forget each other, but this is my place now." It hurt, but it would hurt more to lose Kekoa.

Ben sighed, his entire demeanor changing. "I didn't want to resort to this, but you leave me no other option." He punched several controls on the panel in front of him. A hologram of Consul Muselet, their father, appeared.

"Captain Darien Muselet, this is not a request but a direct order of the Cygnus Federation Council. You're to board Admiral Muselet's starship immediately, or we declare war on the individual holding you on Planet XZ345. The admiral has the complete fleet at his disposal to proceed in whichever manner he deems necessary."

Darien shook his head. Kekoa's hand stroked his lower back, soothing him.

"Please, little brother, don't do this," Ben pleaded. Darien knew that either way their relationship would never be the same again.

"Give me a moment, Ben." Darien held his hand up, then blurred the screen by punching a key. He turned to his mate. "We have the power to conquer galaxies on this planet, right?"

"Yes." Kekoa nodded.

"We can take the entire Federation Fleet down, right?"

"Yes." Kekoa hugged him. "But that doesn't mean they would not keep coming."

"I feel my duty is to you and Meha. You're my family now," Darien murmured, squeezing Kekoa.

"Whatever decision you make, I'll stand by you." Kekoa kissed Darien's nose, ruffling his hair.

"I cannot let them destroy this planet. I promise I'll come back." Tears fought to surface, but Darien stood his ground.

"I know you will. We will be together again." This time Kekoa covered his mouth, letting him know how much he needed him, how much he would miss Darien.

"This is to save our home," Darien said it more to convince himself than Kekoa. He cleared the screen, aiming for nonchalant but failing miserably. "Send an effing transport to pick me up, you whore."

Eons ago, I thought hara-kiri would be my worst outcome.

Ben simply nodded with the saddest smile Darien had ever seen before.

****

They teleported to the surface, holding hands until his transport arrived.

Their lips met and locked in a kiss to last Darien a lifetime, enough to keep him going until he was able to return. "Kekoa Wana'ao, you're my mate, and I will fight until my last breath to be by your side again. This I promise. Take care of our home," he said in Colviri.

Kekoa smiled with bright eyes, the dry wind of Colvis disheveling his hair. "Darien Muselet, you're my mate, and nothing in this universe could stop us from being together and happy again. This I promise. Your home will wait for you."

Darien caressed the white hair he had learned to love so much, allowing Kekoa to ruffle his fiery locks one more time. He turned and began walking toward the transport's gate.

The last words Darien heard from Kekoa's lips were "Truly, a heart of gold."

KEKOA

PLANET COLVIS

"Pan Kekoa, we're at your service."

"Tyke, Sun, your mission remains the same. Stay close to Darien and keep him out of harm's way."

"We received the coordinates you sent. We're on our way to encounter the rescue mission and follow them to Nova Gaia."

"I must stress again that he's not to know of your presence unless it's absolutely necessary. He'll be really pissed off if he learns I'm doing this."

Sun's bright eyes flashed with mischief. "But, our pan, wouldn't it be better if he were aware? Wouldn't he cooperate?"

"My mate is too proud. I'm not sure he'd even accept direct help from me if he has the means to resolve the issue on his own. No. Stay hidden unless his life is in peril."

"Very well, our pan." Tyke smiled. "If possible, one of us will board his ship in disguise. If not the tracker you put in him will keep us alert of his every move and vitals within the vessel. We can teleport the instant our help is needed."

"Good. Both our lives are in your hands because I won't be able to survive without him."

"It's our most ardent wish that you have a long life with your mate, our pan."

"I thank you for that. It's not our decision to be separated, but we'll find a way. I just have a really bad feeling about this particular mission. He has been all over the galaxy since his departure, but this time... I don't know how to put it into words."

"We have faith in Meha that we'll be there for him if anything goes awry."

"Let's hope it doesn't come to that and I'm just being unnecessarily paranoid. Keep me informed."

"Yes, pan." Both men bowed in perfect synchrony as if they were one, and their image dissipated.

And to think that before Darien entered Kekoa's life, that uncanny way of moving in unison was an absolute turn on— now, it was simply amusing.

Full of that unsettling sensation churning inside him for days, Kekoa made another call.

"Why, the Guardian himself. What a pleasant surprise!" General Ur beamed.

"How are you?"

"Same old, same old. What about you? You don't look all there."

"I need you to go to the Oracle on my behalf."

"What? What's wrong?" Ur's face instantly turned serious.

"I'm not sure. Darien is going on a rescue mission to a planet called Nova Gaia in the Mobiri sector. They had a plague about five years ago, and it's taken until now for their Cygnus Federation to resolve to send help."

"And you're worried Darien might get infected?"

"No. It's not even that. The population was decimated, but the planet is a hundred percent safe to live on currently. I think the evacuation at this stage is more psychological than actually needed. Just to remove the survivors from the tragedy."

"I see. Then, what is it?"

"I can't name it. It's this disturbing impression that something is gonna go terribly wrong, and he'll die or something."

There were worse things than death but those differed from person to person: enslavement, disabilities, losing of one's wealth. His grandfather once said that people living without love were worse than dead.

"What could be worse than death?"

"Ur, you know there are worse things than dying. You, of all people, shouldn't ask such a silly question."

"Those were extraordinary circumstances."

"Everything that happens twice is ought to happen a third time, even if it's eons apart."

"You're right. I'll get in touch with the priests as soon as we end this conversation." Ur hesitated for a moment, then spoke, "May I ask why you're not communing with the goddess directly?"

"I don't think I can summon the peace to do it."

"I understand. I'll get to it posthaste."

"Please. He'll be on that planet in less than thirty-six standard hours."

"The priests will not delay on a request from the Guardian."

"Well, this Guardian is going nuts!"

"I'll be back with an answer sooner than you can say _floccinaucinihilipilification_."

Ur was his commanding officer, but Kekoa blurted, his eyes wide like exploding planets, hands pulling his hair and shaking his head "Are you shitting me? That's a very fucking long word!"

"But I made you smile, didn't I?"

"Bared teeth are not a smile!"

"Guardian, have faith. Meha will not let your mate be lost."

"Faith I have. What I don't have is patience for the unknown."

ALARIC

RESCUE STARSHIP HALCYON'S PEACE

Their fellow survivors were dispersed in clusters about the immense mess hall. The _liquid_ meals were scheduled in three turns; theirs was the middle one, and they had missed almost half of their allotted time. The line to retrieve the transparent pouches was relatively short since most people were already sitting and conversing in hushed tones.

Living in a desolated place had left most of them standoffish, minding their own business, and seeking the minimal human contact possible. Apparently, the change of environment had mitigated that somewhat, but the current residents of the _Halcyon's Peace_ weren't as animated as Alaric remembered people could be when reunited in large quantities. Well, this was only day two on the ship after all. The Nova Gaians would come around. They had been happy people, and they would be that again somehow.

Alaric looked around for a group to settle with and found that the most spirited was the one surrounding the little old lady who told him about the rescue as the column of survivors marched toward the rescue point. She appeared to be relating a very interesting story because those encircling her not only looked enraptured but _Oh-ed_ and giggled with her every word. He pointed at them. "Let's sit there, seems like a very fun group."

Sule shook his head and trailed after him.

In the middle of a dramatic pause, while the others had their eyes like plates, Alaric sidled toward her and bowed when her sight rest on him. "Your blessing, mother."

She smiled. "The ancestors' and my blessings, boy" Her whole wrinkled face illuminated. "Oh, I remember you. Glad you made it, sweet boy. Who's you friend?" If possible she beamed more, eyeing their joined hands.

"This is Sule Sarong, mother." Alaric let go of Sule's hand, and Sule bowed to the lady. "But where are my manners, my name is Alaric Aquinas!"

Her laughter was girly and pleasant as she nodded. "I'm Margarite. Just Margarite." She laughed more.

"Like the mineral," Sule offered. Nova Gaia had large deposits of the pink rock and used it in everything from construction and drilling to electronic components.

"Well, it also meant 'pearl' in one ancient Terran language. I need to go back to my story since I'm seeing a lot of disappointed faces." She giggled musically.

Many of the twelve or so faces ranged from mild annoyance to exasperation to impatience, but there were two or three— frankly hostile. Margarite picked up her story. A cow had fallen from a cliff after being tricked by a wolf hoping to eat her, but she fell right in the middle of some people in a circle chanting and praying for a sign, and then they didn't know whether to eat or worship her. It wasn't the story (which was funny enough), but the way Margarite related it. She made faces and changed voices, moving her hands and body comically.

Two stories later, Sule and Alaric said their good-byes, promising to arrive earlier the next day to join her. They disposed of their nutrafluids pouches and exited the hall, Alaric following Sule. The uniform trousers were practical and obviously not tailored, having been made for thousands of people; yet, they encased Sule's derriere deliciously, and Alaric couldn't wait to be back in their compartment and bury his face between those cheeks. Now that they were finally together, Alaric seemed unable to be separated from Sule's body.

They were on their way to two hours of Telluran Government Instruction and, after a break, two more of Telluran Geography. Good thing they didn't have to learn a new language; those were not easy on Alaric.

Luckily, time flew by, and, once again, Alaric walked behind Sule after all their lessons, appreciating the way those lean, hard muscles moved in his uniform en route to their quarters, when a nasty gravelly voice made him look away from his target.

"We meet again, pretty boy."

Oh shit.

"The handsome lad has a name. If I recall correctly I already kicked your sorry asses once. Wanna revisit that memory?" Sule shielded Alaric with his body.

"Now, now, we're all gentlemen here."

"I don't think you were ever one," Sule growled.

"You weren't so aggressive on your knees servicing us."

"A finished transaction. I was repaying you for bringing meat from the mountains. There was no coercion involved. I was willing."

"So what's your point?" said the ugly, apparent leader of the group.

"You weren't exchanging anything with him, just taking by force. That I would not allow. Not then and not now."

Exactly. Alaric had also traded sexual favors with this lot in exchange for game. There was no use for money on Nova Gaia after the dust plague; it all became barter. Nevertheless, one thing was consent, and another abuse and rape.

"C'mon, winter eyes, we refugees need to share."

"Like Hell," grunted Alaric, pushing Sule aside. "You and your ratty-ass band of leeches will get luckier licking latrines than getting a piece of me."

"We will see about that, pretty boy. I always get my prey in the end."

The goon wasn't ready for Alaric's jab.

"Son of a bitch, you'll pay for this." The moron rubbed his face.

"I'll gladly pay with credits from the same place that one came from," Alaric hissed still in a fighting stance.

Spitting blood, the goon turned tail with his gang trailing behind him.

"Where did you learn to hit like that? That's not a Depot move."

"Berserk remember? Last time they caught me by surprise. As long as my hands are free I can dish a good punch. We weren't friends, but I expected them to have an iota of honor at least."

"Let's hope they keep it gentlemanly. Nonetheless, a fragger is never a bad accessory. We shall talk to the captain about this since we're not allowed to carry weapons."

"I'm pretty sure those idiots could find a way to procure some if they wanted. We cannot let them have the upper hand."

Sule caressed Alaric's cheek. "Alaric _Berserk_ Aquinas, you need to breathe." He chuckled a little.

Alaric smiled and winked, he would not let those fuckers distract him from enjoying his man. "Let's go. I've plans for you."

**Thanks for reading this teaser. Cheers!
