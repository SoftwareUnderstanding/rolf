**Introduction**

I've been interested in the spiritual and metaphysical since before I knew those words. I had an out of body experience during a near drowning when I was three years old and had at least two more before I was five years old. Each time I found myself outside my body, I felt safe and completely surrounded in love and the light of the Divine.

When I was eleven years old, my great-grandmother appeared to me in a dream. I found out late the next day that she'd died. I've had several other encounters since, so I'm undeniably biased.

In my teens I started working with energy and doing readings for my friends; now in my 50s I enjoy doing readings for others, healing and energy work, and astral exploration. I know that physical reality isn't all there is.

A few months ago when I was doing astral work, I felt called to collect stories of after death encounters and angelic encounters. I promptly asked the people I'd done readings for, fans of my page, and everyone else from friends to acquaintances if they'd like to contribute their own accounts. I'm grateful for and feel blessed by the generosity of everyone who responded. Thank you all!

For privacy's sake contributors are identified by their initials, their first name and last initial, or just their first name. There were two cases where someone had the same initials as a previous submitter, so they chose another set.

Each person has assured me that their encounter happened just as related to either themselves or a family member.

Being called to write this book has been another fascinating step down the path I've been on all my life. My mother was a career RN with an interest in helping those faced with death. By the time I was in my early 20s, we had an entire bookshelf devoted to the topic, including the works of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. My mother and I both enjoyed reading about reincarnation, out of body experiences, and visits from the dead; while I preferred collections of stories, my mother was most partial to research studies.

Besides the works of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, I've enjoyed the books of Raymond Moody, MD, Robert A. Monroe, Kenneth Ring, Bernie Siegel, Brian Weiss, MD, and Ian Wilson. I've also enjoyed articles in Omega: Journal of Death and Dying and several articles from different hospice organizations.

I've edited most of the stories that have been entrusted to me very minimally; one story isn't edited at all but has been treated as a historical document to be transcribed. I've standardized spelling and edited for clarity where needed, but I've purposefully done my best to keep each person's narrative voice intact rather than standardizing their grammar or changing their speech to "proper English." Not all the submissions were from people who speak American English, so you'll see some phrasing that reflects that.

I've always enjoyed hearing other people's experiences and found it very meaningful and joyful; I hope this book will bring the same joy to those who read it.

**Chapter 1**

Encounters with the dead are nothing new; accounts of deceased people or animals appearing to the living seem universal across cultures.

A 1971 survey in Wales by Dr. W.D. Rees showed 50% of widowers and 46% of widows reporting they'd had waking experiences where they perceived their deceased spouse. A national survey in Iceland in 1988 by E. Haraldsson showed 31% of survey respondents had perceived the presence of a deceased person. Andrew Greeley reported in 1989 that 42% of Americans had felt at least once in their life that they were in touch with someone who had died.

Several studies have indicated that those who report encounters with the dead seem more at peace with their loss and happier in general than those who don't have comparable experiences. No studies that I've found have showed any correlation between after death encounters and increased grief or mental disorders.

While there's still some tendency to dismiss such experiences as "grief hallucinations" or wishful thinking, it's changing. I'm grateful that as the subject is studied, there's increasing awareness among the public and within the health care community that these encounters can't and shouldn't be dismissed; that rather than being a sign of psychological stress or an unbalanced mind, they often provide comfort and may relay needed information. It's also increasingly apparent that while they do happen to people who are grieving, they also happen to those who aren't grieving, including those who didn't know the deceased or who don't know their loved one is dead.

**Chapter 2: What Are After Death Encounters?**

After death encounters are, simply put, any sort of interaction or experience with a person or animal who's dead. After death encounters are extremely varied in their presentation and can happen during waking, dreaming, and twilight states.

They can be physical: these include experiences involving the senses of sight, touch, smell, and hearing; encountering a deceased person or animal who is apparently solid and alive; and experiences with electrical appliances or electronics.

Visual encounters include experiences like seeing a chair rocking or door or window opening or closing by themselves and finding meaningful items moved around with no physical explanation.

Tactile encounters include things like as feeling a hug, a kiss, a pat on the back, a hand clasp, or the cold nose of a pet or the weight of its body against yours.

Olfactory encounters are the perception of a familiar odor or fragrance associated with the deceased, such as aftershave, perfume, cigarette smoke, flowers, or food smells.

Auditory encounters include things like hearing the audible voice of the deceased, the familiar creak of a rocking chair, the jingle of keys, the purr of a cat, or the click of a dog's nails on the floor.

Physical encounters can also include interacting with an apparently solid, physical, living being that one may or may not know is dead, as T.B. did.

After death encounters can also be non-physical. These include sensing or feeling the presence of a deceased person or animal; perceiving the deceased's voice in one's mind, experiencing a meaningful synchronicity about a person or animal; dreaming of the deceased; someone near death talking with those who've already died or stating that they're present.

Other encounters are protective interventions to help the living, like the stories from T. B., J.S., and L.T.

Some encounters are clearly farewells, like L.R., E.B., and J.F.'s. Sometimes the encounters pass on information that hadn't been passed on in life, as in the story from C.L.

Many encounters blur the lines or fit into more than one category; while most auditory encounters are only heard by one person, some are heard by others, such as D.S.'s electronic encounter. Some farewell encounters also protect or help the living or pass on helpful information to the survivor.

While the majority of after death encounters are between those who have a strong bond of love, after death encounters where there's no bond with the deceased aren't uncommon. The latter seem most common among first responders and those who work with the seriously ill or dying. Stories like these include those from Mike O., Ed R., and Rita W.

A majority of after death encounters are experienced by someone who knows they're encountering a person or animal who's dead; a few encounters are with those believed to be living at the time of the encounter. The stories from T.B., Mary M., A.J., Emi T., S.T., Jim T., Shelly, and S.A. are the latter type. There are also some encounters where the knowledge of the death is temporarily blocked; it seems perfectly reasonable to see someone or hear someone during the encounter, but afterwards the awareness of "wait... X is dead!" returns, as in Mary M.'s story from her great-grandfather and Shelly's visits from Belly.

**Chapter 3: My First Encounter**

When I was 11 years old, my great-grandmother, Gimma, lived in a small apartment (or possibly a convalescent hospital or retirement home) on Shattuck Avenue in downtown Berkeley.

Gimma had always been very independent. Her husband had died during the great flu epidemic in 1918, leaving her with four children aged five months to ten years. She'd raised them to be smart, independent, and happy, first on a farm in Nebraska, then in the boarding house she ran for UC Berkeley students in California.

Later in life she farmed chickens and turkeys in Santa Rosa before she retired to Ashland, Oregon, where she ran another boarding house, this time at the Ray Minkler House. She later moved into a tiny dwelling just opposite Our Lady of the Mountain Catholic Church in Ashland, where she lived alone until she moved back to Berkeley.

My grandparents helped raise me, and until my mid teens I spent every weekend, holiday, and vacation at their home in Berkeley. While Gimma lived in Berkeley, I often went with my grandmother to visit her.

One night I dreamed I was at Gimma's apartment, but my grandmother wasn't there. Gimma was smiling and looked very happy and much younger than I'd seen her. She hugged me, kissed me, and told me she loved me. She told me it was time for her to go, then she held my face, looked into my eyes, and said, "Don't you forget me!" I promised her I'd never forget.

When I woke up the dream was very clear and I wrote it in my dream diary.

After I got home from school that afternoon, my mother told me Gimma had died during the previous night. I blurted out, "But I just dreamed about her last night!" and ran to get my diary to show my mother the dream from the previous night.

I remember how disconcerting it was going to the visitation and funeral, because I'd seen her, and she'd looked so happy and well. I realized that body wasn't really her, and I've never forgotten her.

**Chapter 4: My Second Encounter**

When I was seven years old, a stray black cat adopted my family. My mother agreed to take her in, and I was given the opportunity to name her. I named her "Lucy" after Lucille Ball; the "I Love Lucy" show was my favorite television program.

My mother took Lucy to the vet for shots and spaying and was shocked when they called to explain that they couldn't spay Lucy; she was a 3-5 year old, already neutered male.

My mother told me many years later that she'd always loved the black cats "Lucifer" and "the Witch of Endor" in L. M. Montgomery's novel "Magic for Marigold." When we found out Lucy was a male, she told me that Lucifer was the closest male name. I cheerfully accepted it and it was two or three years later when a schoolmate asked if it wasn't scary to have a black cat named after the devil. I became very indignant—Lucille Ball was NOT the devil! (My mother had left the Catholic Church long before I was born and although I went to church on Sundays with my grandparents, there had evidently been some rather large gaps in my religious education!)

Lucifer he was and Lucifer he stayed: a sweet, placid, loving cat who slept with me almost every night.

In 1984 I was 23 and Lucifer was about 20 years old. He'd gone blind several years earlier but got around the house just fine. He also enjoyed spending time outside on a lead. We'd learned the hard way that he'd wander off if he was loose, climbing over the six foot plank fences to go exploring. I'd had to go to all the neighbors asking them to check their back yard one day when he'd vanished. By the time I found him, he'd made it three houses away and was happily eating grass in their back garden.

Lucifer was still gentle and good-natured. He loved to sleep on my bed or my mother's bed, where he'd cuddle with and share baths with Regis, Rafi, and Cali, our other cats. He also loved to burrow under the covers and snuggle up to me or my mother.

One morning I woke up as it was getting light and could feel him under the covers, cuddled up against my legs and purring. I snuggled against him and went back to sleep.

I woke up a couple of hours later for work, and my mother had left me a note asking me to wake her up as soon as I got up. I was surprised since she worked nights and slept during the day, but I went in and woke her before I got ready for work. She took my hand and pulled me to sit on the bed and told me that the night before, while she was reading in bed, Lucifer had a seizure. She bundled him into his carrier and drove straight to the emergency vet. The vet told her that there was no hope; Lucifer was already close to death and anything they could do would only prolong his suffering. My mother held him as he was euthanized, then brought his body home so we could bury him in the garden. She'd gotten home at about 3:30 a.m., several hours before I'd woken up to feel him purring and snuggling against me. I saw him out of the corner of my eye for several years.

**Chapter 5: Physical Encounters**

T.B. served as a Catholic priest for many years before leaving the church in protest of the child abuse cover ups. His encounter happened when he was a teenager. He notes that, although this happened over 60 years ago, the memory is still crystal clear.

I was 16 and working a summer job several hours from home. I'd decided on the spur of the moment to drive home for the weekend to surprise my parents. I got a late start Friday night and decided to drive through the mountains closer to home instead of taking the main road that detoured further south to an easier pass. I could usually shave about 2 hours off my trip that way.

I've never been able to remember the actual accident. I was driving and it was a warm, stormy summer night and I was driving pretty slowly because it was hard to see. I'd started through the pass at about 10:30 and driven for a while, when suddenly I was waking up in my car with a big dog right outside my broken side window whining and barking at me. I felt very dizzy and confused and kept closing my eyes. As I regained consciousness and became more oriented I heard a woman's voice calling my name. Looking out of the window, I saw I was about 75 feet down a steep ravine. The woman was standing up at the roadside waving down to me. When she saw me awake she told me I needed to get out of the car right away and come up. I felt very disoriented and cold and the dog kept whining and barking at me. He had a very deep bark that seemed to wake me up and warm me up, and he kept licking my face through the broken window.

I couldn't get the car door open, so I crawled out through the broken window. It seemed to take me hours to get out of the ravine. The woman told me her name was Kathy and reminded me that our mothers knew each other. She talked to me continually, encouraging me the whole time. Sometimes the dog braced me to keep me from slipping backwards. I couldn't put any weight on my left leg, so I was half pulling myself up with my arms. Luckily I could see very well in the bright moonlight to find places to hold onto.

Kathy told me her dog's name was Ned and that he went everywhere with her. He stayed right with me as I climbed up and Kathy remained in my sight the entire time. She kept telling me that I was fine, that I was doing great, and I wasn't alone. Every time it seemed like I couldn't go on, she encouraged me, cajoled me, and even scolded me until I started up again. All the while Ned stayed with me, leaning against me to keep me steady and warm me up.

I finally got to the top. Kathy was sitting at the edge of the road with her arms wrapped around her knees. She looked sad, but she smiled at me and said, "I'm so sorry, Tom. But you're going to be fine, you know. You have so much more to do! And I'm right here with you, you're not alone." Ned settled between us, and Kathy put an arm around him and rubbed his ears. I could tell how much they loved each other.

It was cold, rainy, and pitch black on that road. My head and leg hurt like the dickens. But Ned was warm and he kept me warm leaning against me. I felt very sleepy and sick to my stomach, but Kathy kept talking and scolded me when I wanted to lie down and rest. She said I had to stay awake and upright so I could watch for cars. It seemed like an eternity before I heard a car, and then Ned ran right into the middle of the road. I was scared he'd be hit if the driver didn't see him, so I struggled halfway up on one foot and waved my jacket and arms. The car stopped, and a Mr. and Mrs. Johnson helped me into the car to take me to the hospital. I could finally give in and close my eyes, but I don't know if I slept or passed out.

When we got to the hospital a nurse woke me. It wasn't until then that I realized Kathy and Ned weren't with us. The Johnsons insisted I'd been alone on the road, but I kept insisting Kathy and Ned were still there. I refused to let anyone work on me until they promised they'd send the sheriff out to get Kathy and Ned and make sure they were safe. I don't know if they gave me something or I passed out, but the next thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed with my leg in a cast. I had a compound fracture and a great big knot on the side of my head from the accident.

My parents were there when I woke up that morning. I told them about Kathy and Ned helping me and asked how they were. They didn't answer, but my father went out and came back in with the sheriff, who told me he needed to ask me about the accident before he could tell me anything.

I told him I couldn't remember the actual accident, but Ned had woken me up barking and whining and licking my face until I stayed awake, and how Ned and Kathy had helped me get out of that ravine. I told him I'd almost given up many times and how Kathy'd kept encouraging me.

The sheriff asked me to describe Kathy. I described her the best I could, including her brown hair, curly dark brown hair, sweater, and slacks. I also mentioned the reddish brown collar Ned was wearing and described the bangle bracelets and the little gold cross Kathy had been wearing. The sheriff asked if I was sure of my description, and I said I'd been sitting with them for what seemed like hours and was very sure. I suddenly remembered what Kathy had said about our mothers knowing each other, and I told them about that. My mother turned very pale and said it sounded like Kathy Miller, a daughter of one of her casual friends from church, and she told the sheriff he really needed to make sure she was safe.

The sheriff looked very shaken then. He told us the Johnsons had brought me to the hospital about 5 a.m., then Mr. Johnson had led him to where they'd found me on the road. The sheriff found my car where I'd described it down in the ravine and told me it was a miracle I'd made it up that ravine with my leg so badly broken. He'd gotten down to the car and had trouble getting back up with two good legs and a rope! He also told me that he didn't know how long it would have been until I'd been found if I hadn't been able to get up. From my car he spotted another car further down. He said it looked from the damage to both cars that the other car had come around the sharp curve and hit my car, knocking both cars off the road and down the ravine. The other car had gone much further down the ravine; he'd had to go back to town to get more people and ropes to get down to it safely. The occupants had both died in the crash. They'd retrieved the bodies, and he had the driver's wallet so he could notify the family. Then he asked me if I'd minding looking at a photo from the driver's wallet.

It was Kathy, sitting in the sun with one arm around her knees and the other around Ned, just the way she'd sat by me on the road. She and Ned had been the occupants of the other car and hadn't gotten out alive.

I realized a little later that neither of them had been wet in the storm. I'd been soaking, but Ned had been warm and dry to the touch. I'd never touched Kathy, but she'd looked dry. I remember how I'd had no trouble seeing her or Ned and could see fine to get out of the ravine. I'd thought the moon was out, but it hadn't been; it had been pouring rain all night and black as pitch.

I hadn't really known Kathy well before the accident, although my mother said we'd met several times. Kathy was about 10 years older than I was, and at my age that made a big difference. My mother and Kathy's had known each other all their lives, although they weren't close. After the accident they got much closer and our families often spent holidays together. Her mother became my Aunt Mary, with ties of love rather than blood.

It wasn't until many years later that my mother told me she'd gone to see Aunt Mary the day after the accident and told her Kathy had helped me. Long before that Aunt Mary had given me a framed copy of the photo of Kathy and Ned that I'd seen in Kathy's wallet. I still have it and treasure it, and I thank God, Kathy, and Ned every day for my life.

While I've edited the other stories for grammar and clarity, Mary M. shared this with me with the condition that it be treated as a historical document and transcribed exactly as her great-grandfather wrote it down in 1965. I've honored that request so that I could share this story with you.

Mary M. writes, "This didn't happen to me but to my great-grandfather when he was a boy. He wrote it down for my late mother in the 1960s. My mother told me many times he believed it all his life and if you suggested he was feverish at the time he'd just smile a patient smile and shake his head. I'm sending it to you in his own words, just as he wrote it down on January 7, 1965."

"When I was a boy we lived in a log cabin father had built. I was one of 8 children. Ned was 20 and was away working for the railroad, Edie was 17 and helped Mother with the house and children, I was almost 16, Jack was 11, Mary was 8, Katie was 6, Tom was 4, and Maggie was 2.

There wasn't what you could call a town yet but we had a good doctor in the township. That winter a terrible flu was going around and quite a few people had died. We'd been hit hard, but most of us were better or getting there. But Katie died during that Sunday night and father was very ill and not breathing right, so mother asked me if I'd mind going for the doctor just before dawn Monday.

There was a snow storm and it was several miles to the doctor's house. I must not have been as well as I'd thought, because I got lost in the woods trying to take a shortcut and was getting confused and sleepy from the cold. I stumbled several times but got up, and then finally I just sat there in the snow. I suddenly heard "Billeeeeee!!! BILLEEE!!!" and saw a light, and Father and Katie were standing a ways away. Katie was jumping up and down and calling me and Father was gesturing while he held up a lantern. I was so glad to see them that I was able to get up again and I stumbled over to them. Father was holding Katie's hand and holding up the lamp, but he let go and put an arm around me and Katie took my other hand. They walked me all the way to the doctor's house. I felt weak and dizzy and had trouble knocking, and finally Father stepped up to the door and banged on it for me, then squeezed my shoulder. I looked up at him and he smiled at me, and I saw Katie just behind him, smiling too. The doctor's wife opened the door and ushered me right in. She sat me down by the fire and in a minute I realized Father and Katie hadn't come in. And then I remembered that Katie had died during the night and Father was so sick mother had sent me for the doctor, and on that long cold walk Father and Katie weren't wearing coats!

The doctor's wife gave me a hot drink to take with us and the doctor drove us both to the farm. Edie and Jack came out to meet us. Jack took the doctor's horse into the barn. Edie ushered us in and took the doctor's coat and told us Father had died while I was gone.

To this day I still remember Katie jumping up and down and calling me and Father's lamp lighting the way through the woods to the road and all the way to the doctor's doorway. I remember his arm around me helping me walk and Katie's hand in mind. I remember watching his big hand banging on that thick wooden door and the feel of his hand on my shoulder, squeezing like he did when he was proud of me and didn't know how to say it. It was as real as the pen I'm using to write this.

I believe I was close to death from freezing and that it wasn't my time, and that's why Father and Katie came to help me.

**Chapter 6: Visual Encounters**

M.O. is a retired firefighter. He writes:

This happened many years ago. My crew and I had responded to a fire late at night. It was an older wooden farmhouse. The family had gotten safely out, but they had an old dog they couldn't find, and they were afraid she'd been trapped inside. The parents and children were clustered by their garage and clearly in shock as we worked on the house, while an older woman dressed in a plain blue dress was on the other side of the front garden. She was crouched down with another dog who she was hugging and petting as it wagged its tail so hard that its whole hind end wagged while it tried to lick her.

When the fire was controlled enough that we could check the house, we found their older dog had succumbed to smoke inhalation and was dead. I carried her body outside for the family and looked around for the other woman but couldn't find her. I became concerned that she'd entered the home, which was unsafe. I asked the father where she was, but he told me the family was all accounted for. When I described the woman I'd seen, the gentleman became very upset. He called his wife over and asked me to repeat what I'd told him. She turned pale and said I'd described her grandmother, who'd died the previous month. She'd lived with them for the past few years and the old dog had been hers. The woman had been able to take her purse as they exited the house, and showed me a picture of her grandmother with her dog and her grandchildren, taken several years earlier. It looked very much like the woman and dog I'd seen.

The woman I saw looked completely real to me and so did the dog, but on reflection I realized that while everyone else was watching the house, the two of them were focused only on each other.

Jan S. is retired. She writes:

I was very close to my only living great-grandmother when I was a little girl and lived with her most of the time. I was also named for her. She taught me to cook, to make cookies, cakes, and pies, to can, to garden, to gather eggs, and to milk her goats. She lived outside town where she had half a dozen chickens, two goats, and an enormous garden.

My mother went back to work when I was a very little girl and my father worked as well. They both worked very long hours and neither set of my grandparents were near, so Gran took care of me. I lived with her except during my parents' vacations. Gran and I often prepared dinner together for all of us, and my mother would stop by to pick up some on her way home from work, which could be any time from 5 pm until 9 pm.

I didn't really like my parents' vacations; I missed Gran, the goats, the chickens, and my room. I missed the country sounds.

It was during my parents' vacation when I was 16 that I woke up in my room at their house one night and Gran was there sitting on the bed and smiling at me. She didn't say anything, just sat on the bed nodding and smiling, and I felt how much she loved me. I went back to sleep feeling safe and cherished and loved.

The next day after school, I went over to visit and help her make dinner, but she didn't answer when I called out to her. I looked around and I found her in her bed. Her eyes were closed as if she was asleep, but she was cold and stiff, and I knew she was dead. I called the operator and she sent a doctor over. I called my mother and was calm until she got there, then started crying. We hugged harder than I think I'd ever hugged her before, and we cried together a long time. When we'd both calmed down, I asked her if Gran had looked okay when she'd been over the night before, and she told me Gran hadn't come over.

But I know Gran did, so she could say goodbye to me and let me know she was fine.

Two days later I felt her again. I was cleaning the house and packing up Gran's clothes. I'd given the chickens and goats to the neighbors, who I knew would take good care of them. I didn't know what was going to happen with the house because we didn't have Gran's will and couldn't find it. Suddenly I felt Gran directly behind me, but didn't see her when I turned around. Instead I saw her Bible on the table right where I was facing after turning. I picked up it and looked through it, and there was her will. She'd left me everything, and requested my parents keep the house and contents safe for me until I was an adult. We packed up the things and rented out the house for 5 years.

At last I was 21 and could move back home. I unpacked everything into the right places, and that night was the last time I felt Gran. I woke up again in the middle of the night and she was sitting in her chair, which I'd put in the corner of my room. She was nodding and smiling, just like the last time I'd seen her, and I knew she was happy that I was back in the house where I belonged. I've lived in the same house all my life, got married in the parlor, raised my children, and I'll stay here until I die. I know Gran watches over me and when it's my time to go I'm sure she'll be there nodding and smiling.

Marilyn S. is 81. She and her husband raised four sons who are all happily married with children of her own. Her husband, Roger, died of cancer 6 years ago. She writes:

Roger was my best friend. We grew up on the same street, went to the same schools, and fell in love in High School. He proposed on my 18th birthday and we were married the following June.

Eight years ago Roger starting having terrible pains in his stomach. He'd always been healthy and put off going to the doctor for some time. When he finally did go, he was diagnosed with end-stage cancer. He still chose to go through both chemotherapy and radiation, and he suffered terribly. He lost his hair, his skin turned yellow, and he lost so much weight he was skin and bones. He finally said enough was enough, stopped all cancer treatments, and went into hospice.

Roger had been on high doses of morphine for pain, and it made him sleep most of the time. On the Tuesday he died, he woke up and sounded almost like his old self for several hours. He said he knew it would be soon, and we held hands while I sang to him. Towards evening he suddenly smiled at me and told me his mother liked my singing almost as much as he did, then added, "Don't you, Momma?"

Roger fell into a deep sleep not long after that, and died just before midnight.

I'd loved that man my whole life, and was both devastated that our life together was over and glad that he wasn't hurting. I didn't expect to sleep, but after his body had been picked up and the hospice workers left, I got very sleepy and went to bed.

I slept until just before dawn and woke up with a start. Roger was standing next to the bed smiling at me, but he looked like he'd looked when we were young, strong, and healthy. He didn't say a word, just smiled at me for several minutes, and I felt a sense of peace and love, then he faded away. I was wide awake and sitting up in bed when he faded away, and I know it wasn't a dream. It was Roger showing me he was well and healthy again.

A.T. is a nurse. She writes:

I went into nursing because of my aunt who died when I was 10 years old. Auntie was going to nursing school and planned to become a nurse. She was only ten years older than me and lived with us. She was always there when I got home from school, and when my parents were at work she took care of me. She helped me with my homework before we started preparing dinner, and after my parents got home we all ate together.

Auntie and I shared a room. Every night she'd tuck me in and kiss my forehead, and then she'd check my covers again when she came to bed. I loved her, looked up to her, and wanted to be just like her when I grew up.

One day she didn't feel very well, a few days later she was taken to hospital, and a few days after that she died.

The night after her funeral I was crying in bed when I felt my covers tucked around me and a gentle warm kiss on my forehead, but no one was there. I called for my mom and she hugged me and told me my aunt had visited me to say goodbye.

William S writes that he's 85, terminally ill with cancer, and has never shared this story with anyone since his mother died when he was 14 years old.

My mother was the youngest of nine kids, and I was the youngest of four by many years. My brothers were 18, 16, and 13 years older than me. My maternal grandmother was over 80 by the time I was born. She'd been widowed for many years and had sold most of the farm to my Uncle James. She kept her old house and had a big garden, and as a small boy I spent every summer there. We were very close.

One night when I was, I guess, seven or eight years old, I woke up to Gram calling my name. She was sitting on my bed. The room was surprisingly bright and she was smiling at me. I wanted to hug her but couldn't move.

She told me she had come to see me because she'd promised I could stay the summer with her again and she had to break that promise. She told me she loved me, held out her arms, and suddenly I was in her lap and hugging her as hard I could. I wanted to be sad, but she looked so happy that I started laughing with her as she hugged me.

Then she looked past me and told me I needed to go back to bed. She was laughing, smiling, and crying all at once and said "I'm coming, Eddie!" as she helped me off her lap. She kissed my cheek and whispered she'd always be watching over me. I turned around to get in bed and there was someone there! Then I realized it was me and suddenly I was back in the bed without ever moving, the room was pitch black instead of bright, and I started crying and calling for Gram to come back.

Well, Mother came in and told me it was just a dream. But then the next morning at breakfast she said Gram had died and must have come to tell me goodbye. She said I shouldn't tell anyone I'd seen her after she'd died, that it was something private and special for Gram and me. She also told me then that she believed me about the night before; her father's name had been Edward but Gram had always called him Eddie.

My brother Mike mentioned years later that Gram had died in the middle of the night when I was young. He said for some reason Mom had called Uncle James to check on her. He'd gone next door and found she'd died in bed. I don't think Mom ever told him my part of it.

I went to stay with Uncle James the next summer, but it wasn't the same without Gram there, and I wasn't happy. After that I stayed home summers.

I've never forgotten Gram's coming to say goodbye to me. When Mother was dying when I was 14 and told me she was scared, I told her again about Gram. Mother seemed much calmer after that. I spent a lot of time with her, and she said I was her favorite nurse. Just before she died she smiled and said "Mother!", and then she was gone.

I've got cancer now and the doctors all seem mystified that I'm not willing to fight harder, which to them seems to mean having more chemo and feeling sick as a dog instead of putting my affairs in order. But I know Mother and Gram will be there for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again.

Kelly M. is a stay at home mother of two young children living and one who died at the age of three. She writes:

My daughter Katie was born with birth defects that the doctors told us made it unlikely she'd live more than a few months. She surprised us all by living three years and eight days. Although she was unable to speak and had learned only limited sign language, until her last few weeks, she was alert and almost always happy. She loved music, and we had several music boxes she loved to open and close. Her favorite one had a fairytale castle in it and played "Que Sera Sera." She loved that music box, and so long as she was able she played it every day. She'd pat it to ask to have it wound up when it ran down.

We knew her death was coming and had excellent hospice care. Thanks be to God we were able to keep her at home where she could be with her father and me, her baby sister Emily, and her cat and dog. We'd put our king-sized mattress on the floor of the living room and kept her with us, so she always had me or her father near.

The last few weeks she sometimes smiled at things we couldn't see, and signed "hello" and "goodbye" when no one was there. When I asked her who she was waving to, she signed very insistently "my friend!" My husband and I decided whether or not we could see that friend or believed in that friend, if that friend of Katie's was making her happy, they were welcome in our home.

She started sleeping more about 2 weeks before she died, then one day she woke up and was very alert. She was excited about "my friend" and all day long she signed "I love you" over and over to her father, her sister, the cat, the dog, and me, as well as to her friend. In the late afternoon she fell back into a deep sleep, and a few hours later she died in my arms.

The day of the funeral I broke down crying just before it was time to leave, and suddenly Katie's castle music box began to play "Que Sera Sera," and I felt a gentle "pat-pat-pat" on my hand. I know it was Katie.

Jessie N. is a retired accountant, an artist, and loves to travel. She writes:

My mother was the youngest of a large family. Her mother died just after her birth, and Mother's oldest sister Nell was the only mother she knew. Nell was almost 20 when Mother was born and lived until mother was 64. I grew up knowing "Auntie Nell" almost as well as I knew Mother.

Mother developed Alzheimer's disease in her late 60s and it progressed much faster than the doctors expected. My siblings and I had to make the decision to place her in a care home for Alzheimer patients when it became clearly dangerous for her to be without around the clock care.

Towards the end of Mother's life, she'd often call out "Nellie! Nellie!" in a frightened voice and plead to be taken home. She didn't know any of us anymore, and my siblings and I learned to not remind her she was our mother, because when we did she'd get more frightened and call for help.

The last time I saw Mother alive I was singing one of the songs Auntie Nell had sung to me when I was small. Mother said "Nellie!" but this time she sounded happy instead of distressed. I was holding her hand while I sang, and I noticed her other hand wasn't laying flat on the bed, but instead looked as though it was also being held. Mother smiled at me and then smiled towards her other side, and it felt like Auntie Nell was there, I just couldn't see her.

I sang to Mother until she fell asleep, and after I kissed her, I felt something cool brush my cheek just like Auntie Nell had done when I was small; she always had cold hands.

I'd arrived home and had just started to make dinner when the nurse called to tell me Mother had died. I went back directly, and she still had the smile on her face and her right hand was still curved as if she'd been holding hands with someone.

I know in my heart that Auntie Nell was with Mother when she died.

L.T. collects vintage children's books and works as an aide. She writes:

My granddad always used Old Spice aftershave, never anything else.

He died when I was 23 and my grandmother lived many more years. She was busy, active, and happy until she had a stroke at the age of 72.

I went to the hospital to see her as soon as I got word. My grandmother was unable to speak, sit up, feed herself, or do anything unassisted, but she was awake and alert and recognized me. I sat with her and could tell she was frustrated with her body's failure to do what she wanted it to do. I held her hand and talked to her. After I'd been there about an hour her eyes opened wider and she looked past me, trying to speak. I smelled Old Spice and turned around to see who was there, but no one else was in the room.

I asked her if she smelled it and she squeezed my hand just a little, more than she'd been able to do earlier. I asked her if it was Granddad, and then her hand went limp and alarms went off.

Grandmother was declared dead a short while later. I'm certain Granddad came to get her.

E.M is a retired elementary school teacher. She writes:

I'm the only child of parents who married late in life. They retired and moved out of the country when I was grown. When my father had a fatal heart attack in early 1983, my mother assured me she was fine. She told me I was welcome to come up to visit, but reminded me that Dad hadn't wanted a funeral, so his body was being cremated and his ashes scattered. She knew she knew it was almost the end of the school year and felt I should wait to visit when school was over for the summer so I wouldn't disrupt my young students unnecessarily.

I reluctantly agreed, but I phoned her every evening until she told me I was "hovering" and reiterated that she was perfectly fine.

Five weeks later I arrived for the promised visit, and my mother really was perfectly fine. I'd been worried despite her assurances, but she was as busy as ever with her volunteering and social life and her laugh was as deep and boisterous as ever. While there was an obvious gap where my dad should have been and she admitted she missed him terribly, she really was quite well. We had a lovely day together.

That evening we were sitting in the lounge when I smelled roses. I looked around but there were none to be seen, and I finally asked my mother if she smelled them.

She smiled and nodded. "It's your father. He stops by every night to check on me and let me know he's fine."

I looked at my mother in shock and she started laughing. "I haven't gone whackadoodledoo, dear. John gave me roses on our first date and gave me roses every week of our life together, always the best ones that smelled wonderful. I've not brought a single rose into the house since he died, but every evening the lounge is filled with the smell of roses. I know it's your father, checking on me and reminding me he loves me."

We never really talked about it again, but I did smell roses every night in the lounge whenever I visited.

When I got the call 13 years later that Mother had collapsed at church and died at the hospital, I flew up to take care of everything.

I was there two weeks taking care of what I could and hiring people to take care of what I couldn't, and I didn't smell roses a single time. I admit I started to wonder if my mother had been playing a trick on me. However when I got home and opened my front door, I smelled roses—and I smelled Mother's perfume, too, and knew they were together and watching over me.

Jim T. writes:

I was 19 and my big brother was 22 when we were serving in Vietnam. We were stationed in the same area but were in different units.

One day I heard him right behind me yelling "GET DOWN!" and I dropped like a rock. That saved my life, although I was still injured; there was a sniper attack just after I dropped and three others in my unit were killed.

I was pretty busted up and had a lot of surgery. I don't remember how long I was out of it. When I finally woke up and knew where I was, I asked for my brother and found out that he'd been killed by sniper fire about two hours before I was shot.

All my life he'd watched out for me, and I know Dad had told him to make sure I was okay while we served. I guess he took that just as seriously after he died as he'd taken it while he was alive.

Scott M. works in the Critical Care field. He writes:

My father and I were very close; he was my best friend and role model and was thrilled when I went into medical school to follow in his footsteps.

When I was 24 I changed my mind and decided to go into nursing instead. Dad got very upset and we had the first fight I ever remember us having.

Three days later he was crossing the street to his car after work when he was hit by a car and killed. My mother refused to have an open casket because of the head wounds he'd sustained, so I never saw his body again.

After the funeral service I'd walked back to my car and sat in it in tears. I couldn't believe he was gone and I couldn't stop crying. Suddenly I felt warm, like I was being hugged with love instead of arms, and I heard my father's voice as clear as a bell say, "I love you Scotty, and I'm proud of you. Never doubt that!"

One night when I was 17, my dog Max woke me up. He was whining and barking right in my face. I felt sleepy and groggy, and all I wanted was to go back to sleep. Max kept whining, barking, and licking my face and suddenly I smelled smoke. I switched on the light and my wall heater was smoking. I yelled for my mom and brother to wake up and put my clothes on over my pajamas. I felt the doorknob and it wasn't warm so I went into the hall. The air was better there and my mom was coming out of her room with our other dog, Edison, and my brother had our cat, Pushkin.

Mom grabbed the phone from the living room as we went out the front door and she called the fire department while my brother turned off the electricity at the box.

Then I noticed Max wasn't out with us and said I had to go get him. My mom grabbed my arm, sort of shook me, and told me to wake up. I told her I was awake, and then I remembered Max had died the week before. Except he'd just woken me up, and I saw him go out through the bedroom door ahead of me.

A funny thing was I got Max when I was about 5 years old, and he'd died of old age. When I thought about it, when he was licking my face, his muzzle was solid black, not gray like it had been for a few years.

Mary E writes:

This has always been one of my favorite stories and my Nan swears it's absolutely true.

In 1940 my Nan lived in London in a small flat with her mother and her two year old brother Paul.

Nan's father was an officer who was out of town often and lived on base. His best friend all his life had a heart condition and couldn't serve, so he became a driver for officers, including Nan's father.

It was just getting light the morning Nan's mother woke her and told her they were evacuating and to dress herself and Paul and pack their things as quickly as she could. Nan did as she was told and then took Paul and their valise into the main room. Her father was there leaning against the door. She called out to him and ran over to hug him, but he held up a hand to stop her, and she saw he had blood on his face and hands as though he was hurt. He held one arm against his middle but he held out his other hand to her. She took it, and he pulled her close enough to kiss her cheek and then kissed Paul's cheek. She said his hand and lips were cold as ice.

She said her mother turned very pale then and finished packing very quickly. Her father just watched her mother and seemed very sad. They never said a word to each other.

It only took a minute or two more before her mother closed the big valise. They all went down the stairs, her father last.

There was a car in front, and the driver was Jim, her father's best friend. He also looked very pale. Nan's father kissed her and Paul again before they got in the car, then kissed her mother, who ignored him. Nan thought her mother was angry about being evacuated and that's why she didn't speak or kiss him back.

Nan saw her mother had tears running down her face as Jim drove them away. Nan looked back and saw her father standing in the road at attention and she said it looked like there was a big piece missing from his side that he'd been hiding. She saw Jim watching him in the mirror and return the salute, and then they turned a corner. Paul was fast asleep again and soon Nan fell asleep as well. She woke when they were slowing down.

Nan, her mother, and Paul stayed with her mother's family and Jim drove back to town. A few days later Nan's mother told her that her father had been killed during a bombing.

After the war Nan's mother and Jim married. He was a wonderful father and always treated her and Paul like they were his own flesh and blood.

It wasn't until her mother was dying many years later that she asked Nan if she'd remembered the night they'd evacuated. Nan told her what she remembered and her mother cried and told her more, because she and Jim had talked about it many times. Jim had been woken up by her father's voice but didn't see anyone. Her father had begged Jim to help him one last time and go evacuate Nan's family right away. Jim couldn't convince himself it was a dream, so he went.

When he got to the building, Jim saw Nan's father standing at attention in front, terribly injured. Nan's father asked Jim to take care of Nan, Paul, and their mother for him, and Jim gave his word. Nan's father said he'd go get them and faded away. In just a few minutes Nan, Paul, and their mother came down the steps alone and got into the car, then in the mirror Jim had seen her father salute them as he started the car.

Nan's mother had woken to her husband's voice as clear as anything, telling her she needed to pack quickly and evacuate because there was a car waiting. She looked out and saw Paul with the car, and she knew then something was very wrong. When she saw Nan call out to her father and hold hands with nothing, she knew her husband must be dead. She never saw her husband, even though Jim and Nan did, she only heard his voice the one time.

Three nights later the building their flat was in was destroyed in the bombing.

Nan had never had any idea that her father was already dead that night. She knew he'd been injured and was cold, but he'd felt as solid as Paul did. She went to Jim to ask about it, thinking her mother might be confused, but he told her the same thing. When he described her father's injuries, they were the same ones she'd seen.

L.T. is a counselor who works with at risk youth. Her encounter was protective as well as auditory. She writes:

My father died when I was young, and my mother raised me on her own. We were very close and she was my best friend. Mom was an elementary school teacher who loved reading, her garden, animals, and her friends and family, and she was loved by everyone she knew.

The minute I realized I might be pregnant, I called to tell her before running out to get a test kit. When it was positive I called her immediately after I called my husband. She was as delighted as we were, and couldn't wait to be a grandmother.

Six months later my mother died unexpectedly. I found out later the autopsy showed that she'd had several silent heart attacks. I was devastated, but did my best to focus on the baby.

Our daughter was perfect and beautiful, and we named her for my mother.

A week after her birth, when I was still recovering, I woke up to my mother telling me very urgently, "Lisa! Jenny needs you!" As I woke up more, I realized it must have been a dream and went back to sleep, only to be woken again in that voice all children know and can't help obeying, "LISA MARGARET! GO CHECK ON JENNY THIS INSTANT!"

I was on my feet and across the room to the crib before I was completely awake. I found Jenny gasping, and her color was wrong. I screamed for my husband, grabbed Jenny, and ran out the front door in my nightgown without ever thinking of shoes or slippers.

We lived directly across from the driveway only ambulances used at the local hospital. I ran up it with Jenny, screaming for help. And bless them, they let me right in, despite the sign that said "Ambulance Entrance Only." One nurse took Jenny while another hugged me and urged me to breathe. I remember how kind she was and how terrified I was. I was shaking and couldn't stop crying.

My husband arrived just a minute behind me, dressed and carrying clothes and shoes for me. He was able to answer all their questions for the paperwork until the nurse asked what made me check on Jenny.

I told her, "My mother woke me up telling me Jenny needed me. I fell back asleep and she woke me up again, telling me to check on her right away." I repeated what she'd said with her intonation. "By the time I was on my feet, I still wasn't awake, but as soon as I saw Jenny I picked her up and ran over here." The nurse asked, "What did your mother do?" and I repeated she'd woken me up. The nurse started to say something about my mother could have done more when David turned to the nurse and said, "You don't understand; Lisa's mother died three months ago."

Jenny recovered completely and is a healthy and happy highschooler now. She attends the same school where my mother taught. Thanks, Mom! I love you!

When I was a young girl, my family lived outside town on a small home farm. I was home alone one Sunday. I'd been sick and was still weak, so I stayed home while my family went to church.

I was reading in the parlor when I heard one of the dogs bark his "stranger!" bark. I looked out and there was a man I didn't know coming up the walk. I suddenly heard my Grandmother's voice very loudly and clearly. She told me to lock the doors as fast as I could, shut the windows, and hide in the cellar, and I did so. I ran down the cellar steps and hid behind the furnace. I could hear him rattling the doors and windows and using foul language. He finally left and I was still hiding when my family got home.

I told them what happened and about hearing Grandmother's voice, and my mother reminded me Grandmother was dead. I told her I knew that, but she sounded alive and like she expected to be obeyed!

They didn't say anything more about it. Mother put me to bed and gave me bread and milk, then she sat with me until I went to sleep. When I still wasn't well the next Sunday, my oldest brother stayed home with me.

Mother didn't tell me the next part of the story until many years later. The next day they'd heard that a strange man had broken into another house up the road and attacked a girl who was home alone. She was several years older than me and had been able to escape outside, then she'd ran all the way to town. My parents thought he'd come to our house next and that he would've hurt me if he'd gotten in the house.

I'm glad Grandmother told me what to do and kept me safe.

**Chapter 11: Encounters with Strangers**

Ed R. is an EMT. He writes:

Two times I've seen the dead as though they were still alive, both during work. The first time it happened, I swear I almost drove right off the side of the road. We'd been called out for a car crash, and it was a bad one. A teenage girl had driven off a sharp curve and died at the scene. It was terrible, with injuries that were incompatible with life. She was so young, younger than my youngest sister.

As we drove away from the scene with her remains, I thought I saw someone behind me reflected in the windshield. I let out a yell and almost went off the road, and my partner grabbed the wheel. Between the two of us we got the ambulance pulled over safely to the side of the road. My partner gave me a look, and I told her I'd seen a young girl's face and it looked like the dead girl. I remember how it felt like all my hair was standing on end.

My partner's response left me with my mouth hanging open because she was matter of fact about it. She turned around and said to the back of the ambulance, "You're okay, but you died in that crash. It's okay to go on to what's next now; you don't need to stay with your body anymore." She said a short prayer and the hair on the back of my neck settled down.

My partner told me the same thing had happened to her a few times and that as far as she knew it was just a soul being confused because they'd died so suddenly. When it happened she told them out loud that they'd died and said a brief prayer for the one who'd died and their family.

She said she only got spooked once. She went to get in her own car at the end of a shift, and when she looked in the rear view mirror she saw the little girl who'd died earlier climb in the seat through the closed back door. The little girl was just watching her. My partner said she'd turned around to look directly in the back seat and didn't see the girl, but she tried to look where she'd seen her in the mirror. She told the little girl very gently that she was okay, but she'd died and it was time to look for a bright light to guide her home. Then she'd said a prayer and felt a sense of peace and gratitude.

The second time I saw the dead was after another crash. A car had crashed, trapping the driver and a large dog in the car. It took some time to get into the car, and I noticed a big dog waiting several feet away, whining and watching. When the firefighters got the door opened and were able to get the driver out, they discovered the young man had been impaled and was dead, while the dog had terrible head injuries and was dying.

The other dog whined again, then I heard a shrill whistle from the woods off the road. I looked OVER and saw the watching dog's ears perk up. He went running over to a young man who looked just like the one who was dead right in front of me, and they faded away.

Kathy G.'s mother met a young boy at the hospital who needed help. Kathy writes:

My late mother was a nurse. She told me this story and always maintained it happened exactly this way.

She'd arrived at the hospital about 30 minutes early for her shift. She worked nights, so it was a little before 10:30 pm. There was a bench outside the emergency room and a boy about 9 or 10 years old was sitting on it, swinging his legs. My mother was concerned that he was out alone so late and sat down with him, asking him his name and why he was alone.

He told her his name was Tom Johnson (I've changed his name for his family's privacy) and that his mother was inside and was crying. He said he felt bad that she was so sad. Mama asked him if his mother was hurt and he told her no, someone else got hurt. Mama took his hand and led him inside, reassuring him quietly that it was okay. He tugged her towards the bereavement room and the name on the chart matched, so she dropped his hand to knock, but the door wasn't latched properly and opened just a little. Tom slipped inside and the door closed again.

Mama went to sign in and at shift change a few minutes later she mentioned that Tom Johnson had been alone outside when she'd arrived for work, so she'd let him in with his mother. The room went completely silent and everyone stared at her, then one doctor ran for the door. The other staff members told her Tom Johnson had been hit by a car and had died at the hospital just after 10 pm; his mother was in the bereavement room alone.

The doctor who had run out came back in a few minutes later and was as white as a ghost. He'd gone to check on Mrs. Johnson, and she'd told him that about a half hour earlier she'd had the funniest feeling that Tom had suddenly been right there with her. She felt like he'd promised her that he was okay and that he was sorry he'd made her so sad, and it felt like he'd hugged her.

Later Mama asked the doctor and nurses who'd worked on Tom what he'd looked like and what he'd been wearing, and it was exactly like the boy she'd seen, except her Tom was clean and unhurt.

**Chapter 12: Farewells**

J.R. is a retired schoolteacher. She has four children, seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren, with at least one John in ever generation as well as a granddaughter Jacqueline and great-granddaughter Jackie. She writes:

My parents met when my mother was only 15. My father John was 22 and had been hired as an assistant at Grandfather's store. He had a deformity of his right arm, but Grandfather said he managed to work twice as hard as any other assistant. Grandfather quickly promoted him.

Mother and Father met when he was invited over for supper, and it was love at first sight. When Grandfather had a heart attack two years later, Father did such a fine job running the store that he was made a partner.

The June after Mother turned 18 they married, and the following summer my brother Jack was born.

Mother was pregnant with me when we entered WWII. Father was pleased that despite his arm he was eligible to enlist, and he was one of the first young men in town to do so.

They put their furnishings in storage and Mother and Jack moved home with her parents.

One night five months later they'd sat down to dinner when the lights suddenly went off and came back on. It happened twice more, so Grandfather went to check the circuits while Mother, Grandmother, and Jack stayed at the table. Suddenly Mother felt a hug from behind, just the way Father would come up and hug her. The lights flickered again, Jack stared over Mother's head and yelled, "Dad!", then Mother fainted. She said later she'd felt a hug from behind, just the way John did when she was sitting down.

When the telegram came, Mother told her parents she already knew. When she'd felt the hug and Jack called out, she knew John was dead and had come to say goodbye.

I was born two weeks later. Mother said just after I was born she felt Father there again and in her head she heard him saying how much he wished he could have seen me before he died. She was never sure if she was dozing and dreamed it or if it really happened, but she always took comfort in it.

I've always like the story of my father coming back long enough to see me.

E.B. writes:

My youngest son was 17 when he didn't come home one night. He'd walked out on a beautiful Saturday morning and completely disappeared. We contacted his friends, contacted the police, and no trace of him was found for weeks.

I was in despair; he was my baby. As the weeks went by with no answers I sunk into depression. My children's father had been gone 15 years, and my second husband and I had been married 3 years. He was fond of the children and worried about my son, but he was more worried about me.

I was sitting in the garden late one afternoon when suddenly my son walked in through the gate. I jumped up to hug him, crying in relief, but he held his hand out and stepped back, and when I tried to touch him, I felt only coolness. He told me he'd died, but he was fine and sorry to cause me so much grief. I collapsed back into the chair and he squatted down beside me. He was glowing; it looked like golden light was shining through his skin. He looked so well and so happy, but I couldn't touch him.

He told me he'd caught the bus to the beach and spent the day there. He fell asleep and woke up when it was dark and the beach fairly deserted. He decided on one last swim before heading home, but he was caught in the undertow. Suddenly he was watching his body from above as it sank and became tangled in something underwater.

He said he came to tell me that the wait was almost over; his body would be found the next day. He urged me not to look at it myself, but to have his oldest brother identify his body instead. He told me what trunks he'd been wearing, that he had ID in an inside pocket of them, and reminded me of the small tattoo he'd gotten illegally the year before: a dolphin on his right ankle.

He told me again that he loved me and that he really was fine and happy. He smiled his widest smile and looked like he looked at his happiest. Then he dissolved into golden light so bright it dazzled my eyes.

I went inside and told my husband about it, but he thought I'd fallen asleep and dreamed the entire thing. I wrote it all down anyway because it seemed so real, and part of me was convinced it had happened exactly as I remembered it.

The next day we received a visit from a police officer asking us to come in to identify a body that they thought was my son. I called and asked my oldest son to do it and told him the trunks his brother had been wearing, that there should be ID in the inside pocket, and reminded him about the tattoo of a dolphin on the outside of his brother's right ankle.

It was my son's body, and it was just as he'd told me. My oldest son told me the medical examiner had told him the body was in bad shape and suggested he not try looking at the face but only at the tattoo, which he did.

I'd never really believed in life after death before, and it still hurts 20 years later than my son died so young. But I know I'll see him again. In the meantime I now believe everyone who dies is probably just as well and happy as my son was.

S.A. is an estate-planning professional with two grown children. She writes:

I don't remember this myself but my mother has told me the story many times.

My mother's mother had a stroke when I was four years old. They'd told me Nana was in the hospital, but I didn't understand what it meant.

One afternoon my mother heard me laughing and singing in the back garden. After a while I came running in and called to her that I was getting my tea set. Mother was sewing, and as long as she could hear me and knew I was in the house or fenced back yard and sounded happy, she often let me play on my own.

She looked outside a while later and I'd set up my tea set at my little table with three places set. I was at one place, my baby doll was at one place, and I was laughing and chattering a mile a minute to the third place where there was an empty chair. She watched me for a few minutes before the phone rang. She answered it and found out her mother had just died, so she sat down to have a little cry.

She heard me say, "bye-bye Nana!" a few minutes later, and I came dancing into the house, full of smiles. I told her Nana was all better and had come for tea, but then she had to go to heaven so she gave me an extra kiss for my mother. I kissed her on the cheek, and she could smell her mother's perfume on me.

C.L. is a retired police office who rescues feral cats and fosters kittens. She writes:

My husband was also a police officer. After eight years of happy marriage together, he died on duty. We were working different shifts and I was asleep when it happened. I was dreaming about him, and he kept telling me to look in the back of the closet because he'd gotten me a birthday present. He said he wanted me to have it now and wear it for his funeral instead of waiting for my birthday.

I woke up to the knock on the door that notified me of his death. I didn't remember the dream until that night when I was in bed and getting sleepy. I went to the closet and found there was a small box just where he'd told me to look. Inside was a beautiful turquoise pendant of a butterfly I'd seen in Albuquerque when we'd gone there for a short vacation the month before. I'd loved it, but it was expensive. I hadn't known he'd realized how much I wished I could get it.

I wore it to his funeral, as he'd asked. I also wore it whenever I was out of uniform for five years, and I thought of him every time.

J.F. is a widower whose only son died young. He writes:

My only son died at the age of eight; his mother had died not long after he was born.

Jamie and I were very close and I raised him alone despite my in-laws and family's objections.

Jamie had asked for a kitten when he was five years old. I agreed, and he picked one out, named her Oodle, fed her, helped clean her litter pan, and was always very gentle with her.

Oodle loved Jamie, too. She slept on his bed, and every night she'd go lay on the bed for reading time. She'd purr and knead on his favorite blanket, nudging his hand with her head to get her favorite places rubbed for several minutes before settling in against him.

Jamie was hit by a car on his way home from school and died the same day. That night Oodle went to his bed like usual, purring and kneading the blanket. I sat beside her and cried. She slept in there all night and I curled up and slept beside her.

The next night she did the same thing, and I sat on the bed and rubbed her ears, telling her Jamie had died. Suddenly I felt like Jamie was in the room and I froze. Oodle began licking the air and purring, the way she did if someone rubbed the base of her back by her tail. I let my hand drop from her head and she kept kneading the bed, purring, and licking the air. The feeling of Jamie being there faded, and Oodle settled down against my thigh, curling up in a purring ball.

I believe my son said goodbye to both of us.

Oodle had a long life with me. I kept Jamie's bed until she died at a grand old age. She slept on it every night for the rest of her life.

Dennis E. is a computer engineer. He's married and has three grown children. He writes:

In my family everyone grew up hearing my great-grandmother's story. I've always heard her called "Grandma Edwards", but I never met her. She died a few years before I was born.

Grandma Edward's second daughter, Elizabeth, had died when she was only eight years old. Many years later Granddad Edwards had a stroke and was taken to the hospital. He wasn't able to walk or speak afterwards and couldn't eat on his own. My great-grandmother knew he hated being dependent. She went over every day to see him; she'd sit with him, hold his hand, and tell him all the news. My mother was staying with her to help out and drove her back and forth to the hospital.

Grandma Edwards said she dreamed about Granddad Edwards almost every night, but always everyday sort of dreams. Then one day about four months after his stroke she had a very vivid dream that she and Granddad Edwards were both young and healthy again. They were walking arm in arm at the old farm they'd had years before. They'd sold it in the 20s to move to town so their daughter Emily could attend high school without a two hour walk each way.

Granddad told her he'd come to say goodbye and that he loved her. Suddenly there was a familiar looking little girl with him, and he said, "And look who's here to walk home with me! It's Lizzie!" Grandma Edwards realized it was their daughter, Elizabeth.

She woke up with a start and her face was wet with tears. She got up and washed her face just before the phone rang. My mother answered it and came in to tell her it was the hospital calling to say that Granddad Edwards had just died.

C.R. has three children, 12 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren. She's a very active volunteer in her church. Her encounter was both a dream encounter and an auditory encounter. She writes:

My husband and I met in church when I was 17. He had very dark brown wavy hair and bright blue eyes, and I fell for him the first time I saw him. We married a year later, when I was 18 and he was 27.

We had a very happy life together. After his retirement we took trips each year, but our life at home was pleasant, too. We both enjoyed gardening, volunteer work, and keeping busy during the day, then relaxing together in the evening.

I'd serve dinner at 5:30, when we'd clean up together. In the summer we often spent time in the garden reading or catching up on any gardening if it had been too warm to do it during the day. But in the winter we settled into the family room after dinner. I'd have my crocheting and my husband loved working on rugs. Back in the 1970s our youngest daughter had giving him a rug hooking kit and he enjoyed it. By the mid 1980s he was making his own designs and giving them as gifts to family and friends.

We'd watch something pleasant on television while we worked together, and the soft clicking of the latch hook was very soothing for me.

Just after our 60th anniversary, R. had a heart attack. He survived and did well for a time, and he continued to enjoy designing and making rugs. But then three years later he had a second heart attack, and this time he didn't do well. The doctors told us the odds of surgery helping were minimal due to his age, so he elected to do his best to enjoy his remaining time instead. His doctor put him in a home hospice program and was clear that it was just a matter of time. R. and I have always had a very strong faith, and while I was sad to think of him passing, I knew he'd be with the Lord.

A nurse came over every morning to check on R., but we didn't need further help. He could still get up and down with some help from me. At first he was still able to work on his last rug, but after a while he was only able to do a few pieces of yarn before his hands trembled and he got too weak to enjoy the work. After that he'd watch television and doze while I crocheted.

One night we were watching a show about the history of Christianity on the History Channel. I was very sleepy and drifted off sitting up in my chair, something I never do. I was in the back garden with R., but he was young and strong, with that dark, wavy hair I'd fallen for. We walked through the garden holding hands, then as we walked back towards the house he spoke. He told me he loved me and he promised he'd always be with me, but he was glad to be out of that old wreck of a body, too! We walked inside and the television was on, and then suddenly I was back in my chair and the television was still on the same scene.

I turned to R. to tell him about my dream, but as soon as I saw him I knew he'd passed. I called the hospice number and someone arrived 15 minutes later. She stayed with me until his body was picked up, when I told her I'd be fine and she could go. I called our children and the church, and I went to bed and cried for a while, both in sadness that he was gone and in relief that it had been the gentle passing we'd both prayed for.

Our house was full of family the next week as they all came and stayed for the funeral, then my granddaughter S. stayed for another week. By the end, as much as I loved her, I was ready to get back to my routine.

That night I settled in with my crocheting, and put on the History Channel. Another show (or it may have been the same one) on Christianity was on, and I left it on quietly, muting it during the commercials.

It was muted and I was focusing on my pattern when I realized I'd been hearing a familiar soft clicking noise for some time. I looked over, but of course R. wasn't there. But all evening I heard that soft noise, and in my mind's eye I saw the younger R. look up at me and wink before going back to his rug.

It's been 5 years now, and I sometimes still hear the clicking noise of the rug hook in the evening. I know R. is with me, just as he promised.

J.S. is a consultant whose first husband died not long after they were married. She writes:

Mike and I grew up together, fell in love in high school, and got married after my graduation. Mike was two years older and already working as a travelling salesman. It was hard seeing so little of him, but he called home every day just to say he loved me. We lived near my family and friends in a tiny apartment, so I wasn't lonely.

Mike was on a business trip and I was expecting him back the next night when the phone woke me up about 5 a.m.. When I answered it there was only static. I went back to sleep for a few minutes and had a very vivid dream of Mike telling me he was sorry. He said he loved me and always would. I could smell his aftershave when he hugged me and kissed my nose. The phone woke me up again, and again there was just static. I tried to get back into the dream of Mike but couldn't, so I got up.

About 30 minutes later there was a knock on the door. It was a policewoman who asked to come in, and I knew then the news was bad.

She told me Mike had been killed in an accident just after 5 a.m., the same time the phone rang the first time. He'd been only a short ways from home, so he must have driven through the night to get home early and surprise me. A semi hit his car and he was killed.

I believe the phone calls were from him and that he came into my dream to tell me goodbye.

P.B. is a disability activist who writes:

I'd known my friend S. all my life. When he got ill, he tried everything, but in the end the cancer killed him. The day after he died, I dreamed he rang me up. He said he was fine and asked me to tell his parents how much he loved them, then he asked me to pick up a book he'd ordered for them at the local bookshop, saying it was already paid for. He didn't tell me the title of the book.

When I woke up I remembered the dream much more clearly than any other dream I'd ever had. I called the bookshop, feeling rather embarrassed, and asked if S. had ordered a book. It turned out he had, and it had just come in. I explained the circumstances of his death, and they told me he'd mentioned it was a gift for his parents, so they'd wrapped it for him. They let me pick up it and I took it over to his parents.

I told his parents about the dream and then handed them the wrapped book. His mother opened it, and it was "Questions & Answers on Death & Dying" by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross.

**Chapter 14: Encounters with Those Thought to Be Alive**

Bob R. is a retired mechanic. He writes:

When I was a young man, my first wife and our two daughters were in a car accident. My wife was killed immediately, our baby daughter had a broken leg, and our four year old daughter Anna was very badly hurt. She went in and out of consciousness. When she was conscious she was confused and couldn't seem to track what anyone was saying. She just kept whispering "Mama!" the first day. The doctors advised not telling her the truth in case she might understand and get more upset, so instead I told her that her mother had been hurt in the accident and couldn't come to her.

The doctors warned me that Anna would probably not survive, so my mother and I both sat with her around the clock. The second day she didn't wake up until evening when she suddenly opened her eyes, smiled her happiest smile, and said, "Mama's here and we're going! Mama's all better! I'm almost all better! She loves Lizzie and she loves you, Daddy! And Nanna! And Grandma and Poppy! And I love you all, too!" Her voice was barely more than a whisper, but my mother and I both heard it. She lapsed back into unconsciousness and died a few hours later, with my mother and I holding her hands.

My mother and I often talked about what had happened, and we both found it very comforting. The doctor dismissed it as a hallucination, but if it was one, it was one that made Anna's passing comfortable for her as well as giving me and my mother the hope that she was with her mother and that they were both "all better!"

A.J. is a retired nurse who volunteers at the local hospice and her church and fosters animals. She writes:

My only daughter died when she was five years old. My husband was stationed overseas when she had what started as a bad cold. Pamela died 10 days later.

I wrote to my husband as soon as the doctor told me there was no hope and again when Pamela died. She was buried in her Sunday dress, with her beloved stuffed rabbit snuggled up next to her.

A month later I got a long letter from my husband, who'd been wounded in action the day after Pamela died (and long before he'd gotten either letter).

He wrote to me that his unit had walked into a trap and he'd been badly hurt. He was lying in some underbrush and sure he was dying when suddenly Pamela was sitting on the ground next to him as clear as anything. She was wearing her Sunday dress and holding his hand. She said, "Daddy! Don't be scared, you're going to be okay! I won't leave you!" She told him she loved him and that he'd see me soon when he went home. She had her stuffed rabbit, Jack, and she set him on D.'s chest and reminded him that Jack was her "most favoritest" name. She sat with him until he heard voices speaking English. He passed out then and woke up later at the hospital.

Pamela was right. Her father was sent home rather the worse for wear, but he recovered fairly well. Three years later we had a beautiful son whom we named John and called Jack, in honor of Pamela's "most favoritest name."

Jack's favorite toy was a stuffed bear. D. and I called his bear Teddy, like all bears, but when Jack started talking, he told us very emphatically that his bear's name was Pammy. Jack and Pammy were inseparable; even long after she got bedraggled and he felt too old for a stuffed animal, he kept her in his closet.

We always had pictures of D., me, and Pamela in the house, but we didn't really talk about them. One Sunday afternoon when Jack was about four, he stared at one of the pictures of Pamela for a long time then climbed into D.'s lap with the picture and announced that the girl in the picture was the "other Pammy" who picked out his bear, and that's why his bear was named Pammy. Then he told us that he'd picked out Pamela's bunny and that was why she'd named him Jack. He went to sleep in D.'s lap a short while later, and D. and I sat there for a long time together, cuddling Jack and feeling stunned.

We had supper late and when I put Jack to bed, he hugged me and told me I didn't need to miss my Pammy, because she was always around. I cried myself to sleep in D.'s arms that night.

Jack never talked like that again, and when I asked him when he was older, he didn't remember any of it.

D. and I always remembered it although we didn't talk about it often. D. died a few years ago. Knowing that Pamela and Jack could be so close and love each other so much even though they didn't live at the same time is very comforting to me. It gives me hope that D. is with Pamela now, watching over Jack and me.

Emi T. is describes herself as a SAHM ("stay at home mom") of three. She writes:

I had a wonderful best friend when I was about five. We'd moved to a house from our apartment to be closer to the doctor because I needed special treatments. I was very sick for the first few months we lived there. Lia came into my room one day when I was home alone. She was just a little older than me. She seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see her, but we become best friends immediately. I was weak and had to stay in bed most of the time, so I'd be alone in my room when my mother and father were at work and my brother and sisters went to school. After Lia arrived, whenever I felt scared and lonesome, she always showed up and held my hand. When I was sick and miserable she'd sit with me, sing songs her mother sang to her, and tell me stories. She seemed very real to me, but my family made jokes about my "imaginary friend." I remember getting very angry that they'd tease her by pretending they didn't see her, but Lia said they were just worried about me and not to worry about it.

When I got better and stronger, I could go in the back garden to play. Lia and I loved to have tea parties with my dolls there. One day we were playing in the garden and my mother needed me. When I went back outside Lia was gone. I called and called for her but she never came back. My mother told me she must have moved and I was heartbroken. Later I made other friends, especially once I was well enough for school, but I never forgot Lia and how much she helped me when I was so sick. When my daughter was born three years ago, I named her Lia over my mother's objections, and I sing the songs Lia sang to me to my own children, who love them as much as I do.

Not long after my daughter was born, my oldest boy started talking about an imaginary friend. When I told my mother about it, she got very upset and asked me to invite my Auntie Maymay for a visit. She refused to say why or tell me what had upset her. I invited Auntie and it was a pleasant visit. She spent a lot of time with the children, including playing with my oldest boy and his imaginary friend. I still didn't understand why my mother had gotten upset, so the last day of Auntie's visit, I finally pressed her to tell me.

She told me she'd come to visit when I was a little girl, about a year after we'd moved to that house, and she'd seen me playing with a little girl she could see right through. She went in and asked my mother if she knew the little girl I was playing with, and my mother told her about my imaginary friend Lia. She told my mother to keep me inside for a little, then Auntie came out and told me my mother needed my help. While I was inside she talked to Lia and told her she was dead. She said Lia seemed surprised that Auntie would talk to her and puzzled about what Auntie meant by being dead, but when Auntie told her to look for a bright light she suddenly started to glow brighter and brighter until she disappeared.

Later Auntie talked to neighbors and found out the previous occupants of the house had a little girl named Lia who'd died only a few weeks before we moved in. The description of that Lia matched my Lia.

Mother was worried that I might have called my friend Lia's spirit back by naming my daughter Lia. Because Auntie had seen her before, she wanted Auntie to come check.

S.T. is 27 and works as a primary school teacher.

When I was young we had a very, very shy little white cat named Fluff. I couldn't remember a time she hadn't been there, and I loved her as much as I loved my parents.

Fluff looked like her name, a little ball of fluff. She wouldn't let me touch her directly; she'd run away faster than I could see when I tried. Because I didn't want her to run away, I learned to not try to pet her. She'd only come out at night when I was in bed with the lights out, slipping into my room and jumping up on the bed. She'd stomp around for a minute making biscuits, then settle against me, a warm, purry little heater. If I stayed under the covers, I could stroke her gently through them. If my door was closed at night she'd cry and scratch at it, so I always left it open a crack.

I still remember the night before my seventh birthday, the night she went away. I woke up and there was a familiar-looking lady in my room, but I didn't know who she was. Fluff was sitting on her lap and purring; I couldn't remember ever seeing anyone touch Fluff before. The lady told me it was time for Fluff to go, but she'd only go if I told her it was okay. I started crying and the lady hugged me and held me in her lap, too, and for the first time I could remember, I touched Fluff without her running away.

I asked why she had to go, and the lady said Fluff should have left a long time ago, but she loved me too much. I didn't want Fluff to go, but the lady told me it was very important. After I'd had a good cry, I told Fluff it was okay to go. I got back in bed, and Fluff settled against me for a few minutes. She was purring, making biscuits, and letting me pet her. After a little while the lady picked her up and walked out the door, thanking me for loving Fluff so much. I cried myself to sleep.

In the morning I kept crying and begged my mother to have a funeral with me. She finally did, and I have a photo of Fluff's grave, with white stones in a circle around it.

When I got married, my mother gave me the photo album she'd kept of me growing up. I was surprised to see pictures of Fluff in them—she'd even slept in my crib when I was small! Mom said she'd never seen a cat who was so gentle and affectionate with a baby, and she'd been that way with me her whole life.

After a few more pages Fluff wasn't in any more photos. I asked my mother why and why Fluff stopped letting me pet her. I thought maybe I'd been too rough and hurt or scared her.

Mom asked me what I meant, and I said Fluff wasn't in any more pictures after I was three or so. I reminded her of how Fluff would only snuggle with me at night but wouldn't come out at all during the day or let me pet her. Mother said Fluff wasn't in any more pictures because she'd gotten out and been hit by a car when I was three. I said I was glad she'd been okay, even if she was scared of people, and my mother looked at me very strangely. She said, "No, Sarah, Fluff _died_ when you were three."

Fluff might have died when I was three, but I know Fluff loved me so much she slept curled up with me every night for almost four more years.

Shelly is majoring in Computer Science. She writes:

We got my dog Tinkerbelle when I was eight years old. She was just a tiny baby, but she grew into a huge mixed breed who outweighed me within a year. She was my baby, and my mom and dad called us Shelly and Belly. She slept on my bed every night.

My mom and dad split up when I was 14, and because dad travelled a lot for work, I lived with mom. I'd go over irregularly to visit dad, but usually just for a day or two, and for his birthday and Father's day.

The year I was 16, I'd gone over to dad's for Father's day and was staying the night. I'd had a coke with dinner and was all wired up, so long after lights out I was having a hard time getting sleepy.

I'd finally gotten sleepy when I heard Belly; she went click-click-click walking up the hall, nudged the door open, click-click-clicked across the floor, and her collar jangled as she jumped up on the bed and settled in next to me. I snuggled up to her and fell right asleep.

In the morning I felt her against me as I was starting to wake up (early, because dad had to go in to work), then she was gone. I didn't hear her get down so I figured I'd fallen back asleep. I got dressed and went downstairs. Dad was drinking his coffee in the kitchen, and I asked him where she was. He laughed and said he knew I was sleepy, but I was at his house, remember? I told him she'd just been there and she'd slept with me, but he insisted I must have dreamed it, while I insisted mom must have dropped her off. I was starting to freak out, so I called mom.

Mom sounded funny. She told me she'd just been going to come get me because she had some bad news. I felt a chill and asked her if it was about Belly. Mom told me yes, that Belly had been fine when she went to bed, but when she got up Belly had died. I started to cry and begged dad to not leave until mom got there.

When mom arrived I told her about Belly coming to sleep with me, and dad told mom how sure I'd been that she'd brought Belly over without telling him.

Since Belly's death there've been two more times I've heard and felt her. The first time was the night after my best friend Sue got badly hurt a crash. I felt Belly lying against me when I was mostly asleep. I didn't remember until morning that Belly was dead. (Sue got better, but it took a long time.) The other time was the night after my Nan died. Belly came in and lied down on the bed with me when I was crying myself to sleep. Just like the time before, I didn't remember until morning that she was dead.

I'm glad she visits me. I always feel better.

Rita W. does volunteer work and enjoys time with her family. She writes:

I was at loose ends when my younger daughter started school. The local convalescent hospital needed volunteers so I signed up and enjoyed it very much. I went in from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and would help patients by delivering their flowers and cards, visiting those who were lonely or scared, playing cards or board games with those who wanted the company, and running their errands, like picking up a book from the hospital library or purchasing stationery or cards.

One of my favorite patients was Mrs. M. I don't know what was wrong with her aside from old age, but she was there when I started volunteering. She got flowers or cards almost every day, but she told me her husband was gone and her children all lived far away. Most days she was very bright and alert, but some days she would just sort of stare into space.

On her bad days I often got the feeling she was lonesome, so I would sit with her and tell her about my day, what was in the news, or what was happening on the serials she used to watch. I'd often hold her hand, and even when she didn't talk, she'd squeeze my hand when it was time for me to go.

Sometimes on her good days she'd tell me how glad she was that I was there on her bad days, so I always tried to make time for her. She had a bad spell about six months after I started working there, and during that time there were more days where she didn't seem to recognize me and didn't talk to me. On those days where she didn't know me, I still sat and talked to her, and sometimes I sang the songs she'd told me she liked.

One day I heard her voice as I came down the hall, and she sound bright and very happy. I didn't have anything to deliver that day but poked my head in her room to say I'd stop in a little later to visit, and I saw she had a visitor. I came back about an hour later, and she introduced me to her sister Mamie, who was much younger. Her sister was quiet but smiled at me as she held Mrs. M's hand. I was so glad she had family visiting and didn't want to intrude, so I excused myself after a short time. When I was getting ready to leave for the day I heard them singing a lovely song about summer and stopped to listen. The next morning I met Mrs. M.'s son for the only time. He'd been called because she had taken a sudden turn for the worse and wasn't expected to live more than a short time. I was shocked because she'd been so happy and alert the day before and now she was unconscious.

Mr. M. seemed very lost sitting with his mother, and I asked if he'd like me to sit with her for a while. He told me she'd mentioned me often and he thought she'd like to hear my voice, so we chatted while sitting with her. I mentioned the lovely song his mother had been singing Friday and sang a bit of it. Mr. M. told me it was a song his grandmother had made up; he'd grown up hearing it.

I told him how much I'd enjoyed it when his mother and aunt had been singing it together, and I mentioned how glad I was that his aunt had been able to visit while his mother was so alert.

Mr. M. told me his only aunt had died many years earlier, when he was a young man. He said he needed to go for a walk and think, so I sat with Mrs. M. and sang the song to her. I got the funniest feeling that her sister was singing to her, too, even though I couldn't hear another voice.

Mr. M. came back just before it was time for me to leave. He took a photo out of his billfold and showed it to me; it showed his mother and aunt when they were in their 30s. His aunt looked just like the Mamie that I'd met.

Tom E. is a retired doctor who's relishing his retirement. He enjoys spending time with his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He writes:

My wife loved to garden. Every year she'd organize her different garden spots: one for hummingbirds, one for butterflies, one for the kitchen, one for flowers for the house. The butterfly garden was her favorite, and she loved to spend time out there.

My wife was diagnosed with cancer when she was 64. She was a trouper, but the treatments left her very weak, and she became unable to garden. I hired someone to come over and maintain her gardens, and I'd carry her outside every day to sit in the shady nook she'd set up to watch her butterflies.

On a cool, breezy fall day in her garden, lying in my arms with all the family around her, she died.

At her funeral a butterfly made its way into the church and landed on her portrait. It sat there through the entire service before fluttering away when the service ended and people began moving.

At the cemetery three beautiful Monarchs landed on her coffin briefly before circling the family, then flying off.

My five year old great-grandson asked his mother, "Were those Grandma's butterflies?" and she told him yes. But I think it was my wife, sending me a message that she was well and happy again.

Cathy B. writes:

My grandmother loved cats and collected little cat figures, as well as things with cats on them, like teacups, coffee cups, pillows, and kitchenware.

Granny had a set of low bookshelves where she kept the figure. Every time we visited I loved to spend hours moving around the figures and making up stories about them.

Granny had a stroke while I was in Europe for an exchange year; she died two weeks later. My parents didn't think it was cost effective for me to fly home and then have to fly back again to finish school, so I missed getting to see her before she died and couldn't go to her funeral.

Granny had wanted me to have her cat figures if anything ever happened to her; she'd always told me that. Unfortunately they were sold with her other things while I was away, which I didn't find out until later.

Two days after Granny died, I was having a terrible day. I'd dreamed about Granny and been weepy all day, the usual road home was blocked for some reason, and as I went down another street, it started to pour. Then my umbrella wouldn't open, so I ducked into a little shop I'd never seen before.

It was mostly housewares, linens, clothes, and toys, but there was one shelf of knickknacks. One was a little figure of an orange tabby that looked just like one Granny had that I'd always loved. I bought it; it felt like Granny had somehow sent me to that shop.

Later that year when I was home again and looking through photos, I discovered that the figure I'd found wasn't just similar to Granny's but looked identical.

I still have it. When I see it I remember how horrible that day started as things went wrong, pushing me down a road I didn't know and into a shop I'd never visited, all to find the figure Granny wanted me to have.

**Chapter 16: Electronic Encounters**

B.P. teaches primary school. She writes:

My mother and I were always close friends as well as mother and daughter. Every year on my birthday, she'd call me at 7 p.m. to wish me a happy birthday.

When I was 24 I met K., and our first date was on my birthday. She may have been amused that I insisted on being home by 7 p.m., but she never showed it. She always insisted she was very happy to share our anniversary with my mother.

When we moved in together the next year, I told my mother I was as close to married as I was likely to get. She promptly rang K. and asked how she'd feel about being referred to as "my daughter in law"; K. was delighted.

Mother died a week before my 40th birthday and I was devastated. K. was wonderful. She asked what I wanted to do on our anniversary, and when I said I wanted to stay home, she made a wonderful dinner and spent the day holding me every time I started to weep.

We were curled up together on the bed, both half asleep while watching a movie, when the phone rang. K. answered it without thinking and no-one was there. She hung up and then we both noticed it was 7 p.m. just as the phone rang again. This time I answered it, and all I heard was static. At the same time I felt like my mother was right there, even though I couldn't see her.

For the next three years the phone rang every year for my birthday, always at 7p.m., always with static.

About that time K. and I had discussed getting rid of the land line and just using our cell phones. I dreaded the thought of missing what I always called "my mother's yearly call" and kept going back and forth.

That year at 7 p.m. the house phone didn't ring, but my cell phone did. We got rid of the land line.

K and I have been married for almost seven years now. We married on my birthday, so it's our anniversary twice over. My mother still calls at 7 p.m. every year.

J.S. is a librarian with a young daughter. She writes:

While I was pregnant in 2004, I went to see my best friend for a short visit. I was in a taxi to the train station to come home that Sunday afternoon when my phone rang. It was my grandmother, and she told me to have the taxi pull over immediately. I was embarrassed and told her I couldn't do that, but she insisted and said if I loved her, DO IT NOW, so I asked the driver to pull over. The driver told me he needed to keep the meter running, I agreed, and he pulled over. Grandma made me promise we were really stopped, then the phone went dead as soon as I gave her my word. Seconds later there was a squeal of tires up the road and the sound of a terrible crash. A truck had run a red light at the intersection and crashed into a utility pole. If we'd been in the intersection, I'm sure the taxi would have been hit.

I tried calling Grandma back, but there was no answer. I went on to the station and caught my train. When I arrived at the local station that evening, my husband picked me up. He said my mom wanted me to call as soon as I got back, so I called while we were on the way home.

Mom told me she'd gone over to check on Grandma that afternoon because she wasn't answering her phone, and Grandma had passed away. Mom had found her about the same time Grandma called me.

D.S. writes:

My partner's widowed father was opinionated, brilliant, a professed atheist, and one of the most loving men I'd ever met. My father had died when I was young, and J. treated me like a daughter for the 17 years I knew him.

J. considered all religion "hokey" and wasn't shy about saying so, although he was usually careful of others' feelings and didn't mention the subject when he thought it might hurt or upset someone.

When he was in his late 50s, he died very suddenly while on a trip. My partner and I were both devastated by the sudden loss.

J. had always said he didn't want a funeral or any of that "hokey" stuff, but if we wanted to host friends and family for a wake, well, that would be just fine with him. He even told us to feel free to raid his collection of imported whiskeys, brandies, and wines for the occasion.

So we had a wake, inviting his friends, co-workers, and family, serving all his favorite party foods, and toasting him with his own extensive collection of special wines and alcohols. Everyone shared their memories of J. and toasted him, and we all ended up laughing and crying many times during the evening.

My partner had made a mix tape of music her father had liked, and it was playing quietly in the background.

Towards the end of the evening J.'s friend L. said, "I wonder what old J. thinks now that he's dead. Was he right, or was I?" and suddenly something M. swears she never put on that tape started playing, "You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, that's what it's all about!"

It started in the middle of the song, played just that phrase, then the music M. had put on the tape continued.

People were all looking at each other and laughing, none harder than his friend L., who'd had a lifetime of J.'s rants on religion being "hokey."

We rewound that tape half a dozen times, none of us really believing it, but about 10 seconds of "The Hokey Pokey" were in the middle of the mix tape. L. commented that if J. had survived death after being so sure it was the end of existence, then he certainly must be turning himself around, and we all laughed.

It became a joke among our family and friends that when someone changed their mind, they were hokey pokeying, and we still use the term. We had that tape for 15 years before it disappeared during a move, but in my mind I can still hear L. asking his question and the song suddenly blaring out from the quiet mix tape.

This is another one of my own experiences. ~ C.A.S.

Our beautiful, long-haired black cat Sunspot came to us in December 1994 after being abandoned by neighbors who'd left him behind when they moved. He was only about 8-10 weeks old at the time and my husband and I agreed right away to adopt him. Paul christened him "Sunspot" and we called him Sunny or Puppy; he was very much a puppy in a cat suit and loved to follow us around and sing in a chirpy little voice.

When he was 14 he was diagnosed with metastasised adenocarcinoma; the metastases were on his toe pads and the prognosis was very poor: several weeks to several months at best.

A few days later I stumbled across an article about turkey tail mushrooms and cancer, so I ordered some to add to his food. Within a few weeks the tumors started falling off and pretty soon he was bouncing around again.

He had two good years before he started failing in the summer of 2010, although we missed the signs at first. He'd forget where he was and pee where he was sleeping, curl up on my footstool out of sight, then one day he didn't want to go downstairs to eat. After that he stayed upstairs all the time. He ate well and was his usual loving self for several weeks, then one day he didn't want to eat anymore. He told me he wanted to die naturally at home. I did my best to honor that, although it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

His last night I'd gotten ready for bed when I felt the need to get back up and cuddle him for a while. I took him downstairs to the glider and cuddled him against me for about 20 minutes. He purred softly for a few minutes, then had a seizure and went stiff. I brought him upstairs and woke Paul, and Sunspot passed over with the people who loved him petting him and telling him it was fine to go.

About 10 minutes later, I heard his familiar chirp and jumped, then I heard it again and the lights flickered. I realized his chirp was actually the surge protector, but instead of beeping repeatedly the way it usually did, it was single chirps, just like Sunny's voice. The lights flickered again and the surge protector chirped again, and I started laughing through my tears. I told Sunny out loud that I was glad he'd transitioned and how much I loved him; I know it was him telling me goodbye.

**Chapter 17: Other Encounters**

E.C. is an administrative assistant with a partner and adult twin daughters. She writes:

I grew up hearing my grandmother's story about her twin uncles, James and John. James had gone to Arizona to work, while John stayed in Washington with the family. One day John collapsed and said he'd had a terrible pain in his chest. His wife said he said "James?", although he always denied it. She called the doctor who could find nothing wrong. That night the phone rang, and it was James' wife, telling him James had died that afternoon of a heart attack, the same time John had collapsed.

I'd always thought that was a romantic story but unlikely to be true. Then two years ago one of my daughters was badly hurt during a rafting accident. She struck her head and almost drowning. My other daughter was at home and we were in the garden. Suddenly Jaime sat down and said very loudly, "No! Jen, come back!" and fainted. We found out later it happened at the same time Jen was being resuscitated. Neither of them recalls anything about it. Jen only remembers waking at the hospital, and Jaime only remembers getting dizzy in the garden.

Jen's fine now, but sometimes I wonder if she'd still be with us if her twin sister hadn't called her back. (I've changed both their names for their privacy.)

**BONUS!**

I hope you'll enjoy the following story from my new book, _Angelic Encounters: True Stories of Angelic Protection, Assistance, and Comfort_ , published August 2012.

Kate T. is a teacher at a satellite school. She has three adult children, two grandchildren, two cats, a dog, and four fish. She writes:

I was seven, Lori was four, and Peggy was almost ten when this happened. We lived in a poor part of town where there were no sidewalks, only dirt and rocks. There were a few run down apartment houses, but there were mostly very small wooden houses.

Our house was in a court of six houses built around a paved spot for parking. Looking back the houses were very tiny, but I didn't know anything different. We kids shared a bed in one bedroom, and Mama and Papa had a tiny bedroom. There was a small bathroom with a shower, sink, and toilet, and one side of the living room had a counter and a stove, refrigerator, and sink.

Mama and Papa had a little store about six blocks away. Peggy and I always picked up Lori from our aunt's apartment when we got out of school. The three of us were home alone until Mama came home to make supper at 6. Mama went back after supper to help Papa until the store closed at 9. We had good neighbors on both sides and we all knew to go to them if we needed anything or if we just got spooked or scared being home alone.

One night Peggy was still reading in bed, and Lori and I were asleep, when a strange lady came right in the front door. She told Peggy to wake us up and get us dressed because we had to go to the store right away. Peggy got us up and dressed, and the lady walked us to the store but didn't come in. Mama and Papa were surprised to see us and angry at us for staying up so late. Peggy kept telling them about the lady but they didn't believe her.

It was just after closing time by then, so they finished up and we all walked home together. There were sirens in the distance and they got louder the closer we got to home. Papa told us to stay with Mama and ran ahead to see what was happening, then came running back. He talked quietly to Mama for a minute, then he turned us around and took us all back to the store. Papa went out again and came back with some blankets and pillows. He told us we were going to camp out in the store for a few days. About a week later we moved into a new house that was on the other side of the store in a nicer neighborhood. We girls still shared a room, but we each had our own beds and the kitchen and living rooms were separate rooms. We even went to a different school.

I didn't find out until I was eleven that there was a fire in the court that night. All the houses were destroyed, several people were hospitalized, and three children who were home alone and asleep died. When Papa came back it was because the firemen wouldn't let anyone close. He went back the next day and found only smoking rubble where our house had been. All the houses were so old and badly made they'd burned like paper. We lost everything. Papa told me once that picked a new neighborhood far away in the other direction so Lori and I wouldn't find out that some of our friends had died in the fire, although he and Mama went to the funeral. He asked Peggy to not tell us until we were older, and she never said a word to me about it until I asked her about it.

I don't know why my sisters and I were spared while the other children died, and it still bothers me sometimes. I remember so clearly that walk in the dark night and holding hands with the lady we didn't know. She looked a little like Mama or Aunt Rosa, with dark, glossy hair, and she talked like them, too. But we never saw her again. Mama and Papa called her our guardian angel.

Kate T.
