 
### Wicked Redemption

Lady Christine Denton sat on her flowered setae, her back straight and rigid barely touching the seat itself. The crumpled blackmail note was in her lap. She was grateful that Mrs. Hunter was not there to witness her reaction to the letter, tears still streaked Christine's face. The only person who knew she was being blackmailed was her dear friend Matthew Fullcroft. He suggested they marry, and he could protect her and her son. Christine had politely declined. He was a good friend, but she wanted more than that. She wanted the love that her late husband shared with Matthew, not another long-term friendship.

Christine had given her butler strict instructions to turn away all visitors today, she was in no mood to face her friends. The sitting room door opened, and Eddie White bounced in the room. Eddie, much younger than Mrs. Hunter, was a good twenty years older than Christine. Eddie's curly platinum hair always managed to escape whatever coif she had. Her eyes bright and mischievous as she smiled widely at Christine.

"Good morning, my lady. The butler told me that he would not be disturbing you today, I let him know that I could find my own way around." She smiled. She looked at Christine's tear-stained face and stopped in her tracks. "Oh dear," She said as she crossed the room to Christine. Eddie sat next to her and held the lady's hand. "Whatever could make you cry?" Eddie rubbed the back of Christine's hand. Christine whimpered as she handed Eddie the note. Eddie scanned the note quickly. "This is rubbish, who would believe such a lie?" Eddie huffed.

"It's true." Christine sniveled. She covered her face. "My husband had a lover. His name is Matthew Fullcroft. We kept it a secret. Fredrick and I, we thought we were so careful."

"Even the part about little Freddy?" Eddie asked.

"No. Frederick is really his father. That was our deal. We conceive one son and then I could have anyone I wanted for a lover as long as I was discreet. But there was never anyone else. I thought there were only three of us that knew anything."

"Don't pay any attention to this and it will all go away." Eddie patted Christine's hand.

"This isn't the first letter I received." Christine replied. "I received it weeks ago. They said that they would send a letter to Fredrick's cousin if I didn't respond. Now his cousin is questioning Freddy's legitimacy. Eddie, I don't know what I'm going to do? I can't prove that Freddy is legitimate. We will lose everything." She cried.

Eddie stood up quickly. "I'm going to fix this." She said.

"Eddie, what on earth could you do?"

"Don't worry, dearie, I'm going to take care of everything."

Eddie ran out of the room and out of the Denton home. She didn't stop until she was home. Without hesitating, Eddie barged into James Deacon's office. It was the one room in the house that they had agreed she would stay out of.

"We had an agreement, woman." James grumbled. He stood at his window staring out into the street. Stacks of papers were on top of his desk, books littered the floor. A stale cigar was smoldering in a filthy ashtray on his desk.

"Fix this." Eddie shouted, shoving the note in James' direction.

James took the note out of Eddie's hands and read over it. "Does she know who's blackmailing her?"

"No." Eddie replied.

"What do you think I can do about it. I won't pay blackmail for myself."

"Has anyone ever tried to blackmail you?"

"Who would dare?" James snorted.

"See, that's what I mean. No one would dare do that to you. You can take care of this."

"What on earth do you expect me to do?" He shouted at her.

"Let people know that she is your friend. Then she will be left alone." Eddie smiled

"No one would believe that. I don't have friends." He said. He thought for a moment, he had no intention of paying Lady Denton's blackmailer, but he did have an idea, one that Lady Denton might find disagreeable. A smile crept upon his face as he thought of the lovely widow. Without a word, he rushed past Eddie, leaning on his cane as he walked.

"It's not my fault you don't have friends." Eddie shouted at him. She followed him into the hall.

"Eddie!" James shouted as he turned around to face her. She jumped. James placed his large hands on the small woman's shoulders. "Can you not pester me for the next hour?"

"I do not pester...." Eddie paused and tilted her head to the side as she thought. "Alright, I will leave you alone for the next hour. But you promised me you would take care of this."

"I promised nothing of the sort." James groaned as he put on his coat. His cane was propped in the corner by the front door. It was a dark cherry wood inlaid with gold leafing. A large round crystal bauble sat on the top. It had belonged to his late father, a gift from Eddie.

James limped with his cane down the street. Most people scrambled out of his way. His clothing was rumpled, his hair was unkempt, and he had several days' growth of beard. He looked more like a demon than a wealthy lord. Arriving at Lady Denton's home, James banged on the front door with his cane. The butler answered and gave him the same line he had given Eddie about Lady Denton not seeing anyone today. James pushed passed the man, he remembered his way to the sitting room where they first met. He remembered clearly how lovely and pale she was, her smooth chestnut hair arraigned in neat coils at the nape of her neck. She was too beautiful to hideaway. He opened the door to see Christine sitting in the same spot. Her eyes were lined with dark circles, and her face was tear-stained.

"Why won't anyone leave me be today." Christine cried.

"Is this true?" He pulled the letter out of his coat pocket and handed it back to her. She nodded her head taking the letter back.

"Everything is true. Except my husband is the father of our child. That was our arrangement. I give him an heir, and he gave me freedom." She kept her eyes on her lap.

"Have you paid them anything?"

"No." she shuddered.

"Good, don't do anything." He said.

"But they've already gone to my late husband's cousin and told him the child isn't legitimate. I don't know what to do?" James reached out, touching her chin with his fingertips and lightly tipping it up, forcing her to look at him.

"Marry me." James said quickly, withdrawing his hand.

"What?"

"I thought I was clear. Marry me. People are too afraid of me to do anything to you. And if they want to challenge your son's legitimacy, you and your son will be cared for."

"W-w-what do you want from me in return?" Her voice was shaky.

"Nothing." He said.

"I don't understand, Lord Prescott. What do you gain by this match?"

"I said nothing. There is absolutely nothing that I want that you could possibly give me." He growled.

"I'm still not sure why you would do this for me." She replied.

"Just say yes. And I will take care of you and your child."

"What about Mrs. Hunter. She goes where I go."

"Fine." He grunted. "Bring whoever she is. I'll care for her as well."

"Another marriage of convenience." She sighed. "Yes." Christine said weakly.

James paused, unable to move. He did not believe it would be that easy to convince the lady to wed him. He took a breath. "Good." He said. "Let's get this done quickly. How soon can you be ready to leave?" He asked sharply.

"I, um, I'm not sure." Christine replied.

"Be ready by Sunday." He said.

"But that is in three days." She protested.

"The sooner this is done the sooner you will be under my protection."

Christine nodded and stood up. "Will you be expecting...." She paused as her cheeks turned bright pink.

James waited for a moment until he realized what she was asking him. The thought of the woman in his bed made him smile for the second time that afternoon. "I will not force you to come to me. That will be your choice."

She breathed a sigh of relief; she closed her eyes and placed a hand on her heart. "Thank you, my lord."

"Don't thank me." He replied. "And my name is James." James turned to leave. "Sunday, seven in the evening. You will be on my doorstep with whomever you are taking from your household." He shouted on his way out.

Mrs. Hunter came in from the kitchen. "What was that all about?" She quested Christine.

"I believe I just made a deal with the devil." Christine replied softly.

James returned home to find an eager Eddie pacing in his office.

"I thought we discussed that this room was off-limits to you." He grumbled.

"You never leave here, and I wanted to find out what happened. Are you able to help her?"

"Of course." He replied.

"And?" She asked. Eddie's hands were clasped under her chin.

"She and I will wed on Sunday evening. She will be moving here with her family."

"You'd do all that?" Eddie asked smiling wide.

"Thank your daughter for putting such a stupid idea into my head." James said remembering his first meeting with the lady. 'You fancy her.' Pearl had said to him on their ride back home.

"You mean your sister." Eddie hummed.

"She disinherited me a long time ago." James mumbled. He turned to look at her, he waited for Eddie to twist the knife and offer a little dig. She was silent.

"I'll leave you alone." Eddie hummed softly as she left James alone in his office.

*************************************************************************************

Sunday night at exactly seven pm, Christine knocked gently on Lord Prescott's door. Her young son, Freddy, gripped her free hand.

Mrs. Hunter rested a hand on Christine's shoulder. "Are you sure you want to go through with this?" She asked Christine softly.

"It's my best option right now to help my son." Christine replied.

"Are you sure?" Mrs. Hunter asked again. "What about Amelia. She would take you both in. And Lord Southerton would help you as well."

"I don't wish to burden my family with this," Christine said.

"Lord Fullcroft made you an offer as well. You could have married him. Why this man?" Mrs. Hunter asked. Christine rarely disagreed with her companion, but she offered Mrs. Hunter a glare. "It was just a suggestion. We could leave now."

"I've made up my mind." Christine said knocking again.

Eddie opened the door, the grin wide on her face. "You're here. I'm so excited." She rushed out the door and wrapped her arms around Christine. "I'm so glad."

"Eddie, let them in." James shouted from the stairs. "I want to get this started." He grumbled as he walked into the sitting room.

Christine and her small family followed Eddie inside to the sitting room. James was waiting with the minister. She looked her future husband over, his clothing was neat and pressed, his hair was combed, and he was neatly shaved. He was handsome. She smiled weakly and walked up the makeshift aisle to him and resigned herself to another loveless marriage. Christine repeated her vows and waited for the quick cold kiss to seal her fate. When the minister said, "You may kiss the bride." Christine felt James' lips touch hers, they were soft and warm. His arms wrapped around her, she felt a tingle inside her, causing her to lean into his body. Before she could explore the feeling, James pulled away.

"Excuse me, I have things to do." James limped away with his cane. "Eddie, explain to everyone my rules." He shouted as he headed to his office, slamming the door behind him.

"No one is allowed inside his lordship's office." Eddie smiled. "I do have a spare set of keys to everything. Including his lordship's office." She grinned heading up the steps. "Come along and I'll show you around." She sang. Christine and Mrs. Hunter looked at each other and followed Eddie up the steps.

"I think I'll take Freddy up to his room and put him to bed," Christine said glancing at the little boy at her side. The little boy stayed silent.

"What a good little boy he is," Eddie said. "Would you like me to take him." Eddie held out her hand and the boy ducked behind his mother's skirt frantically gripping the fabric in his small hands.

"Freddy is a little shy in new places," Christine replied. "I think it's best if I take care of him." Eddie nodded and showed the trio around the upstairs of the house.

Alone with her son, Christine tucked the little boy into bed.

"Mummy, who is that man downstairs?" He asked.

"That is Lord Prescott, and he is mummy's new husband. He promised to take care of us."

"When do we get to go home?" He asked.

"This is our new home. We stay with Lord Prescott."

"But I miss my old home. I don't want to stay here."

"I know, but we will stay here." Christine leaned down and kissed her son before getting up to leave.

Slowly, Christine climbed down the steps to her room. Her head was aching, and she only wanted to rest; she rang the bell in her room to have someone help her undress. No one came. Unbuttoning her dress, she took care of dressing herself for bed, finding a thin nightgown on her bed. She pulled the hairpins from her hair, running her fingers through her locks to loosen the curl. The room was chilly, no fire was lit for her. She rang the bell again to have someone come and light her fireplace. Still, no one came. She heard her husband pacing his bedchamber. Knocking on his door, she hoped he would help her light the fire.

************************************************************************************

James slammed his door shut to his room. He paced a bit before he sat in the silence of his bedchamber. The new Lady Prescott was in the adjoining bedchamber. He still could not believe that the lovely woman had agreed to become his wife. He had told the lady she could come and go as she pleased, he would not force her into his bed. The more he thought of the slender lady and her silken tresses the more he regretted his words. A light knock sounded on the connecting door.

"Enter." He shouted. Christine entered his chamber wearing only a thin nightgown. Every delicate curve was visible through the fabric. The woman did not hide anything from his site.

"My lord, the fire has gone out in my room and I am unable to get it to light. It seems that you have no servants here who can relight it."

"James." He growled.

"What?" she asked.

"Did you call your first husband Lord Denton?"

"No, but Freddy took time to get to know me before he proposed." She said smartly.

"But he still lied to you about his true nature."

"How dare you speak of Freddy that way." She shouted at him. "Freddy and I had an understanding. We were friends. My agreement with you is much different, my lord." Her brow was wrinkled as she frowned at him.

James rose from his worn chair and crossed the room to stand directly in front of his wife. Although the lady was considered tall, James still towered over her. He grinned he didn't expect the woman to have a sharp tongue. He liked this side of her. He continued to leer at her, Christine trembled. "I'm changing the terms of our agreement, Christine." He snarled.

"You can't do that." Her voice shook.

"I do what I like." He pulled her into his arms pressing her body into his. James ran his hands up and down her back.

"Lord Prescott, you said you wouldn't force me."

James silenced her with a kiss. Gently he prodded her, nibbling at her lower lip with his teeth teasing her with his tongue. Christine opened her mouth and James slipped his tongue in tasting her. She groaned James pulled away and he smiled again.

"I said I wouldn't force you into my bed, but I never said I wouldn't try to seduce you." He laughed.

"You wouldn't dare." Her eyes were wide.

James kissed her neck and she gasped. He nibbled on her earlobe. "I dare to do a lot of things, my lovely."

Christine sucked in her breath. "I won't ever love you." She hissed.

He laughed again. "I don't expect you to love me." James stood straight and grabbed the front of Christine's gown ripping it in two. She stood there in shock, her eyes wide and her mouth open as the torn fabric slid from her shoulders and pooled at her feet. He smiled as he gazed at her naked body. He grabbed her again, holding her up against him with one arm wrapped around her waist. James caressed her cheek with the back of his hand running his thumb over her swollen lip. "I expect you to love it when I touch your body." He ran his hand between her breasts, down her belly, and he reached between her thighs. Finding her little nub of flesh, he began to rub it making her grow damp. Her breath came in fast waves as he stroked her. "I expect you to love it when I suck on your breast." He angled her bending her slightly backward and captured her breast with his mouth, sucking and nibbling on the rosebud nipple.

"Oh, dear God." She gasped running her fingers through James' hair. He slid his fingers inside her slick center. He stopped suckling her breast and watched her face as he slid his fingers in and out. Her body tightened as she groaned, the lady closed her eyes. Feeling her orgasm in his hand he pulled his fingers out of her. When she opened her eyes, he licked her cream from his fingers.

"I expect you to love it when my cock enters you every night. I expect you to willingly bend over my desk as I shove myself inside you every afternoon. I expect you to come running to me eagerly when I call because you love everything that I do to you. You want my protection and I want your body." He grinned as Christine shivered. "That's the new price of our agreement. You don't have to love me Christine, but you will want me, and you will give me your body."

Christine's cheeks were flushed, her hair hung loosely down her back. He stared at her longingly and he could feel himself stiffen. She said nothing to him, no protest or begging him to take her. 'Damn it, woman, say something.' He thought to himself. He wanted her badly, but he did not want to force her.

"Go to bed, Christine." He shouted at her. James expected his bride to run to her room, instead, she walked over to his bed and climbed under the covers.

"Please don't yell at me when we...." She spoke softly, her voice trailing off.

James smiled, his bride was willing to let him bed her. He quickly undressed; her eyes widened as his erection was freed from his trousers. She pulled the covers up to her chin. James ripped them from her hands.

"You don't need those. I'll keep you warm." He laid down on top of her, he wanted to feel her, but he needed to take his time with Christine. He kissed her neck and chest, slowly trailing kisses down her belly. "Christine." He breathed as he kissed her. Gently he spread her legs kissing the mound of quivering flesh. Flicking his tongue against her nub, Christine groaned. Lapping at her cream, James slid his fingers inside her again. She moaned wildly as she had another release. Christine was wet and ready for him, James could not wait a moment longer. He thrust himself into her felling her tight dampness surround him. James pulled up her legs to thrust himself into her deeper.

"Oh James." She groaned. Christine shuddered, and James felt her orgasm around him.

James couldn't hold back any longer, he had wanted her since the first moment he saw her. He thrust into her faster as Christine groaned loudly. James silenced her with a kiss as they both found a release together. "Christine" he breathed kissing her again. She ran her fingers through his damp hair. He rolled off her and held Christine in his arms, gently stroking the hair from her forehead. He held her in his arms and kissed her brow.

"Are you still cold, my beauty?" He asked as he held her tightly.

"No." She breathed sleepily. Christine laid her head on his chest, closed her eyes, and fell asleep in his arms.

Gingerly, James reached for the covers he had pushed away. He pulled them up, wrapping his beauty in their warmth. James watched her sleep, she clung to him and his chest ached. The last time he felt that ache was with Margarete. He told that woman he loved her, and she had pushed him down a flight of stairs. He loved Christine from the moment he first met her. She was kind and patient with Eddie. She was devoted to her only son. She was loyal to her elderly housekeeper, treating the woman like a mother. Christine was everything he was not, gentle sweet and pure. Forcing her to marry him for protection made him no better than the bastard that was blackmailing her. He would give her an out, in the morning he would change their agreement again. This time he would make a binding contract.

*************************************************************************************

Christine awoke the next morning buried in the old blankets on her husband's bed. A note was placed on the pillow next to her. She picked it up and read James' neat script.

"I will not force you to come to me again. I am sorry."

Her cheeks warmed as she thought of James' hands on her body the previous night. The way he felt inside her, the way he touched her, Christine did not want to give that up. Her late husband cared for her, but he did not do any of those things to her that James had done. She decided to get dressed and meet her husband in his office and make a few changes to their arrangement herself.

Fully dressed and standing in front of the office door, Christine waited for James to look up at her. She cleared her throat and he picked up his head from his work.

"What." He said sharply.

"I found the note." She replied, holding it in her hand. Christine stepped into his office, shutting the door behind her. Carefully she twisted the lock on the doorknob, hoping he didn't hear.

"Here." He held out a document for her to read. Christine took the paper and read through it. "You can go where you like, you don't have to stay here. I will give you a monthly stipend to spend as you wish. I won't ask any questions."

Christine tore the paper in half and handed it back to him. "I have another suggestion."

"I don't understand. I thought this would be agreeable to you?" He muttered.

"It is, my lord." She said, James growled. "James," She corrected herself. "but let me give you an heir." She paused to study his reaction. "If that would be agreeable to you."

"You understand what that would entail?" He asked her.

"Yes, James. I understand what my duty would be." She nodded.

"Duty," he grumbled. "You make it sound like a chore."

"No!" She shouted. He looked up at her in surprise. "No, James." She placed a hand on his shoulder and smiled shyly. Christine moved her hand to her throat and unbuttoned the buttons on her collar. Her hands moving vigorously as she tore at her buttons, exposing her bare breasts. James stared at his wife, mouth open as she gathered her skirts and sat on his lap. Both of her hands ran through his hair, pulling his mouth to hers. Christine slipped her tongue into his mouth, tasting his smoky flavor.

James pulled away and trailed kisses along her jawline leading to her ear. "Tell me I'm not a chore." His voice a low hungry growl in her ear. He nibbled lightly at her earlobe.

"You are not a chore." She gasped as James kissed her neck.

"Do you want me to make love to you?" He asked.

"Yes." Her voice was breathless.

"Tell me, Christine. Tell me you want me." He breathed in her ear. Christine shivered.

"James," she whispered. "I want you. Make love to me." James scraped his teeth along the delicate curve of her neck.

"Tell me what you want me to do to you." His face still buried in her neck, but she could feel his lips turn to a smile. Her breath was rapid as her heart raced.

"I," She breathed. "I want," Words escaping her as she tried to form a coherent sentence. Last night was the first time she had felt desirable and she did not want to give it up.

"Tell me what you want me to do to you, Christine. Or I will send you back up to your room with nothing at all." He chided.

"You lie." She responded grinding her hips on his lap. She could feel his arousal through his breeches.

"Is my wife calling me a liar? That could be dangerous for you, Christine." Although his tone was serious, Christine could hear lust in his voice.

"I call you a liar because you are one." She looked into his eyes and saw the surprise on his face. No one challenged him. She smiled and bit her lower lip. "I can feel your desire for me." She wiggled herself again, watching his reaction to her. His breath was rapid, her hands still around his neck. "I want your tongue to taste all of me. I want your hands teasing my breasts and between my legs. I want to feel you deep inside me. And I want to do the same for you. I want to taste you." Christine leaned in, instead of kissing him she ran her tongue along his bottom lip sucking it into her mouth. "I want to touch and explore your body. And if you refuse me, I will torment and tease you till you give me exactly what I desire."

James didn't wait for her to say another word. He picked her up from his lap and laid her down atop his desk. Pushing up her skirts, revealing that Christine was wearing nothing underneath her dress. He spread her legs apart wide and gently ran his fingers down her belly and between her legs, sliding his fingers inside her. Christine moaned loudly.

"Is this what you wanted inside you?" He asked as he ran his thumb across her sensitive nub of flesh. Christine thrust her hips up as she clenched around his fingers inside her. Waves of delight crashed over her.

"No," She gasped. "I need," She tried to think of the word she had heard used. She moaned again while James continued to play with her. "I want your cock in me." She groaned. Christine opened her eyes to see James smiling down at her.

"Where did such an innocent lady learn a dirty word like that."

"I know a few dirty words." She smiled. "And I want you inside me, now."

James pulled his hand from between her legs and showed it to her. His fingers were covered in her nectar. "Do you know what this is from?" He asked her. Christine nodded her head as she sat up. She grabbed his wrist, pulling it to her mouth and licked the cream from his fingers. She heard him suck in his breath. Christine reached for the front of his pants and undid the buttons letting them fall. Sliding from the desktop, Christine knelt in front of her husband. Opening her mouth, she flicked her tongue across his cock. Christine took him in her mouth, gently sucking and running her tongue the length of him. When she heard him groan, she knew she was doing the right thing.

Christine felt James entwine his fingers through her hair. He yanked her head back and off him.

"It seems my sweet and innocent wife is much more wicked and wonton than she originally led me to believe." James trailed a finger down her jaw. She panted. "I told you I would have you begging for me." She grabbed at his free hand, bringing it to her mouth and biting lightly at his palm. "What would you like from me, my beauty?" His voice shaking.

"Sit down." She commanded him. He let go of her hair and sat down in his chair. Christine pushed herself up from the floor. Straddling his lap, Christine slowly slid herself down onto him. Her mouth slightly open and her breath heavy, Christine rocked her hips grinding herself on top of him, her eyes locking onto his. Picking up her momentum, Christine's breath quickened. James' grip tightened around her waist.

"James," She moaned.

"Yes, my lady." He reached up to her back, grabbed her hair, pulling and tilting her head back as he covered her bare chest in kisses. She cried out. "Tell me what you want from me." He breathed.

Christine felt her body vibrate; she pulled her hair from James' grasp. Crushing her mouth to his, Christine began to shudder as she pulsated around her husband's cock. "I want this." She breathed heavily, bucking her hips. "All the time."

James wrapped his arms around her waist, tightening his grip he buried his face in her cleavage. She felt his breath deep before his body relaxed. She wasn't sure, but she thought she heard him whimper softly. "Do you wish to stay?" He asked.

"You make me feel desirable, James." Christine smiled as her fingers gently combed through his hair.

"That does not answer my question, Christine." His voice still soft, but stern. "Any man can make you feel desirable. Do you wish to stay with me?"

"I don't understand." She replied. "I like how you make me feel."

"You want to give me an heir?" James asked, his voice tight. Christine slowly nodded, her brows drew together in confusion. "Fine, you can stay till you give me an heir. Then you and the children will leave."

"But I thought...."

"Go to the country, stay in London, go to the south of France for all I care." James grabbed her by the arms, freeing himself from her embrace. He shook her lightly. "You will leave when this heir nonsense is done."

"James...."

"I don't need a silly wife in my home and I don't want children running around touching everything." He growled. "Now get yourself out of my office."

Christine pushed herself from his lap and ran sobbing from his office while clutching her blouse closed. She had left open his office door. He quickly redressed himself, he stood to watch her leave.

Eddie was walking down the hallway when she witnessed Christine running from James' office.

"You idiot. Why is she crying?" Eddie shouted at him.

"Ask her. I've given her what she wanted."

Eddie stomped her feet as she marched to James' desk, his fancy cane was propped along the side of the desk. Eddie picked it up and whacked James in the leg. He jumped back and stared at Eddie. She had raised his cane over her head, James quickly scrambled out of her way.

"What is wrong with you, woman? Why are you trying to bash my brains in?" He shouted at her.

"You made that lovely woman cry." She hollered back. "You deserve to be beaten."

"Don't involve yourself in our argument." He shouted as he continued to scramble out of her way.

"You don't deserve her." She screamed at the top of her lungs.

James ran behind Eddie, wrapped his arms around her, and squeezed her tight. "You are right." He said. "I don't deserve her."

"Then what do you intend to do about it?" Eddie replied as she tried to wiggle free.

He relaxed his grip on her but grabbed his cane out of her grasp. James walked over to his desk and opened his drawer pulling out a slip of paper. Scribbling a quick note, he handed her the paper. "Here." He said. "Take this to the bank, they will give you money. Take the lady anywhere she desires. Buy her whatever she wants, no matter how silly it is." Eddie looked at the note and wrinkled her nose. She looked up at James to make sure she read it correctly. "No one will accept my credit anymore. I have to have others procure things for me, and it has to be paid for upfront."

"You can't buy her affection," Eddie smirked as she tried to hand the paper back to him.

James pushed her hand back toward her. "I know. Margarette taught me that. But I need to make amends to Christine and I'm not sure where to start."

"A simple 'I'm sorry' would do." She huffed as she turned to leave the office.

"Do you think that would work?" He asked her.

Eddie turned around to look at him, he seemed genuinely concerned. She shrugged. "Don't know, but we'll have fun spending your money." Eddie smiled as she left.

"That woman really will kill me one day." He muttered to himself.

James stepped into his hallway and saw Eddie passing Christine's companion on the staircase. He was sure the woman had a few words for him as well.

"You, woman," James grumbled in his gruff voice.

"I have a name." Mrs. Hunter replied sternly. "And I am not your servant."

James stood still for a moment and tried his best to recall her name. "Mrs. Hunter." He said, more politely this time. "Would you be able to contact Lady Prescott's former servants. Offer them employment here. Tell them I will triple their previous salary."

"I do not work for you." She huffed as she crossed her arms. James was sure she was aware of the argument he had with his wife.

"Please, I will give you anything. Whatever you want." He pleaded.

"Alright." Mrs. Hunter stepped around him to continue walking.

"What is it that you want?" he asked her.

"I'll let you know." She replied and continued down the steps.

James passed his wife's chamber. Eddie was already sitting by her side comforting her.

"I know he's beastly, dear. We can go spend his money." Eddie quipped.

"I don't care about his money." His bride cried in Eddie's arms. Eddie glanced up at James. He scurried out the way.

"Come with me, dearie. Freddie is occupied, and I believe Mrs. Hunter has found something to occupy her time. Let's get out of the house. Get some fresh air, enjoy the day. I'm sure you won't have to see your beastly husband for the rest of the day. Maybe you won't have to see him until tomorrow if you're lucky?"

James hid in his room, waiting for Christine and Eddie to leave. Once he was sure the ladies were gone, James ran out of his hiding place. He found his one loyal servant, stopping the old man in his duties.

"I need you to remove Lady Prescott's bed from her chamber."

"Where would you like it moved to, my lord?" The servant questioned.

"Throw it out, chop it up for firewood, I don't care, just move it from my home," James replied.

"My lord?" The confused servant questioned. "Where will the lady sleep?"

James took a deep breath, he did not like being questioned. "She will sleep with me. Please remove her bed. Hire help if you need too. I will make sure you and anyone that assists you are compensated."

"Understood, sir." The servant replied.

************************************************************************************

James sat in his room; it felt like an eternity waiting for Christine to return home. He read the paper, read books he forgot about, but ultimately, he resigned to pacing his chamber to wait for Christine to return. He paused when he heard the door to his wife's room open, he waited for the woman to come to him and knock on his door. Their adjoining door flew open and Christine stormed through.

"Where is it?" She shouted. "Is this some sort of punishment, now? I don't answer questions properly and you will take my things away?"

"Actually, Christine, the bed belonged to me."

"You bastard." She shouted. Christine rushed at him, fists clenched, and she raised her arm prepared to strike.

James grabbed her, pinning her arms to her side as he pulled her close to him. "My delicate flower; aren't you full of surprises. I expected more tears, possibly some begging. But not this." Christine thrashed in his arms, he pushed her back up against a wall. "I enjoy this." He grinned. James pushed himself into her body, forcing her legs apart.

"Let go of me." She growled trying to push her body away from the wall.

"You're mine, beauty." He smiled. She wasn't backing down from him. The tears from earlier this morning were replaced with a fierce rage. He pushed his growing erection into her. Her hair was coming loose from her beautifully coiled knot hanging around her shoulders. "I like you like this, angry and fierce."

"I hate you." She hissed between clenched teeth.

"I believe you do." He leaned in, his mouth capturing hers. James shuddered, feeling her teeth graze his lips. Their tongues touching, her hips pushing into his stiff cock. "Hate me more, beauty." James released her hands, her fingers immediately intertwining through his hair, her mouth claiming his.

James reached under her skirts, pulling down her undergarments sliding them off her legs letting them fall the floor. He slid his fingers inside her feeling her slick wet center. He unbuttoned his trousers and thrust his cock inside her. The lady moaned loudly, her hips bucking against him. He felt her excitement grow before she clenched around him. James pulled himself out, Christine whimpered. Gingerly, James lifted Christine walking slowly to his bed, the bed he wanted to share with his bride. Laying her down, James unbuttoned Christine's blouse. Christine lifted her hips and undid the buttons and claps on her skirt. James pulled her clothing off, leaving her only in stocking and corset.

"You're beautiful like this." He lifted her hips, driving himself deep inside her. Christine's fingers grasping the covers on his bed. James reached between her legs, his thumb rubbing her nub of flesh. Christine writhed underneath him. "Cum for me Christine." Christine sucked in a sharp breath before letting out a loud groan. "Now, Christine." He growled. Her body trembling under his command. James felt her throb and slicken around him before he lost all control, squeezing his eyes shut. The lady's breath slowed, and her body stopped quaking under him. He opened his eyes; the lady's face was serene and angelic. Christine gazed at him; her expression soft.

"I love how you hate me." He caressed her cheek. Christine turned away from him. James tilted her chin back. "No, don't turn away from me." He said.

"You shout at me, torment me, treat me like an object..."

"You are not an object, other than an object of beauty."

"I am no beauty. I am too tall and too thin."

"You are my sweet beautiful wife. And I'm sorry for earlier. I should have not acted the way I did."

"Then why did you take away my bed?" Christine asked, pushing herself up on her elbows.

"Because I was hoping that you would share mine." He replied.

"Why didn't you ask me?"

"I am a willful and spiteful man that insists on doing things the hard way. Or at least that is what Eddie always told my father." He replied. Christine drew her eyebrows together. "I don't know, Christine. I don't know why I did it the way I did. I know that you are beautiful and kind and I in no way deserve to be in your presence." He said pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Our agreement still stands. You and Freddy may leave once we have an heir."

"But..."

"I won't keep you here like a caged animal. You are too good for me."

"I should go check on Freddy." She said pushing off the bed. She grabbed her discarded clothing, quickly dressing.

"I, I'd like to meet him." James replied. "If that is alright with you."

"He's very shy, he doesn't speak to people unless he knows them well."

"Good, I'll go up to meet you in the nursery."

"No, it takes him time to warm up to people. The sooner he gets to know you, the better. I'll bring him down to you."

James smiled and let his wife dress. "I'll meet you in the library." He watched Christine leave and got himself dressed.

James waited in his library, a room he hadn't entered in years. He remembered sneaking in as a child to flip through his father's books. A light knock on the door made him turn. Christine stood in the doorway, a terrified little boy clutched at her hand. James tried his best to smile at the boy, he ducked behind his mother.

"Freddy, this is Lord Prescott." Christine said.

James took a step forward. Freddy clutched his mother's hand tighter. James cleared his throat. "My name is James." He said glancing at the little boy. "And you look a lot like your father." Freddy peaked from behind Christine's skirt, still silent. "And if you should need anything, you can usually find me in my office." James stepped closer, Freddy jumped and hid behind his mother again. He looked up at Christine. "You can take him back to the nursery if he would like."

Freddy let go of Christine's hand and ran out of the room. Christine glanced back. "I told you he is shy around people he doesn't know."

"And I'm not the friendliest of people." James grunted.

"I didn't say that." Christine protested.

"You don't have to. It's a known fact."

Christine stared at her husband and smiled a little before she looked back down at the floor. "I'm glad you've started shaving and combing your hair." She looked back up to see James grinning. Christine turned around and left the room without a word.

Still grinning, James left his library and headed for his office. He found Mrs. Hunter standing outside his door. She was holding a folded slip of paper in her hands.

"Mrs. Hunter." He grunted as he opened the door. James stepped aside and allowed the woman to enter. He pulled out a seat for her in front of her desk and gestured for her to sit down. He took a seat directly across from her. "I hope you have some good news for me."

"Depends on how you see good news." The woman's voice was stern. She handed him her paper. "This is the list of the lady's former employees and their salary requests to come work for you. You can see, some of them are quite high."

James looked over the list, reading the names and their requirements. "Alright." He mumbled. "And how do you feel about their quality of work?" He asked her.

She stared at him for a moment. "From the time I was there, they were all excellent employees." She stated.

James handed her back the paper. "You've had experience running a household. You write what you think is fair for each of them. Come back to me tomorrow and I'll draft something up. I'll have Eddie deliver the letters."

Mrs. Hunter continued to stare at him. "I am not your servant." She replied in a stern voice.

James took a deep breath, silently counting as he slowly let each breath go. "Yes, you have said that." He replied. "Would you please do me the favor of writing down what you feel fair wages for each one of those employees would be. Please."

"Alright." She said as she stood up with the paper in hand. "But you still owe me from my first favor."

"I told you to name what you wanted, and it will be yours. Have you decided what you want?"

"I will tell you in the morning."

Mrs. Hunter had one foot out the door when James said. "It's for her."

She turned to look at him. "I beg your pardon, my lord?"

"I could have cared less if this house fell apart around me. And Eddie is just fine on her own. I set up a small fortune for her should she choose to leave. As you can see, she enjoys tormenting me much more than money. But Christine, she deserves better than this." He gestured to the mess around him. "I am doing this for her." Mrs. Hunter nodded her head and left him alone.

Eddie waited by the door. "He let you in there?" She asked.

"We were having a meeting." Mrs. Hunter replied. "Were you eavesdropping? That's a nasty little habit." She chided.

"I wasn't, I was just, oh never mind. Why were you in a meeting with him?"

Mrs. Hunter walked towards the stairs with Eddie on her heels. She was not going to leave Mrs. Hunter alone. "If you must know, his lordship is looking for new staff. It seems that there is hardly any here." She huffed.

"Why would there be? No one likes him." Eddie followed Mrs. Hunter up the stairs.

Mrs. Hunter stopped in the upstairs hall. "Then why are you here?" Here glasses perched on the tip of her nose and she had one eyebrow raised as she waited for Eddie to answer. Eddie wiggled in her place. "I see, you want to be a mischievous thorn in the side."

"I am not mischievous." Eddie protested. "I don't have anything better to do."

"Well," Mrs. Hunter replied, "you should find something better to do." She turned on her heels and left Eddie standing in the hallway alone.

The next morning, Eddie threw open the door to James' office. James looked up from the papers he was signing. "How hard is it for you to stay out of my office."

"I want something to do." She demanded. "Something meaningful." Eddie placed her hands on her hips.

"Here." He said handing her the paperwork. "Deliver these." Eddie smiled and ran out of the room. Mrs. Hunter walked in and sat down in the chair. "Why do all the women in this house think they can walk into my office uninvited?"

"I've come to talk about the favors you owe me." She replied sitting up straight.

"I thought it was just one." He replied.

"Two favors. One for finding her ladyships servants and one for helping you decided a fair salary for them. That is two, Lord Prescott."

"I can count, madam." He sighed. "How much do you want?"

"I don't want a cent." She replied.

"Then what is it that you do want?"

"There is a hospital, and there are many people there that can pay for their own care. They are left to die. I want you to go there, find someone who needs help, and pay for their care." Mrs. Hunter said is her hands resting primly in her lap.

"That's all. Find one person and make sure they receive medical care?"

"Yes." She nodded her head.

"Even though there is a good chance that person would die regardless."

"Yes." She said again. "Right now."

"Fine." He grumbled as he stood up.

James left his office and put his coat before walking outside. He ordered his coach and traveled to the hospital Mrs. Hunter told him about. Inside, he inquired about a charity wing and was informed there was none.

"Where do you place patients that can't afford their care?" he asked.

"If they can walk out, they can leave." The doctor told him.

"And what if they can't?" James asked. The doctor showed James to a ward. The room was crammed with patients waiting for death. He looked around he was supposed to choose just one to save. James walked out of the room and left. He sent his driver home, and he walked the rest of the way, not paying attention to the pain in his leg. James wasn't sure when he arrived at his home and he didn't remember walking into his office. He sat at his desk staring blankly at the wall. Christine's sweet voice filtered in through his thoughts. He turned around when he realized his wife was trying to get his attention.

"How long will you sit there doing nothing?" She asked.

"That woman of yours......" He replied letting his voice trail off.

"Excuse me? You mean Mrs. Hunter." She said.

"Yes, her. How does she expect me to pick one person out of that group and try to save them?"

Christine stared at him for a moment, blinking. "I'm sorry, I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about."

James turned away from the window. "Mrs. Hunter asked me to go to the hospital and help one person. How am I supposed to pick just one to help? Do you know how many people are there sick and dying? And then I thought about all the people who can't get medical help at all. And what if I help someone and they weren't a good person? And what if I accidentally let a good person die? How am I supposed to figure this out, Christine?"

She smiled at him. "I think she might have been trying to teach you a lesson."

"What does she think she could possibly teach me?" James scowled.

Christine held out her hand. "Come with me, I have something to show you."

Reluctantly, James took his wife's hand. Christine led James upstairs to her room, now only containing a few dressers, a vanity, a wardrobe, and a desk she had brought from her home. She opened the bottom drawer and pulled out a battered hatbox.

"Where did you get that from?" James looked at her with shock, his wife was holding his darkest secrets in her hands. Reaching for the box, Christine pulled it away from him.

"Pearl gave this to me before she left. She asked me to help you organize it."

"Christine, I..." James stepped closer to retrieve his hatbox, she pulled it further away. "I didn't want anyone to see that. Please tell me you haven't opened it yet." His voice shaking.

"Opened it." She repeated as she put the box down on her desk, opening the lid. "I've organized and labeled your illegible scraps of paper into an orderly system." She pulled out the envelops she had inside and laid them neatly on the desk.

"You know what all this is?" He asked as beads of sweat began to form on his brow.

"Yes, these are the names of the people whose lives you've ruined." She looked up at her husband. His hands trembled and his pallor changed color to a sickly white. "For God sakes, James. I knew what kind of man you were before I said yes to you." She pointed to the first envelope. "These are the people that you feel you've repaid. These are the people that you have yet to repay." She pointed to the second envelope. "These are the people that you will never be able to repay." She said pointing to the third. "And these are the ones we don't know about." She pointed to the last.

"Who is 'we'?" he asked.

"Myself," Christine replied. James crossed his arms and nodded. "And Mrs. Hunter, of course."

"Naturally." He said. He heard the pause in her voice and watched her face, her mouth slightly open. "Who else knows about this, Christine?" His eyes narrowing.

"Just Matthew." She said waving her hands dismissively like he was supposed to know who she was referring to.

"Who is Matthew?" He growled.

"Fullcroft." She said offering a sweet smile. He waited patiently for her to respond, he jaw clenched tight. "He was Fredrick's lover."

"You shared my misery with your late husband's lover." He shouted.

"Matthew wouldn't tell a soul. He's kept secrets for years." James ignored her, storming out of the room using the connected doorway slamming it behind him. Christine opened the door, following him to their room.

"Leave me alone!" He bellowed.

"You can't scare me, James. You don't get to walk away from me like that."

He turned to face her. "You took my private business and shared it with strangers." He growled.

"I didn't share anything with strangers. I've known Mrs. Hunter since I was a child, and I have been friends with Mathew for many years."

"But I don't know them." He shouted.

Christine regarded him for a moment. "You are a spoiled and sullen child." She replied.

"Stop talking to Eddie about me." He said shaking his finger at her.

"You said the same thing to me the other day." Christine protested, still not backing down from him stepping closer to close the distance between them.

"I don't remember saying spoiled and sullen." He grumbled.

"You are." She said, her lips curling in a mischievous smile as she pushed her husband in the middle of the chest causing him to topple over onto their bed. Christine's smile widened as she climbed on top of her husband. She leaned closer to him, but the sound of their bedroom door slowly creaking open caused them both to turn their heads. Freddy stood in the doorway clutching his teddy bear. "Freddy, what are you doing?" She asked lightly.

"Miss White didn't come for me today. I was looking for her and I heard shouting." The little boy replied.

"I'll help you find her," Christine said climbing off her husband.

"Oh, I gave her a task this morning," James said. "I didn't realize you had Eddie doing something for you."

"My governess didn't come with us," Christine explained. "Eddie said she would help me until I found a suitable replacement."

"Ah," James replied. "That was part of her task this morning."

"Finding a governess?" She asked as she walked over to her son taking him by the hand.

"Staff in general. I've asked her to reach out to your former employees. I hope we can bring some of them back." He looked at his wife, she appeared grim with her mouth pulled in a tight line. "You already asked them to come with you." Christine nodded. "I can only imagine what some have said about coming here." He wrapped his arm around her as she walked with her son down the hall. "Well, what should we do to entertain young Freddy?" he asked looking down at the boy. "Young man, do you like racehorses?" The boy shook his head. "What about billiards?"

"No," Freddy replied offering a shy smile.

"Are you any good at gambling? I do know a few card games." James said.

"No." this time the boy giggled.

"Well, it appears I am all out of ideas to keep a young man such as yourself entertained," James replied. He winked at his wife. "Unless you like to play with marbles." He said.

Freddy smiled. "Yes."

"Alright. I think I know where my old marbles are." James led them to the library, still in need of a dusting. "Do you see that small cupboard in the corner?" He asked the boy pointing to a small cupboard door along the bottom of the wall. The boy nodded. "In there is a sack of marbles that I used to play with."

Freddy ran and opened the cupboard, quickly finding the bag of marbles. He peered inside and smiled as he pulled out a large and colorful cat's eye. "Will you play with me?" He asked James.

"I supposed it wouldn't be much fun to play by yourself," James replied. "And we don't want your mummy to ruin her pretty frock on the floor."

Freddy dumped the contents of the bag onto the floor. He flopped onto the floor to play his game. James slowly lowered himself onto the faded carpet. Glancing up at his wife, James saw Christine smile.

Hours had gone by; Eddie was heard singing in the hallway. "I'm back." Her voice echoed down the upstairs hall. "And I have good news for you." She called. "Where has everybody gone?"

"We're in the library, Eddie," James shouted causing Freddy to jump.

"You made me miss my shot" The little boy whined.

"Sorry about that, chap."

Eddie poked her head into the library. Christine sat in a corner doing her needlepoint. James stretched his body on the floor next to Freddy. The little boy had his knees tucked under him as he leaned over the marbles. "Well, don't the three of you look cozy." Eddie grinned.

James looked up at her. "You said you have good news."

"Always cross and impatient," Eddie replied. James let out an audible sigh while Christine stifled a giggle. "Master Fredrick's former governess shall be returning next week. It seems that her current situation is less than desirable."

"Good." James smiled.

"Of course, it's less than desirable. You've offered her double her former salary."

"How did you..." James started.

"I know everything," Christine replied, her husband stared at her, one eyebrow raised. "Did you honestly expect Mrs. Hunter to keep a secret from me?"

"Do you have any other news, Eddie?" James said. He looked away from Christine's smile and back at Eddie.

"Yes," Eddie Replied holding out the paperwork that James had given her earlier. She started to cross the room.

"Give it to her, not me." He said pointing to his wife. "They're her employees. Christine will oversee everything."

"Oh, erm, here," Eddie said handing the paperwork to Christine. Putting down her needlework, Christine accepted the papers from Eddie.

Christine scanned the paperwork and looked up at her husband. "You've hired back most of my staff at double their pay. Why would you do that?" She asked.

"For you." He replied. "And your son." Christine sighed loudly. "Christine, I have closed myself and my home many years ago. And I was fine to rot here alone, till you came. You don't deserve to live in this dilapidated home with no servants."

Christine regarded him for a moment taping her finger to her chin. "So, you would like me to handle the staff?"

"Yes."

"And I can make any changes to your home?"

"Anything my lady's heart desires."

"Good, I think I will have someone come in to add a few modern conveniences."

"But what about me?" Eddie protested. "You were willing to rot while I was here."

"Woman, I had a house ready for you," James grumbled.

"Robert told me to keep an eye on you," Eddie responded.

"I do not need anyone to keep an eye on me."

"Well, with the tea shop closed and Pearl gone, I'm lonely," Eddie replied twisting her fingers.

"Come along, Eddie," Christine said rising from her seat. She took Eddie by the elbow. "You can help me draw up plans to make changes to the townhome." Christine smiled leading Eddie out of the room.

"We should make changes to the country estate too." Eddie quipped.

James sat on the floor next to Freddy. "Those women are going to tear my homes apart." The little boy giggled, and they went back to their game.

*************************************************************************************

Months had gone by; James had settled into his new routine with Christine and her son. In the morning, Christine would talk to him about the construction she wanted to be done in the townhome and manor house. He agreed to her every whim. Her response was to kiss him and leave to take care of her work. As far as his agreement with Mrs. Hunter, James had decided to take care of all the lost souls that were sick and dying in the hospital. Christine had suggested encouraging their neighbors and friends to help as well. He left Christine in charge of everything. Her sweet demeanor meant very few people would say no to her. It had taken time, but fewer of the new servants ran from him. There was a certain ease in his soul that he was sure only Christine brought him. Christine stayed busy during the day with household duties and running the hospital charity care. James ran his brother's shipping business, balanced budgets, and made sure things ran smoothly. He spent a few hours every evening before supper to play games with Freddy. Christine would sit with them and do her needlepoint. The nights were when James had Christine to himself.

"James." She breathed quietly in their room. She had taken her hair down, he stood behind her unbuttoning her dress. He lifted her hair and kissed her neck. "You're not listening to me," She said.

"Of course, I'm not. I'm trying to get you undressed." He smiled. She gasped softly as his tongue traced her ear.

"Your sister is sending visitors." She said.

"Why should that bother me now? Look, my lovely. I have a fire started for you." He said.

"Because they will be staying with us." She replied. "And I can see the fire just fine from here."

"Who is she sending here?" James unbuttoned the last button on her dress, he pushed down the sleeves letting it fall.

"A young American girl named Anabel Potter and Mrs. Sara Clark."

"Do we know them?" He asked as he started untying the laces on her corset.

"I believe you might be acquainted with Mrs. Clark." She replied as her husband continued to eagerly undress her.

"I know no such woman." He said. "I want to

"Pearl mentioned that her last name was Spade."

"Finally." He said as he finished removing her undergarments.

Christine turned around. "Did you hear anything I've said?" She asked.

"Probably not," James replied as he picked her up carrying her to their bed. The couple laughed together as James covered her body in kisses.

He would forget he had this conversation with his wife for weeks until a timid American Girl arrives at his home one evening with Sally Spade, his brother's pickpocket.

"Please excuse the mess," Christine said leading her guests into her home. "I've hired a few men to help modernize the townhome."

"And next she will change my family's country estate." Grumbled a voice in the darkened hall. Lord Prescott stepped forward, leaning heavily on his cane. Annabel squeaked and grabbed Sally's hand. "Christine," the earl pointed at Sally and Annabel. "who are these two?" He stepped closer to the ladies.

"James, we spoke of this," Christine explained. "This is Miss Annabel Potter from America. And this is,"

"Sally Spade." His gruff tone caused Annabel to shake.

"No, this is Mrs. Sara Clark. They are cousins and they are from America." Christine corrected.

"Christine, I know who this is." James pointed at Sally. "She works for my brother and she is not from America. Nor does she have any family. She is a pitiful street urchin my brother and sister took in. Miss Spade, what dirty deed does my brother have you doing?" Sally unraveled herself from Annabel's embrace and calmly strode up to James Deacon, the Earl of Prescott. The man towered over her and grunted. "Well, Miss Spade? I'm waiting?" Annabel whimpered.

Sally kicked James' bad leg as hard as she could, causing the earl to howl in pain. Eddie laughed heartily as the earl jumped up and down on his good leg. "It's none of your damn business why I'm here," Sally shouted.

"It's my house and I have a say as to who stays under my roof." He shouted back.

Sally stormed off and headed for the darkened stairway. "I'm exhausted, I'm freezing, and I'm seasick. Someone please show me to my damn room. And why are there no lights in this home." Sally screamed as she stomped up the steps.

"I'll be right up, dear," Eddie replied laughing. "I love Sally, you never know what that girl is going to do." Eddie followed Sally up the steps.

"Annabel, get up here," Sally shouted.

Annabel looked to Lady Prescott who was suppressing a smile. She then looked at the growling earl. "Sorry, sir." Annabel offered weakly. "When Sally's in a temper like this, it's best to do what she asks." Annabel ran to the stairs. "Coming, Sally." She shouted back.

James limped to the sitting room with the help of his wife. "Who invited that vile little girl here?" He shouted.

"James, we spoke of this earlier." Christine giggled.

"Stop laughing at me." He shouted. "When did we speak of such things?"

"Two weeks ago." She giggled.

"I do not recall any mention of this siege on my home." He grumbled.

"This is my home as well."

"What were we doing when we had this so-called conversation?"

Christine laughed louder. "I believe you were undressing me."

"Well, of course, I didn't hear you." Christine helped him to the setae.

Sitting next to him, Christine gently lifted his leg onto her lap. "It is not my fault you didn't hear me." She smiled as she gently massaged his bad leg. "Your sister did mention that you knew Mrs. Clark, but she didn't go into great detail about how you might have known her."

"Her name is Sally Spade. She was Robert's little pet." He grumbled. "He rescued the tiny street urchin and put her to work for him."

"You mean she was a...." Christine trailed off.

"No, well possibly. One can never tell with Miss Spade what she is. She ran all sorts of errands for him, did anything he asked. He even sent her here after my accident with Margarete. She didn't leave me alone until I was well enough to throw her out myself. The ingenious little witch always found her way back into my home."

"I'm surprised you didn't marry her." Christine chuckled.

"She was stealing from me." He groaned. "Besides, the last thing I wanted here was one of my brother's spies."

"That little thing, a spy?"

"Christine, she can become anything she wants, blend in anywhere. I've seen her dressed as a little girl to gain access to someone's house. She's a sly thing, and you've invited her to stay."

"She is not here to spy. She is Miss Potter's traveling companion."

"And who the devil is Miss Potter? That wide-eyed little brat?"

"James, Miss Potter is a wealthy American heiress looking for a titled husband. Many girls are coming here to do it. Sally, Mrs. Clark, is posing as her cousin so Miss Potter can travel."

"See, they have you lying now."

"Sally married a wealthy man. He passed away and left her his entire fortune. She is posing as Miss Potter's cousin, Eddie will be their chaperone and I will introduce her into society."

"This idea is pure idiocy," James grumbled.

"I never said it wasn't. I'm repeating what your sister wrote to me." Christine smiled sweetly as James frowned. "I need to go check on Freddy." Christine gently rose from the setae. "Don't pout down here too long." She leaned over and kissed the tip of his nose.

Later that evening, James came to bed. His wife was sitting at her vanity in her room brushing her hair. She had the adjoining door open. James leaned on the door frame watching her. Her reflection in the mirror watched him.

"I was right." He said as he walked over to her. He took the brush from her hand and laid it down on the vanity. He kissed her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze.

"About what?" She asked turning to look at him. He tugged her hand and she rose from her seat.

"Miss Spade..."

"Mrs. Clark." She smiled.

"Don't correct me, I know who she is. Miss Spade does have another agenda, from my brother." He pulled Christine into his embrace.

"And what is the secret agenda your brother has." She smiled.

"It's about his new wife, your cousin." He said smoothing her hair with his hands. She waited patiently for him to explain. "She is also being blackmailed. Probably by the same person who tried to blackmail you." The color drained from his wife's face. "This isn't your fault." He said softly.

"I should have paid..." She said.

"No, usually this type of person will blackmail multiple people. It's a coincidence that your cousin is also being blackmailed."

She turned to look at him, he squeezed her shoulder. "Really?" She asked.

"Yes." He said. "Possibly. Maybe."

"That doesn't sound reassuring." She frowned.

"Don't worry, my lovely. You have nothing to fear from that nasty little blackmailer." James said kissing his wife.

"If you're sure." Christine sighed. James held his wife a little tighter.

Christine's new responsibilities kept her occupied most afternoons and a few evenings. She escorted Anabel and Sally to various tea parties and dinner parties to introduce them to her society friends. She didn't mind going along with the young ladies at first. Visiting the other socialites allowed Christine a chance to talk about her charity work. The teas and private concerts gave her ideas on how to begin fundraising for their project. And while Anabel was eager to visit the fine ladies of London, Sally appeared uncomfortable. The petite woman constantly fidgeted in her seat. When she was asked questions about her background, Sally was evasive and often grew irritated. Sally did her best to give short answers while Anabel chattered on. Most of Christine's friends were amused by the pair, but she was sure the only reason why she was invited places was people were curios about Christine's new husband. One afternoon, the trio of ladies walked home from a luncheon. Anabel and Sally walked arm and arm as they quietly argued with each other.

"Lady Denton." Someone hissed. Christine turned her head to see a young woman with dark hair standing in an alley. She signaled for Christine to come closer. Christine recognized the young woman; she had delivered the first blackmail letter to Christine.

"You two go on, I'll catch up with you." She said, but neither Anabel nor Sally seemed to hear as they both continued walking. As Christine approached her the woman smiled. A grimy little man with dark stringy hair and rotten teeth stood next to the young woman. He remained silent.

"I'm sorry, it's Lady Prescott now. Isn't it? I heard about your recent nuptials."

"What is it that you want? You can tell whoever sent you that I won't pay you a damn thing."

"Yes," The girl smiled. "Your husband said something similar. Another rushed wedding, my lady. People must wonder about you."

"I don't give a damn about what others think of me or my family," Christine said through clenched teeth.

"That is clear to see by your choice in husbands." Her grin grew wider. "What will you do when that new husband of yours grow tired of you and casts you and your son out?"

"How dare you."

"You know what he's done. You must know what he's capable of. The lives he's ruined. When he's done with you, who will protect you then?"

"You are a filthy little worm. And so is the person you're working for." Christine said.

"You know I'm right." She smiled. "It's only a matter of time."

"Bugger off," Christine said as she stormed away. She was so angry she didn't even see the person in front of her. After colliding with the man, Christine looked up to see her cousin. She quickly smiled and greeted him. Although she smiled politely, Christine could not get the woman's words out of her mind. "It's only a matter of time."

*************************************************************************************

The new arrivals to his home aggravated James more than he cared to admit. From Sally stealing his cigars, Annabel's incessant talking, and none of the women stayed out of his office, James didn't have a moment of silence to himself. He was almost glad that Christine was having his country home renovated as well. He would finally have space of his own. Although, the one person he wouldn't mind invading his space was Christine. He looked forward to every moment with her. As the weeks progressed, James noticed a change in Christine. At first, her appetite decreased. Later she was complaining of headaches and soon she had mood swings. When James questioned her, Christine complained of being tired. He usually kissed her on the forehead and let her rest.

Late one evening, James sat in his office reviewing the notes Christine left for him on their staff and her charity work with the hospital. Annabel opened the door and waltzed in, she sat on his desk, crossing her ankles and swung her legs.

"What is the matter with Christine?" She asked. James inwardly groaned at her use of Christine's first name and not her title. The young Miss Potter had become too familiar with them in his opinion.

"Miss Potter, one does not sit on someone's desk and swing their legs." He said. "It's not ladylike."

"I know." She giggled. "Georgie says the same thing."

"Georgie?" He asked. "You mean Lord Southerton."

"Yes." She smiled wider. The young woman was no longer afraid of him. "The two of you are a lot alike. Did you know that?"

"I did not, and we are not." He yelled, putting Anabel into another fit of hysterics. This wasn't the first time someone compared him to the Southerton twit.

"You didn't answer my question about Christine." She smiled.

"I do not know what's wrong with my wife." He frowned crossing his arms across his chest. "Why, do you know?"

"No." She hopped off his desk. Anabel turned around to face him, crossing one arm across her chest and taping one finger to her chin while she thought. "You don't think she's received another letter from the blackmailer?"

"I stopped the last one from going to her. And I sent a very threatening reply. No one would dare...."

"That's the problem with all you nobles." She replied placing her hands on her hips. "I tell Georgie this all the time. You all assume everyone is afraid of you and your title, but in reality, no one is."

"And you take far too many liberties that you have no business taking." He shouted.

"I don't scare so easily, Lord Prescott," Anabel replied as her eyes narrowed.

James fumed at the girl's insolent tone. He could see that shouting at her did nothing. He stepped a little closer. "You are in my home, young lady. You will be respectful."

Anabel stared at him, her nostrils flared. She stormed out of the room, stomping her feet as she left. He smiled before sitting back down, if he had known it would be that easy to shut her up he would have done it months ago. James sat back down at his desk to finish up his work. He wasn't left alone for much longer. Sally threw his office door open, George Southerton was trailing behind her, the couple holding hands. He eyed them in their strange clothing, both of them dressed like street toughs.

"She's paid him." Sally spat the words from her mouth. James opened his mouth. "Your wife has been paying the blackmailer."

James pushed himself out of his seat. "Christine!" He bellowed. His wife stepped calmly into his study.

"There's no need to shout, James. I was right across the hall." Christine glanced at her cousin, husband, and Sally. The smile faded from her lips.

"I told you I would protect you and Freddy," James yelled pounding the desktop with his fist. "Why, why would continue to pay the man who was blackmailing you?"

Christine trembled with fear. "The letters kept coming." She cried, tears rolling down her chin. "He promised that the letters would stop."

"No, they wouldn't," James replied. "People who do that don't stop once you pay them."

"But,"

"It's your father, Christine. The man you delivered the money to, wasn't the person blackmailing you." George hissed. "Your father owes that man a great deal of money. And you were the only one paying that scoundrel's debt."

Christine looked from face to face. "I don't understand. How is this, my father?" She questioned.

"Lord Winthrope owes Jack money, it's probably a gambling debt," Sally replied.

"Probably?" George snorted. "Defiantly." Sally elbowed him in the ribs. George jumped and rubbed his side.

"Jack said your father is running out of time to pay back his debt." Sally continued.

"What happens if my father doesn't pay him back in time?"

"I didn't ask," Sally said.

"Do you really care?" George asked. Christine gasped.

"For once I agree with your idiot cousin." James barked. Christine frowned at him. "After everything you told me about your parents, after all he's done now. Do you really care what happens to him? You ran from their home for a reason, Christine."

"I was tired of being protected," Christine replied. "I thought I could take care of this on my own." She sniffed.

"You saw what they did to me when I tried to take care of this on my own," George said.

"I need to have a word in private with my wife. Please excuse us." James growled. Sally and George left quickly.

"Why, Christine?" James asked staring down his wife. Her hands began to tremble, and eyes filled with tears. "Have I not been kind to you and Freddy? We have come so far together. Why would you go behind my back and pay the blackmailer?"

"You are going to send me away." She said through clenched teeth.

"What in God's name are you talking about? Why would you think something like that?"

"Because you said you would send me away. Once I gave you a child, you would send me away. And I was afraid that someone would find me, and it would start again."

James stared at his wife, mouth open eyes wide. "You're making me..." He stepped closer to her. She stayed still, her back like a stiff rail. James slowly walked to her, his hands clasped her shoulders tight. "You're pregnant, with my child, and you went to that awful man." He watched her tremble in front of him. The thought of losing her made him ache.

"You said you would send me away." She repeated herself.

"Damnit, woman. I said you could go if you wished to leave and no one would think any less of you for it."

"But you said..."

"I know what I said." James took a deep breath. He wiped his eyes and felt damp tears on the palm of his hand. He would look like a blubbering fool begging her to stay. Opening his mouth, he tried to speak, his words would not obey. Closing his mouth quickly, he clenched his jaw tight.

"Are you," Christine paused staring at him. "crying?" Her hand caressed his cheek, her thumb wiping a falling tear.

James pulled her into a tight embrace. "Don't leave, please." He begged. "I need you by my side. I gave you that choice to leave, but I hoped you wouldn't." He felt her wiggle in his arms. "I love you, Christine."

"You're squeezing me too tight." She gasped. James relaxed his hold on her, she kissed him softly. "You love me?" She asked. James nodded.

"I don't want you to leave." He took her hand and led her to an old brown leather sofa. He sat down and positioned Christine on his lap. She opened her mouth to speak, but James placed a finger to her lips. "I don't expect you to love me in return...."

Christine pushed away his hand and kissed him. His fingers pulling at her hairpins. With her hands on his shoulders she pushed herself away. "I thought you wanted your home back." She said as she rested her head on his shoulder.

"I want our houseguests gone." He replied stroking her hair. "But you and Freddy and Mrs. Hunter are welcome to stay as long as you like." He kissed the top of her forehead. "I thought you understood, after everything we've been thought, I want you to stay. I've always wanted you to stay." His hand immediately going to her belly. "When will you deliver?" he asked rubbing her stomach.

"I'm not that far a long, a month or two at the most. We have a long way to go." She smiled placing her hand on top of his.

He held Christine for what felt like hours, he could have held her forever. "I suppose you're tired." He whispered to her, she nodded her head. "Then let's go to bed." He said as he let her go, allowing her to get up from his lap. Christine held his hand leading him from his office, he knew he would follow her where ever she took him.

After spending a quiet night with his wife discussing a few of the changes that they would be experiencing, James left his lovely bride sleeping peacefully. He had met Mrs. Hunter in the dining room at breakfast and he explained the situation to her.

"Naturally, I would ask Eddie for help, but she has been occupying herself with the Southerton boy. There are still some staff members that prefer to deal only with Christine. And I can't say that I blame them. She's been stressed, and I would like her to rest as much as possible." He said.

"Lady Prescot can handle things well on her own. This isn't her first time expecting."

"I understand, but I..." Suddenly James felt his throat dry and close. Even after their talk last night, James could only think of all the horrible things that could go wrong.

"You're worried." Mrs. Hunter finished for him.

"I don't deserve her." He choked on his words. "Or any children she might give me. I don't deserve to be happy."

"If you keep thinking like that, misfortune will follow you." She replied. "But I will do what I can to make sure the lady has her rest." She walked out, but before leaving she stopped next to him, placing her hand on his shoulder. "You've done right by Christine and Freddy."

James attempted to smile at the woman as she left. Just as James gathering his composure, Anabel waltzed in. The younger woman brushed her skirt with the palm of her hands. Crossing his arms over his chest, James waited for some insulting jib to slip from her mouth. Instead, Anabel clasped her hands together and cleared her throat.

"Lord Prescott." She began as if she was reciting a practiced speech. "I realize that I often speak out of turn...."

"Miss Potter, if you intend on insulting me any further..."

"Lord Prescott, please let me finish. Apologies are hard for me, and Sally informed me that if I do not apologize properly she would break my nose, and I believe she meant it since she was very angry last night after her argument with George, Lord Southerton, see I'm socially inept."

"Do you plan on stopping for a breath?"

"Please, Lord Prescott, I am not good at apologizing. I find it difficult to admit my bad behavior and make amends...."

"Miss Potter, I have found that the best way to seek forgiveness is to not make an ass of myself in the first place." James replied as his ears began to ring form her constant chatter. "You see, I also don't make the best apologies. Most people, like Eddie, refuse them from me and enjoy making my life miserable."

"Does that mean you except my apology?" She asked as she played with her thumb.

"I would be a hypocrite if I didn't." He replied placing his arm around Anabel. He led her to his office. "How do you like London society?" He questioned her.

"It's fine. I enjoy the outings. I've met some interesting people. Lord Southerton I knew from Philadelphia. And Lord Fullcroft is wonderfully amusing. And I'm not sure what to say about the Canterburys. And Lady Prescott, she is simply amazing."

"That's not what I meant, Miss Potter. I don't see you running off to teas and fetes. I know you've been invited to several social gatherings and unless Sally or my wife accompany you, you refuse to go."

"I hate it." Anabel replied. "I hate all the rules I have to remember and the social graces I must follow. I can't keep track of everything and I feel like everyone is laughing at me. I'd go home, but I didn't want to admit that I couldn't find a wealthy husband without my family's help."

"Ah, so you hide in here and let boredom set in, until you decide to pester me." He smiled at her.

"I don't mean to be a bother." She replied looking at the floor. James sat at his desk.

"Good." He said, gesturing for Anabel to take a seat across from him. "I might have a task or two to keep you busy." He smiled at her for the first time since her arrival. "I've started a charity and my wife has taken over the duties. I would like her to spend more time resting."

"Is she sick?"

"No."

"Is she hurt?" Anabel gasped.

"No, Miss Potter. Christine is neither sick nor hurt." He replied.

"I don't understand. If she's not sick or hurt, why does she need to rest?"

"Because she's pregnant." James shouted. Anabel's face turned red but quickly faded as the broke out into hysterical fits of laughter. "What do you find so amusing, Miss Potter."

"My mother ran our father's business while she was pregnant with the three of us." James groaned as Anabel composed herself. Folding her hands neatly in her lap Anabel said, "Just so I understand you correctly. You started a charity that your wife is running. And now you would like me to take over for your wife."

"That was the general idea." James grumbled.

"Alright, I'll do it." She folded her arms across her chest.

"Good." He replied.

"If you give me a good reason why." She smiled.

"I don't have to justify any decision I make to you."

"And I don't have to help." She said.

"I'm busy." James moaned.

"Doing what? You hide in here every day, sending other to do things you should be taking care of. You don't leave unless its to spend time with your wife or Freddy. What are you doing that is so important?"

"People don't like me."

"I don't understand how that is a problem. You say that you have a title that demands respect. So why don't you demand it?"

James sat there for a moment contemplating her words. Demand respect, he had done it for years; never truly earning someone's respect. "What do you suggest I do, Miss Potter? Storm into people's homes and demand they give money to my cause?"

"I was thinking more of inviting people into your home. Then convincing them to donate to your cause."

"Do you think its really that easy?" He shouted. "No one will come here. No one speaks to me."

"Because you hide in your home like a hermit." She sighed. "You wealthy are all alike. You enjoy scandal and gossip."

"What is your point, Miss Potter?"

"Throw a soiree, people will come if only to satisfy their own curiosity about you."

"And then what? Demand they give me money."

"Obviously, you can't be that crass. It will take time, throw these galas yearly. Give people a reason to want to come." She replied.

James stared at her frowning, obviously disliking her suggestion. "I wanted this done, taken care of." He replied.

"Well you didn't gain the reputation of being a heartless bastard overnight. Building your charity will take time as well."

"Do you have anything more to offer than a few cutting remarks about my personality?" He grumbled.

"I'll think of something." The young woman smiled.

"Good, go think of something. And let me know when you have something in mind." He waved her off.

Pouring through ledgers, he didn't hear the door to his office open. Christine stood in front of him tapping her finger on the desktop to get his attention. "Did you really put Mrs. Hunter in charge of my staff?" She asked.

"I thought it best." He replied without looking up from his ledgers.

"James I am perfectly capable of running the household." She sighed. "And then I find Anabel making plans to hold a gala for our charity. I have been doing that. I wanted to do that before Christmas."

James looked up at his wife. Even when she was angry, she was beautiful. "You are perfect and more than capable of doing anything you put your mind to." He said offering him a smile.

"You cannot flatter me when I'm cross." She folded her arms across her chest and frowned at him.

He got up from his desk and took Christine in his arms. "It is not simple flattery, my love. You are a capable and bright woman." He kissed her cheek. "And beautiful."

"James," She pushed his shoulders away; he tightened his embrace. "I am still cross with you." A small smile creased her lips.

"Alright, my love." He replied. "Go and be cross with me. I only wanted to be helpful." He gave her another kiss as he let her go. "And don't think I didn't see you smile."

"I will go. I am going to run our household." She said on her way out. "And I am still cross." She shouted.

James laughed to himself, determined to find more ways to treat Christine the way she deserved. He stepped out into the hall, watching her leave.

"Aren't you funny when you're lovestruck." He heard Eddie behind him. He turned around quickly causing the woman to jump. He knew she wasn't expecting him to respond to her jib. Picking up his former governess, he spun the woman around while she squealed for help. "Help! He's going to kill me." James gave her a squeeze. "Put me down before you hurt me." She shouted. James placed her back on the ground and gave Eddie a kiss on the cheek. "Are you drunk?" She asked.

"No." He replied. "I'm going to be a father and it's all because of you." He kissed her again.

"I had nothing to do with that." Eddie shrieked, taking a step backwards stumbling a bit.

"Eddie, you pestered me to do something to help. And if I ignored you..."

"I would have been more persistent." She replied.

"I know, but if I hadn't listed to you. I wouldn't have Christine, and Freddy, and our child." He smiled. "Thank you." He replied sheepishly to the woman he callously thrown out over a decade ago. "I should have done better by you and my sister."

Eddie eyed him wearily and stepped away. She paused and stared at him for a moment. "James." She said softly. "Your father," Eddie's voice started to shake. She took a deep breath and steadied herself. "I think your father would have been proud at what you are doing. He would be happy that you are finally owning up to your mistakes and taking responsibility for yourself."

"Does this mean you will finally forgive me?" He asked, his voice just about a whisper.

"When my Pearl forgives you, then so will I." She said as she walked away from him, leaving him with the reminder that he still had a long way to go.

Anabel traipsed lightly down the steps passing a silent Eddie along the way. "What's gotten into everyone today?" She asked. "Eddie is quiet, Mrs. Hunter is bossing everyone around and Lady Prescott snapped at me. And you, well you're still the same miserable self."

James headed back to his office. He could hear Anabel's footsteps behind him. "I've hurt a great many people, Miss Potter." He said as he stood at his window.

"I know." She replied.

"I destroyed lives, not just hard-working people, but those of my own family."

"Yes, I heard the stories."

"I was asked to help Christine, and I strong armed her into marriage with me."

"Yes, I understand. But honestly, what more could you have done for her?"

"I could have searched out the bastard blackmailing her instead. Then Christine and Freddy would be happy and free of me." He said.

"Free of you? Is that what you think they want?"

"Well, I...."

"She loves you, even if you are a grumpy old bear." She sniggered while he frowned at her. "And Freddy enjoys his time with you."

"How do you know?"

"Freddy told me."

"He talked to you? Christine said he's painfully shy."

"He is, but I talked and talked and finally he talked back."

"What did my stepson tell you." James froze, Anabel smiled. It was the first time he thought of himself as a father even though Christine and Freddy had been living under his roof for some time.

"He said that you spend every evening playing games with him. And you talk to him like he's an adult. He said it makes him feel important. I'm sure he enjoys the attention. Children can often be overlooked." She said. "I may talk a lot, Lord Prescott. But I do listen, and I pay attention." She sighed. "You look like you could use a drink." She walked over to the bookshelf. She poured two glasses of sherry and placed them on his desk.

"I have a lot on my mind, Miss Potter..."

"I can see that." She replied. "Sit down, have a drink and tell me what's on your mind."

Following her direction, James sat down and took a sip of his drink. "How much has my sister and Eddie told you?"

"Eddie hasn't said a word, but Pearl said...."

"Elizabeth. Her name is Elizabeth. She stopped going by her given name when I threw them out." Anabel mouthed a silent 'oh'. She folded her hands in her lap and waited for him to continue. "That woman..." James pointed to the hall.

"Eddie," Anabel replied.

"Yes, Eddie. She and my father had an affair for years. She was Robert and my governess. Although I was sent to boarding school shortly after she was employed here. I was home for Christmas and I caught the two of them in here. I was disgusted." He said.

"I understand, but that type of thing is common, is it not?"

"My mother was on her deathbed. She had always been sickly, but she was dying and how did my father treat her? He was carrying on an affair with a woman half his age. He told me as soon as my mother passes, he was going to marry Eddie. I told him what a fool he was. What would people think about him, he would ruin his life over a governess. Our lives would be ruined because of his mistake. He didn't bring it up again, but when our mother finally passed, my father again said he would marry Eddie. I threw a fit like a petulant child. Mother wasn't even cold in her grave. He let the matter drop.

"Before long, Eddie was expecting Elizabeth. I supposed it was my jealousy that caused my hatred of my younger sister. Our father was harsh with Robert and me, but with Elizabeth, I believed he loved her more than us. He doted upon her, spoiled her. She was our father's precious little pearl. I was outraged that he sent his little bastard to a fancy boarding school. The day my father passed, I contacted the school personally to make sure that Elizabeth was withdrawn. Once Robert returned to his school, I threw both Eddie and my sister out with only the clothing on their backs. No one stopped me, no one contradicted me. I had absolute control. It wasn't long before I began using my rank and privilege to get what I wanted. The few that did stand in my way or speak their minds, I made sure I ruined their lives as well."

"But you can't continue to blame yourself."

"I can."

"But..."

"Do you want me to continue or not?" He asked. Anabel nodded. "My brother found out what I did. He was furious with me. I told him that I didn't have a problem cutting him off as well. Before I could follow through with my threat, my brother withdrew as much of his fortune that he could, and he disappeared. I didn't hear anything from him until he found Eddie and our sister. He sent me a letter stating he would spend the rest of his life embarrassing me and our family name. The two of them opened that whore house and he made sure everyone knew who he was." James stopped speaking. He picked up his glass, finishing his drink.

"And what about your wife? The first one." Anabel asked as she poured him another glass.

"Margarete." He said. "She was a French beauty. I left England to hide from my brother's scandal. Margarete barely spoke a word of English when we met. Her family didn't have much money. I thought that would make her easier to control. Foolish thinking on my part. I married her and brought her back home. It didn't take her long to discover what I had done. I caught her frantically packing her things one night. I shouted at her. I told her I bought them, it all belonged to me. If she wanted to leave, she left naked. She screamed at me, picking up a fire poker and started hitting me with it. I never struck her back." He shook his head. "She continued to hit me, and I stumbled out of the room away from her. Once I was close to the stairs, she gave me a big push. I broke my leg in the fall."

He sat there for a moment. Anabel perched on the edge of her seat waiting for him to speak again. "I deserved it. I let her run off with whatever she wanted, but I just lay there. I think she thought I was dead."

"Then what?" Anabel asked leaning forward with anticipation.

"He cried like a ninny." Sally laughed from the doorway.

"Eavesdropping, Sally?" James asked.

"No." She replied. I came down to discuss business with you, but I heard your tale of woe." She snorted. "Go on, James. Tell Anabel what happened next."

"My brother sent her here." He said pointing at the petite woman."

"No, he didn't," Sally replied.

"Then how did you find your way to my doorstep, Mrs. Clark." His voice dripping with sarcasm.

"Miss Pearl sent me." She smiled. "Just to see what had happened to you. But Robert found out what she did. He was furious at her for it. Once I told him how bad you were, he sent me back."

"They sent you to take care of him?" Anabel asked.

"Of course. Someone had to care for him. He fired most of his staff. He couldn't do a damn thing. He didn't know how to cook or anything. I had to show him how to work the stove." She smiled. "Couldn't have both of us starving."

"Nancy mentioned that she never saw any kitchen staff, but there was always food ready. Why did you let your staff go?" Anabel asked.

"I wanted to die." He grumbled.

"Aren't you glad I came along to save you?" Sally chuckled. "You wouldn't have that sweet wife."

"Oh, he thinks he forced Christine to marry him," Anabel replied. Both women laughed.

"What do you both find so amusing?" He said.

"Miss Pearl told me about your first meeting. Neither one of you could keep your eyes off each other. She said she's never felt more uncomfortable than when the two of you stared at each other."

"What are you suggesting?" He asked.

"Christine had options," Anabel replied. "Lord Fullcroft proposed before you did."

"I thought I proposed first." He said.

` "No. He proposed a few days before. Amelia and your brother would have taken her and Freddy in. George would have done the same. Christine had options. She chose to marry you." Anabel smiled with smug satisfaction as she stood up. "I think I'll leave you with some new thoughts." She beamed. "Oh, Sally." She said before leaving. "There is a dinner party I would like to attend." Sally groaned loudly. "It's in a few weeks, Sally. Please?"

"I'll think about it," Sally mumbled. Anabel smiled and skipped out of the room.

James looked at Sally. "I see you don't care for London society either."

"No," Sally replied coolly. She folded her arms across her chest.

"Well, what did you wish to speak to me about?"

"Now that we know who's been sending the blackmail letters, what do we do about it?"

"Nothing."

"What? Why not?"

"Sally," James clicked his tongue. "Lady Prescott won't pay her father's gambling debt."

"And what if he spreads those nasty little stories?" She asked.

"Firstly, anyone who can't see that Freddy is indeed Lord Denton's son is a fool. Secondly, the man is a known philanderer with a gambling problem. Lastly, from what I have been told by Christine and Robert, the man tried to rape his own niece." He said sternly. Sally nodded her head. "So, he can tell all the little storied he'd like, but once everyone knows who is spreading the gossip, I'm sure no one will pay any attention to it. Besides, what do you think your friend Jack will do to that spineless Winthrope bastard when he can't pay any more of his debt?"

"Kill him." She said.

"The problem solves itself."

"But Christine did pay some of her father's debt. What if Jack decides to cut out the middle man and continue with the blackmail?" She asked.

"Sounds like it might be too much work for Jack." He said. "No, Sally. I plan on doing nothing and I suggest you tell the Southerton twit to do the same."

"We aren't speaking." She folded her arms across her chest as she turned her face away.

James wanted to reprimand her for her involvement with George Southerton but thought best to stay silent on the matter. "You have contacted my brother?" He asked.

Sally nodded her head. "You're going to be an uncle soon." She replied. "Robert is very excited."

"And what of my sister? It seems she has quit responding to any of my letters now that Robert is happily married."

"Why, what do you want from Pearl?"

'Forgiveness', he thought to himself. "Nothing." He said. "I wanted to see how she was. My solicitor has reached out to her as well. I've sent her the inheritance she was due. No one seems to hear back from her."

"I wouldn't worry about Miss Pearl," Sally said. "She and Robert have made a nice little fortune for themselves. She'll be just fine."

"I'm not worried about her. She doesn't answer me, and it is infuriating."

Sally smiled at him with her eyes full of mischief, as if she knew the real reason he was trying so hard to get in touch with his sister. "I'm sure she has plenty of things to keep her busy."

James grunted. "Should you speak to her again, tell her I said to come home. She has a house in the country waiting for her."

"Tell her yourself," Sally said getting up.

James huffed when she left. He pulled out a piece of stationary, scribbling a quick _Come Home_ to his sister. He folded it neatly and left it on his desk for the morning. He thought about riding over to Southerton's home. He had already made it clear to George that he didn't approve of his involvement with Sally. Unfortunately, they were both adults and there wasn't much he could do about it. He decided to take his own advice and do nothing. Problems like these seemed to solve themselves.

*************************************************************************************

Two weeks later, Christine sat at her vanity getting ready for the dinner party she promised to take Anabel to. Sally had reluctantly agreed to go with them. Christine was pleased, her cousin was attending as well. George loved Sally, and she wanted them both happy. If she could only get her husband to hurry up and dress.

"James," Christine called from her sitting room. He walked in, still not dressed for dinner. She frowned. "Why haven't you dressed yet?" She asked him.

"Is that thing tonight?" He asked.

"Don't play daft with me. You know it is tonight. And it is not a thing, it's a dinner party."

"And I hate those things." He replied. "Why do you want to go? You haven't been feeling well. We should just stay at home."

"I promised to go." She said.

James huffed. "I don't see why I have to attend these functions."

"You want our peers involved in our charity, we both need to attend these functions. And I enjoy the company of my husband." She smiled at him.

"Is that all you wanted from me? To make sure I was getting dressed?"

"Yes." She stood up from her vanity. "And no." Wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him. He embraced her tightly.

"Do we have to go?" He asked.

"I'll make it worth your while." She smiled

"Right now?"

"No, tonight. When we get home."

"Fine." He groaned. "I will get dressed. I don't want to, but just for you I will."

She smiled watching her husband reluctantly go. He was much softer than his outward appearance showed, and she learned exactly how to bend him to her will. Christine understood why James didn't like to venture out into public. Many times, while she had been introducing Anabel to her society friends, Christine would overhear other ladies discussing her situation. Some felt sorry for her, others had mocked her choice in a husband. It didn't bother her, James loved her and cared for Freddy like his own son. He would do anything she asked of him, there was no scheming, begging, or pleading to get what she wanted from her husband. Not like other wives. No, Christine was fortunate. James treated her like an equal, valuing her opinion, respecting her decisions, and he was more passionate with her. He made her feel safe and loved.

Inside their coach, Christine prepared for a bumpy ride. Anabel, constantly excited, could barely sit still. Sally, seeming more sullen this evening, stared out the window. Finally, James slid in next to her.

"Don't think I don't know what you are doing." He whispered low in her ear, sending chills down her spine.

"I don't understand your meaning." She replied. Christine didn't meet his gaze, hiding a smile from him.

"Don't play coy with me, my love." He leaned closer. "I know you bribed me to come along tonight."

"I think you are giving me too much credit."

"I might just pull you into a darkened alcove and have my way with you." He kissed her neck.

"Husband, behave yourself." She chided.

"I will do what I please, wife." He replied reaching his arms around her.

"You have guests," Sally stated. Her tone was flat as she crossed her arms over her chest.

"Guests I did not invite." James teased. Anabel giggled, Sally went back to staring out her window.

"You're being rude." Christine admonished. "Sally, he didn't mean it."

"Yes, I...ofh." He groaned as Christine elbowed him in the ribs.

The rest of the ride, James snuck kisses, Anabel giggled, and Sally ignored all three. When they arrived, James stuck to his wife's side.

"You should mingle with other guests, dear."

"I don't want to." He said as they walked around. "Where did our grumpy little pickpocket go off too?" He asked.

"I'm sure George has found her by now."

"Christine, what are you doing?" She shrugged her shoulders. "You haven't come up with some hair-brained scheme, have you? She doesn't wish to see him again."

"You don't know that." She said.

"I do know that. She told me herself." He replied.

"James, you don't always know what's best. And our scheme is not hairbrained."

"So, you admit that there is a scheme. You admit that this is a scheme. You and Miss Potter coming up with schemes together."

"And George." She smiled. Her husband groaned. "It looks like it's time to eat." She said.

"Good, I'm starving." They sat together, Christine looked around for Sally. Catching George's eye, he motions for her to follow him.

"Where are you off to? James asked.

"I think something's wrong. Sally never came back."

"Back from where." He got up following his wife. Anabel was quick on their heels.

"I can't explain now," Christine replied. They met George in the hall. He handed her a note. Christine read through it quickly.

"She's been kidnapped." George's hands were shaking. "I need help." He said as he walked outside. Christine and her entourage following him outside.

"Sally can handle herself," James grumbled.

Christine shook her head. "Sally is carrying George's child." She whispered in his ear. James clenched his jaw tight.

"I need help," George said. "Please, I need your help." James nodded his head. "We'll take my carriage."

"I'm coming," Christine said.

"No," James said. Before she could protest, James said. "I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you. Please, go home where it is safe. Miss Potter, I trust you to get my wife home safe."

"Yes, sir." The young woman replied.

"This way," George said.

James followed him. "I don't like what you've done. And I don't particularly care for you." James said. "I am doing this for Sally only."

"I was trying to propose to her tonight. She wasn't listening. She thinks Anabel and I are planning to wed. It's ridiculous. I've known Anabel since she was a girl."

"If you hurt Sally anymore...."

"I love her. And I don't care who knows it. And I don't care if people find out who she really is."

"I will hold you to your word," James said.

They arrived at the dilapidated Winthrop townhome. George started banging on the front door, but it easily pushed open.

"I think we've been expected," James said. George rushed in, running up the front steps. "Do you even know where you are going, Southerton?" James growled.

"I don't care."

*************************************************************************************

James stood in the room with his wife. She had scrambled for the gun that had been dropped, pointing it at her father

"Sweetie, you don't really want to point that at me?" Charles' voice shook, showing his nerves.

"You blackmailed me." Her voice a low growl. James never heard that sound before coming from his wife. Her lips curling into a sneer. "You didn't even come to me, like a normal father, and ask for help." She said.

"That old bat wouldn't let me near the house."

"Mrs. Hunter?" She asked he nodded his head. "You were afraid of a sick old woman, so you blackmailed me? You almost ruined my life and my son's life."

"To be honest, sweetheart, I didn't think you would be that stubborn." His voice starting to crack. "You take after your mother." He added a nervous laugh.

"Where is my mother?"

"You know your mother's temper." He said.

"I grow tired of this game with you, I want straightforward answers quickly," Christine said. James watched Christine and her father intently. He'd never seen Christine angry with anyone. Her tone made his blood run cold.

"It was Jane." He said. "Your mother got into an argument with Jane in the kitchen. Your mother slapped her, and Jane picked up a knife and stabbed your mother. I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do. Please, Christine. Put down the gun."

"I know everything," Christine said through clenched teeth. "I know what you and mother did to Amelia."

"I had nothing to do with it. Your mother inflicted torture on the poor girl."

"I know what you did. The advances you made on her. Then you sold her to a brothel to pay your gambling debt."

"Sweetheart, please. You don't know the whole story."

"I know enough."

Charles put his hands down. "I've had enough of this. You will give me the gun this instant."

Charles took two steps forward towards Christine. She fired on her father, hitting him in the chest, he dropped to the ground. Christine gasped at what she did. Jack took advantage of her momentary confusion and rushed towards her. James stood helplessly watching the events unfold in front of him. Quickly Christine turned the gun on Jack and shot him without hesitation. She dropped the gun on the floor as her hands shook, two men lay dead at her feet. James heard a woman scream from across the hall. James picked the gun up quickly.

"What did I do?" Christine whimpered.

Pulling Christine into his arms James said, "Nothing." He kissed the top of her head.

"I just..."

"Lord Winthrop fought me for control of the gun. It went off by accident."

"James, I know what I did."

"You did nothing. I did it. I accidentally shot your father and then Jack tried to attack us. I did what I had to do to protect you and our child."

"I will not let you take the blame for this."

"Christine, I know what you did, but let me protect you." Christine nodded and rested her head on his chest. "Now, what happened?" He asked her.

"You fought my father for control of the gun. It went off by accident."

"And then?"

"Jack rushed over to us and you shot him to protect us."

"Good girl." He whispered kissing her brow. "And when you are asked what happened tonight, that is what you will tell everyone. Understand?"

"I can't let you lie for me."

"Yes, you can. I won't let you be carted off by a constable to answer questions all night."

Before she could protest the door opened. Anabel entered the room followed by two officers.

"It was an accident." Christine cried.

"There, there," James said holding her tighter. "It's all over now."

"If you don't mind, sir." The constable said. "Is there a place we can sit down and speak about what transpired here?"

Christine, still shaking, nodded her head. She composed herself enough to lead everyone down to the kitchen. Anabel helped light a fire, Sally sat beside it with George hovering close by. James sat Christine down and took a seat next to her. She leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder. James was surprised by the calm in her voice as she answered the questions.

"You don't seem that upset that your husband shot your father."

"My father was an awful man. He was blackmailing me, my cousins, and several other members of London society. He and his companions kidnaped a friend of mine for ransom. I am not sorry he is gone, but I am sorry in the manner it happened."

"One last question." The constable said. "Where is Lady Winthrop?"

"Why don't you ask Jane?" Christine said.

Christine turned her head and stared at Jane. "Perhaps Jane could answer that question better than we can." Jane squirmed in her chair under Christine's gaze. Christine did not move as she stared at the maid. "Go ahead, Jane. Tell the inspector what happened to my mother."

"I stabbed her with a kitchen knife," Jane said. "She hit me, and I stabbed her. She bled to death over in the corner. Charles helped me throw her body down into the cellar." Jane pointed to a dark stain in the corner of the kitchen.

"I'm satisfied with that answer." The constable said. The constable in the kitchen helped Jane to her feet and led her to the front door.

"Constable," James said. "It is late, my wife is exhausted and so are the other ladies. Are we free to go home?"

"The ladies are free to go home, but if you two gentlemen would come back with me."

"No" Christine cried. "I won't let them take you away."

"Don't worry, darling. I'll be home before you know it." James gave her a reassuring squeeze and slowly rose to his feet. "Allow me to walk my wife to our carriage and we will be ready to go." He said calmly.

The constable nodded his head and the party left the crumbling Winthrop townhome silently.

*************************************************************************************

"I'm not sure how you'd like me to respond to this question," James replied doing his best to keep his voice even and calm. "You have asked me the same question several times this evening and each time I've given you the same answer." He groaned.

"Were just trying to make sure we have all the facts regarding Lord Winthrop's murder." The constable said.

"Yes, I understand. I've told you what happened when we were at the townhome. My wife told you what happened. And I have lost track of how many times you have asked me since I've been here. Now are you going to charge me with something, or do you believe me when I tell you that it was an accident."

"Are you sure it was an accident? It seems that a man of your size could easily have overpowered Lord Winthrop."

"Yes," James stated. "It was an accident. I was afraid he might hurt my wife."

"You were afraid that Lord Winthrop would hurt his own daughter."

"That man was disgusting. He didn't care who he hurt to get what he wanted. He was blackmailing her and other family members."

"Alright, Lord Prescot." The constable said. "You say it was an accident and the only witness in the room attests to it being an accident, there is nothing more I can do here tonight."

"Then I am free to go," James said.

"Yes, if we have any more questions, we will stop by to see you."

James rose from the table and headed out of the holding area to the lobby. A sleepy George Southerton was waiting for him.

"Did they just release you as well?" James asked.

"No, they were done with me hours ago. I waited for you."

"Why?"

"We took my carriage here, remember? I wanted to make sure you got home."

"I could have hired someone."

"Can you just let me help you," George said slowly standing up. "I know you don't like me, and I don't care why."

James started walking out of the station. "Because you are a pompous fool and you have hurt a friend of the family."

George followed him. "I am not pompous. Well, not as pompous as you were before you wed Christine." He said. "And the argument between Sally and me, I'm trying to make that right."

"You better..."

"Or what, you'll call me out? Defend her honor? I'm going to ask her again to marry me."

James stopped in his tracks and turned to face George. "And what if she refuses you again? What if she has tired of you? What will you do then?" James watched George; the color drained from his face. He could see that George had considered that very possibility.

"I hope it doesn't come to that," George replied looking at his feet.

"Fine, where is this damn carriage of yours. I want to get home to Christine. She was probably up all night with worry."

George pointed the way and they sat down in the silence of his carriage. James thought about what to say to him. He thought about offering false hope, or some other type of encouragement, but the right words did not come out.

"Come around for supper tonight," James said. "I'll make sure the two of you get to speak privately."

"Thank you." George replied as James left the carriage.

*************************************************************************************

Months had passed quickly for James and his family. He aided Miss Potter in one of her hair-brained schemes to get the stubborn Sally to wed George Southerton. He laughed when he thought about the former pickpocket now turned fancy lady. Shortly after that wedding, he was asked to give Miss Potter away at her hasty elopement to Mathew Fullcroft. Now she was spending her time galivanting all through Europe with her new husband. Probably coming up with more hair-brained schemes to keep the two of them entertained.

James had stopped hiding in his study. Instead, he would sneak up to the nursery when he was sure Christine wouldn't be in. She had told him he was spending too much time holding the babies and they would never get used to sitting and sleeping on their own. Babies, Christine had given him two healthy twins, one boy, and one girl. He named the boy James Winston Deacon after himself and his father. The little girl, his cherubic little ball, named Pearl, as in precious. He watched the angles sleep peacefully, vowing then and there to show all his children equal love and attention. He never wanted any of them, including Freddy, to feel that their father loved the others more. Pearl twitched in her sleep, letting out a tiny squeak. Picking her up, James walked over to the rocking chair in the corner of the room and sat to rock his little girl.

"Does mama know you are up here again?" Freddy asked. Although he had his own room, Freddy would frequently watch the twins.

"No." He replied. "Don't you have lessons with your governess?" He asked the young boy.

"Later." The boy said shrugging his shoulders. Peal's eyes fluttered open, her gaze focusing on her older brother. She cooed at him and reached her tiny fist towards him. Freddy took the baby's hand and her tiny fingers grasped one of his as she smiled at him. "She's so pink," Freddy said. "Why is she so pink and bald?"

"That is just how babies are," James said.

"How long are you going to stare at them this time?" Freddy asked.

"I don't know." He replied. "I was thinking about taking them downstairs with me today. Maybe keep them in my office while I do some work."

The sound of Eddie clearing her throat made them turn toward the doorway. "Master Fredric, it is past time you eat your breakfast, and then you need to wash up before lessons."

"Yes, grandmother." The boy ran up to her and hugged her. He was under the impression that Eddie was James' mother. Neither Eddie nor James ever corrected the boy.

"And what are you doing, bothering the babies?" Little Pearl let out another squeal just as her younger brother let out a cry. "Oh," Eddie said turning to the baby in the crib. "You are cranky just like your papa." She picked him up, rubbing his back. "You are going to spoil her if you if you keep picking her up like that," Eddie warned.

"She was awake, I picked her up. I didn't want her to wake her brother." James said.

"Likely story."

"Believe what you like, Eddie." He said as he got up and started walking out the door, he met the nanny in the hall. "When they are clean and fed, please bring them to my office." He handed his angel over to the nanny.

"Are you going to spend all day with them again?" Eddie asked.

"Is it wrong for a father to spend the day with his children?"

"No, but..."

"I'd keep Freddy in there with me too, but he has lessons. Maybe he can have his lunch with me?" James mused out loud as he headed to see what Christine was up to.

Stopping in his wife's little office he saw Christine was sitting at her desk reading through letters. Her back was turned to him and he kissed her on the back of her neck. Christine jumped with surprise.

"Do many men sneak into your chamber to give you kisses?" He teased.

"You gave me a start, James." She replied. "I was reading over this letter from Amelia. Pearl has run off."

"With someone?" He asked confused that he hadn't heard anything from his brother on a possible suiter for their sister.

Christine turned to face her husband. "They don't know."

"How do they not know?" He questioned.

"She left them a letter stating that she was going off on her own."

"This makes no sense. She has not left Robert's side since he found her." He said, he felt guilt gnaw in the pit of his stomach. "Did she take anything? Money, clothing?"

"Amelia said that Pearl's room was empty, but they never noticed any trunks leaving the house. She must have been doing it quietly." She looked back down at her letters and flipped through them. "Here, this one was mixed with mine by mistake. It's from Pearl. Maybe she has left some clue?"

James took the letter from his wife, ripping the envelope open. 'No' was neatly scrawled in Pearl's handwriting. He looked up at Christine and shook his head handing the letter back to her. "What do I tell Eddie?"

"Tell me what?" Eddie smiled from the doorway, a plump pink baby in her arms. Christine got up and picked up her baby from Eddie's arms offering and a nervous smile.

"Eddie, come with me downstairs." He said as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder. "We need to talk."
