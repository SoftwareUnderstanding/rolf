### Introduction

### This was written in 2009 after The Dark Knight and Superman Returns. I knew that after I watched Superman Returns that there was a good chance that they would reboot the series and I'm glad they did. After watching Man of Steel, which I liked, I realized that although this was an adequate story for a live action movie it was impossible to use this story, so it was pretty much worthless but a good read, enjoy.

### Also, I used abbreviations wherever I could; SM is Superman, BM is Batman, LL is Lex Luthor, etc. I was rolling when I started this, it only took me a few weeks so I was trying to save time

### Justice League

### The Movie

### This takes place after a second Superman movie and possibly after a third Batman movie has been made. It may also be necessary for the release of the Green Lantern and Wonder Woman movie. John Jonz will be mentioned in the third Batman installment and The Flash can be mentioned in one of the others, probably Superman.

### As the film begins you see clips from a very popular talk show, the Gordon Godfrey show. The Larry King type show is geared against the recent up swing in the number of super heroes. The listener audience calls in and asks questions to the panel one of which is Superman. Another is Colonel King Faraday, assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As the intro credits roll different audience members chime in.

### G. Godfrey

### We now are going to Metropolis, your question caller.

### Caller #1

### Who pays for the damage? I mean I know that you guys help but who pays for the street repair when you drill a big hole in it?

### Superman

### Well sir, we try not to do any damage, but in that case there was a ruptured gas line that was about to.....

### G. Godfrey

### Face it you guys do more harm than good. I have a question for the man of steel. How many super villains were there before you guys showed up?

### Superman

### Well, I don't see the point in that question Mr. Godfrey.

### G. Godfrey

### We have you here in Metropolis. There is that murderer in Gotham, dressed like a bat...

### Superman

### (Interrupting)

### Batman was cleared of all of those charges. The Joker admitted to all of those murders, he wasn't about to let anyone else take credit for his crimes.

### G. Godfrey

### Yeah and he has escaped again, Batman is doing a great job (sarcastically)

### Superman

### And he will catch him again.

### G. Godfrey

### Go ahead Marvin from Central City

### Marvin

### Yeah I agree. This dude Flash ran by my aunt's house last week and he was runnin so fast that he blew her awning off. I had to fix that (bleep) myself.

### G. Godfrey

### Now Marvin you can't say that, we are on a delay but you can't say that.

### Marvin

### Now we got this green dude flying around knockin' stuff over with his ring. When is enough enough?

### Now we have to pay higher taxes.

### Faraday

### Let me answer that. We are still getting used to this new phenomenon. Your government is very grateful to what these heroes are doing. We are also grateful that there are citizens like Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne that have set up foundations to help pay for some of these repairs.

### G. Godfrey

### And we are all grateful too, but I return to my original question, there were no super villains here before these guys so doesn't it stand to reason that if the super heroes go away then the bad guys will too?

### Superman

### I think that is a bit over-simplified,

### (he continues to talk and fades as the you then see a highlight from the news on a television in a shack by some docks)

### Reporter on television

### And that was the tone of the interview last night as Superman tried to defend his peers in the face of growing frustration over the rise in super human activities.

### You then see Batman fly over and land on a nearby roof.

### Gotham City docks late night

### Batman enters the warehouse after disengaging the security system from an opening in the roof. He sees several shadowy creatures and then hears the voice of the gangster he has been investigating. He then hears the familiar voice of another,

### G. Godfrey

### This should be the final load Manheim.

### Manheim

### It is. After this we will begin phase two and I hope you guys know what you are doing because I have no idea how to make this stuff work.

### G. Godfrey

### He will take care of that.

### As Manheim's men finish their work Batman is stooped on a cross beam above them recording the conversation. He then feels a presence behind him. He delivers a back kick from the squatting position to the levitating beast who then growls in pain and falls to the floor.

### Manheim

### What the hell?

### He then sees the silhouette of Batman coming towards them.

### Batman crashes down on the shoulders of another beast to break his fall. He then takes out three of Manheim's men.

### Godfrey

### Damn you Manheim, I thought you said this location was secure. Get the stuff and let's go!

### As Manheim goes for a bag on the table Batman throws one of the gangsters into the table shattering it and knocking the bag over and a few items fall out.

### Godfrey

### Damnit! Hold on.

### He then removes a transmitter from his coat pocket and enters a code. A bright light flashes and temporarily blinds Batman because he was using night vision. He recovers in time to see Manheim, Godfrey, the flying beasts carrying the others, vanish in the portal and then it vanishes.

### Batman surveys the scene and discovers three items. One of them lights up his face in the dark with a greenish glow. Batman fires his cable towards the roof. He then enters a code into the panel on his left wrist. The Bat jet appears hovering over the warehouse.

### Later that night you see the Bat Jet making several low passes over the city of Metropolis.

### Batman looks to his left and sees Superman beside him. Superman motions for Batman to follow him.

### They land at a secluded warehouse district.

### They approach each other cautiously, sizing each other up.

### Superman

### What brings you to Metropolis?

### Batman

### I'm working a case and I came across a few clues that you may be able to shed some light on.

### (He pulls out the transmitter.)

### This is alien. Have you seen anything like this before?

### Superman

### (Looking over the box)

### How do you know it's alien?

### Batman

### A Martian told me.

### Superman

### (Looking up a bit surprised)

### So he is for real?

### Batman slightly grins and nods

### Superman

### I'll look into it and get back to you.

### Batman

### I need to know as soon as possible.

### Superman

### Why the urgency?

### Batman

### Something big is going to happen. I may have bought us a few days.

### Superman

### Us? Other than this transmitter what does it have to do with me?

### Batman

### (pulling a small lead case from his belt)

### This.

### He opens it as Superman quickly steps back he then closes it.

### Superman

### Where did you get that?

### Batman

### Warehouse in Gotham. Along with this.

### (he holds up a gold coin)

### It's a Spanish doubloon. Not sure how old I need to analyze it.

### Superman is still thinking about the kryptonite, he motions towards Batman's belt.

### Superman

### You better let me have that.

### Batman does not react

### Superman

### (irritated)

### I can just take it but I don't think you'll like it. So just give it to me.

### Batman

### If you try to take it you won't like how I give it to you.

### (Batman cuts off Superman as he begins to speak)

### Listen, I need you more than you need me. If you were up to something you and I would have butted heads a long time ago.

### Superman

### That must have hurt; I heard you were a loner.

### Batman

### I have a hunch that this is bigger than both of us.

### Superman

### Tell me what you know.

### Batman

### I have been tracking a mafia boss with Metropolis ties, by the name of Manheim.

### Superman

### Yeah I know him.

### Batman

### He has been buying large quantities of deep sea drilling equipment. Earlier tonight I broke up a meeting he was having with G. Gordon Godfrey.

### Superman

### The talk show host?

### Batman

### (nods)

### As Batman continues Superman stares at Batman's mask using his x ray vision

### Batman

### The components in the warehouse were pumping equipment, the final phase of any large scale drilling operation. And if the amount of equipment is an indication, they are planning to drill a very big hole.

### (Batman notices what Superman is trying to do)

### You are not going to find out that way.

### Superman

### (grinning)

### A lead lined cowl? That is a bit dangerous. Did you wear that just for me?

### Batman

### Not just for you, according to the Martian, Godfrey is using mind control. That is why he is so popular and we aren't.

### Superman

### Did you question him or Manheim?

### Batman

### They used one of those transmitters and got away. I have never seen anything like it.

### Superman

### Got away, huh? Didn't get a chance to beat an answer out of them?

### Batman takes a slight step forward, Superman interrupts

### Superman

### I have not always agreed with your methods but I have always agreed with your results.

### Batman

### You have your show to run, I have mine.

### Superman grins as Batman turns toward his jet and flies off into the night. Superman returns to his fortress of solitude and uses his crystals to summon Braniac, the information system used on the former planet of Krypton.

### The next day Bruce Wayne is having a press conference at the Wayne Industries building about the company's plan to begin a space division.

### Clark Kent is there for the daily planet. Bruce fields questions along with Lucius Fox. As the press conference winds down Clark asks the question that everyone wanted to ask but were afraid to.

### Kent

### Mr. Wayne can you respond to the reports that Chinese spies were uncovered within the staff of Wayne Enterprises Space Research Division?

### The crowd becomes still as all of the cameras are focused on Bruce waiting for his reaction.

### Wayne

### (calmly placing his hands in his pockets, smiling as he answers)

### That is a private matter, as well as a sensitive one. We turned everything over to the government to assist in their investigation. The Daily Planet doesn't need to know everything Mr. Kent.

### Kent

### Then what about our readers, do they get to know everything?

### Wayne

### (irritated)

### I have provided every bit of information that has been asked of me, Wayne Enterprises is a private company Mr. Kent. Did the Daily Planet send you hear to ask those questions? Maybe you should ask about how much this new venture is going to benefit the world.

### Kent

### (shrugging)

### Well, you have your show to run, and I have mine.

### Bruce is stunned, he quickly ends the press conference and talks to Lucious as they leave the stage.

### Wayne

### Clark Kent requested an exclusive interview last month right?

### Fox

### Mmm Hmm

### Wayne

### Get a car, send him to Wayne manor. Get back to your lab and wait for my call. I'll know more after I speak to Kent. You might have to clear your schedule for the next few days.

### Fox

### (looks concerned)

### Anything I need to be aware of Mr. Wayne?

### Wayne

### I'll let you know. If something is going to happen it will be soon.

### Fox

### Are we talking days or weeks?

### Wayne

### Maybe hours.

### Fox and Wayne seperate as Wayne walks to the parking deck where Alfred waits by the open back door of the car.

### Thirty minutes later Clark Kent arrives at Wayne Manor, Alfred comes to the door.

### Alfred

### Good day Mr. Kent. Master Wayne is expecting you. This way.

### Bruce is standing in a side library towards the end of the hall.

### Alfred

### Mr. Kent sir.

### Wayne

### Thanks Alfred

### (Kent stands quietly as Bruce looks him over)

### Wayne

### So what did you find out about the transmitter?

### Kent is visibly stunned. He then starts to realize what is happening.

### (They approach each other as if they are sizing one another up)

### Kent

### I had my suspicisions. But I was not sure.

### Wayne

### How?

### Kent

### I have started to learn the differences in peoples' heartbeats. Yours is slightly different with costume. Is that intentional?

### Wayne

### Trade secrets Mr. Kent.

### The transmitter?

### Kent

### Oh, your friend was right, it is alien. I took the liberty of getting all the information on a disk that should interface with your computer.

### (Wayne taps a book on the shelf; the wall opens to an elevator)

### Wayne

### Follow me.

### They stand in front of the massive screen in the bat cave Bruce is studying the information, Clark waits for him to finish.

### Kent

### I used my database from Krypton and you were right. This is bigger than both of us. The technology is from Apokolips, a planet ruled by Darkseid. It is a hellish planet in a far off solar system. He represents a serious threat to this planet. I think Darksied may have a presence here already.

### Wayne

### Godfrey.

### Kent

### Godfrey. He has been railing against superheroes since he turned up.

### A shape appears rising from the floor, Kent steps back as he lays eyes on the Martian Manhunter J"onn J'onzz.

### Kent looks at Bruce who has a slight grin.

### Wayne

### Clark Kent meet The Martian Manhunter

### J'onn J'onzz, meet Superman

### Kent

### What is this? A coming out party?

### Wayne

### He reads minds, I bet he knew already knew.

### Kent

### (talking to J'onn)

### And you didn't tell him

### JJ

### That would have been rude.

### They shake hands and J'onn begins to speak

### Darkseid has a history with my people, he is searching for the anti- life equation.

### Wayne

### What is that?

### Clark is now standing beside Bruce with his arms folded

### J'onn

### It was an ancient Martian belief that free will exists as a life equation. Darkseid deduced that there must be an Anti- Life equation, or as he believes, the futility of living. He must think that part of the equation exists in humans. He will stop at nothing to find it.

### Kent

### Okay so we know origin of the transmitter, what about the coin and the kryptonite?

### J'onn is studying the coin

### J'onn

### The coin is from Atlantis.

### (Clark and Bruce look up at the same time)

### Wayne

### How do you know?

### JJ

### I have been there. I was curious so I shape shifted and was there for almost an entire day before I was asked to leave.

### Wayne

### Who asked you to leave?

### JJ

### He did. His telepathic powers are developing. He communicates with sea creatures. I think he sensed me.

### Wayne

### Can you "show" me what you saw?

### JJ

### (nods)

### Be still.

### He places his hands on the sides of Bruce's head. The Martians' eyes glow to a bright red. Bruce closes his eyes and takes a deep breath as the images enter his mind.

### After a few seconds later JJ's eyes dim and he releases Bruce's

### head.

### Bruce rubs his forehead as he processes the information, JJ catches Clark staring at him, when he notices he clears his throat and looks away.

### Wayne

### I have to warn him.

### Kent

### Who?

### Wayne

### Aquaman

### Kent

### Why? Don't call him that by the way. His name is Arthur; he helped me with a rescue in the Bering Sea last year.

### Wayne

### I thought he hates the surface dwellers.

### Kent

### Oh he does. His concern was the fuel spilling from the boat. He used these two whales to..... anyway, why Atlantis?

### Wayne

### I think Darkseid is planning an invasion. And according to the information you provided and the fact that he is using all of this drilling equipment he plans to tap into the Earth's core and make it like Apokolips.

### Clark is not sold on that theory right away

### Kent

### Oookay, but why Atlantis?

### Wayne

### If he can surprise them then he can drill his hole undetected.

### (Clark turns to JJ)

### Kent

### You have been there, does he have the ability to repel an invasion?

### JJ

### Yes. He has the technology to take over the entire planet if he chooses. He wants to be left alone, that and ..... well, you.

### Kent

### Me?

### JJ

### Yes, he does no want a fight with you.

### Wayne

### Right, which leads to the third item, the kryptonite. Darkseid very well may think that you need to be taken out first. You may be the only thing in the universe that can stand up to him.

### Kent

### If that's the case a battle between he and I could destroy the planet.

### Wayne

### No planet, no spoils.

### (Clark turns away; JJ places his hand on his shoulder)

### JJ

### I sense much fear in you. Fear of the unknown extent of your powers. From the fear of punching too hard to the fear of a hand shake that may be too firm. You fear your powers because you do not know their limits. You do not know their limits because you have not faced anything or anyone that can challenge them. Facing Darkseid will make you confront that fear.

### Clark looks at Bruce with a slight grin

### Kent

### He's good

### Wayne

### Would like to hear what he has to say about me

### (JJ begins to speak Bruce interrupts)

### Wayne

### Rhetorical

### Bruce walks toward the vault in the corner of the room and you can see the cowl, as he is dressing he removes the case marked "deep sea kit"

### He meets Superman and JJ in front of the massive computer. He opens a small case and removes a small hearing aid device and gives one to each of them. Clark has changed also.

### BM

### I had to guess at the level so I made a few modifications for sensitivity.

### (As SM looks at his)

### I am going to Atlantis.

### SM

### Maybe I should go, he does know me

### BM

### (loading equipment in the jet)

### If you look in that case you will find more com links, use J'onn's abilities along with your own and round up some help. I have been trying to hail Green Lantern for the past week, no luck.

### SM

### J'onn you get Dinah. I will also go see our friend in Central City.

### BM

### That guy is a goof ball.

### SM

### I think the fastest man on the planet may come in handy.

### BM

### So he did beat you

### SM

### I think he did. Well it was for charity, we were both running so fast. Unfortunately there isn't a camera on the planet that can tell for sure.

### (Batman walks over to the keyboard, grinning. He pulls up a photograph of The Flash and Superman Crossing the finish line, The Flash is a half a step ahead)

### JJ

### Chuckles

### (Superman stares up at the screen smiling)

### SM

### Impressive. But how do you plan to get into Atlantis?

### BM

### Quietly. And you need to focus on Darkseid and the kryptonite. That stuff is not that hard to weaponize, trust me.

### SM

### What does that mean?

### BM

### Your buddy Lexx was doing it. Remember that explosion at one of his facilities last month?

### SM

### Yeah

### BM

### That is what he was making. (pulls up a computerized image on the screen in the shape of a rifle) I couldn't trace any of it back to him. With the exception of him(motions to JJ) Luthor may be the smartest person on the planet.

### SM

### So tell me Bruce, did you keep any of those weapons before you blew up the building?

### BM

### I'm always prepared, Clark, just like that jet. The cock pit doubles as a stealth, one man submarine that I have successfully delivered to and retrieved from Atlantis by remote control.

### SM

### So you have a weapon against Aquaman too?

### What do you have for J'onn?

### BM

### A book of matches

### (Superman turns to JJ in disbelief)

### JJ

### Not anymore I'm working on that.

### SM

### (turning back to BM)

### I thought you said trust was not an issue. What about Wonder Woman. Flash, or Lantern? What do you have cooked up for them?

### BM

### Lantern can be countered with yellow energy. A gravity disruptor, which I haven't developed should neutralize the Flash. Wonder Woman...., well, you I guess. I do not know enough about her.

### SM

### Listen to yourself. you can't be ...

### BM

### (pointing to the screen)

### That weapon was created by your worst enemy. That weapons greatest power was its secrecy. He can produce thousands of those in a week. I made sure that he knew one was taken intact. He will never make one again.

### Your code for this computer is 002. You can look at everything I have.

### BM returns to the room on the other side of the cage to retrieve more equipment.

### SM

### (speaking softly to JJ)

You can't be okay with this. He has made plans to take us out? He's made plans for everyone but him. What is his weapon against himself?

### JJ

### I am the last of my kind. I do not take his trust in me lightly. He has given us the keys to his domain. (raising his arms) everything we need to beat him is right here in this cave. His weapon against himself is us.

### We need to focus on the task at hand.

### SM

### You're right. (turns to BM) What's your plan Batman?

### BM

### The only way Atlantis is vulnerable is from sabotage. The gold coin would seem to suggest that money has changed hands. Someone has been paid off. Through Wayne Tech's new space research division I noticed some energy spikes with a hyperspace signature. I checked the data from last night and there was a spike five minutes after Manheim and his goons disappeared. So if they are giving off a signal after they leave then they should give off a signal before they come.

### SM

### Five minutes?

### BM

### I know, I should be able to use it to my advantage, surprise attacks and sabotage are based on timing.

### SM

### (nods)

### How long has your deep space equipment been up and running?

### BM  
Two months

### SM

### How many spikes in two months?

### BM

### Two hundred and thirty one.

### (they all look at one another)

### SM

### There is no telling how many advanced agents they have here already.

### JJ

### If they did I could sense them and I haven't yet. Except for Godfrey.

### (BM starts the engines)

### BM

### I'll be in touch

### A large wall seals off the rest of the bat cave as the jet hovers and then vanishes in the tunnel

### SM

### We better get to work

### Superman and JJ start out to gather their friends. JJ plans to contact Wonder Woman and The Green Lantern telepathically. They will meet back at the bat cave.

### Meanwhile over the Atlantic Ocean Batman prepares for his dive. The jet comes to a hover just feet above the surface. Large airbags deploy from the nose and the wings and the plane comes to rest. Batman then opens the deep sea kit and places a device over the inside of his left arm and plugs the cords and hoses into the control panel of the cockpit. He winces as the needles inside the device insert automatically into his arteries. A green light clicks on and the computer tells him that his suit is pressurized. He then checks the bio sensor readout on the screen to make sure that the device is administering the right amount of gasses into his blood stream for the dive.

### BM

### Superman, do you copy.

### SM

### Go ahead Batman

### BM

### I am about to commence the dive, if anything happens, remember your code.

### SM

### 002. Right. I can only guess who has 001.

### BM

### (manages a smile)

### Any luck finding our friends?

### SM

### John has contacted Wonder Woman. I'm on my way to Central City. Still no word from Lantern.

### BM

### Good luck

### SM

### You too. You're going to need it more than me. Are you sure about this?

### BM

### Yeah, thanks.

### Batman activates the countdown sequence. The computer counts down and the mini sub deploys and slips below the surface. The sub dives at a steep angle. Batman begins to feel the pressure and continues to monitor his vital signs. The computer counts out the distance to target. Batman struggles to stay conscience as the pressure builds. His nose begins to bleed as he realizes that no human has ever been that deep before.

### Super hovers high above Central City looking down he spots a crimson streak moving through the city and streaks down

### The Flash is speeding to a bank on the other side of town, When he arrives he finds the robbers all disarmed and inside their getaway car which has been crushed so they can not escape. He looks up to see Superman descending slowly.

### SM

### I thought you were never late?

### Flash

### Well these guys were smart. They planted six bombs throughout the city. I had to disarm them first.

### SM

### well if you are done here. We need your help.

### Flash

### Who's we?

### SM

### Myself, Batman and some others. Have you heard from Green Lantern?

### Flash

### Nah, that guy seems to be off planet more and more these days.

### Superman hands him the communicator.

### SM

### Take this, we need you in Gotham as soon as possible.

### Flash places it in his ear. Superman looks away in reaction to a sound that only he can hear.

### SM

### Are you sure you got all of the bombs?

### F

### Yeah pretty sure.

### Superman stares into the distance.

### SM

### There is a gas station fire on the other side of the city.

### F

### I'm on it. I'll catch up, see you in Gotham.

### Flash streaks away as Superman flies off.

### Atlantis

### Docking bay

### The facility is enclosed in an energy field. Outgoing and incoming Atlantian vehicles enter or exit through this area. Batman has timed the opening of the bay doors and the sub quietly attaches itself to the bottom of an incoming Atlantian patrol ship. The ship enters the bay and the mini sub subtly surfaces. Batman is slumped over in the cockpit as the computer states that the pressure has been equalized.

### Docking bay guard

### Colonel Brack! Behold, a surface ship.

### Colonel Brak and a handful of guards approach the sub and the cockpit opens.

### CB

### Get him out, and see if he is still alive. Notify Lord Arthur that we have an intruder.

### Batman is pulled from the sub and when his helmet is removed blood spills out

### BM

### (barely coherent being held upright by two guards)

### I need to see prince Arthur now.

### CB

### You are in no position to make demands.

### BM

### Get him down here I have an urgent message. Tell him I will give him something in exchange for his audience.

### CB

### What could you possibly have that we want?

### BM

### The technology I used to sneak this vessel into this facility, twice.

### (Batman hands Col Brack a device similar to a flip phone)

### Brack looks at Batman

### BM

### Do I have your word?

### CB

### I'll just wait for you to die and see it anyway.

### (he opens the device and it along with the sub light up and a warning alarm starts. "Self destruct sequence started. Enter code now. Detonation in 3 minutes."

### CB

### (intensely looking at Batman)

### BM

### You have three minutes.

### CB  
Get that thing out of here!

### An Atlantian soldier tries to enter the cockpit to pilot the craft out of the loading bay and a surge of electricity drops him to his knees.

### CB

### (into his communicator)

### My Lord we need you in the docking bay now!

### My Lord!

### (OS AM's voice)

### I am here Colonel.

### Aquaman approaches and Batman sees him for the first time. He is as big as Superman. His long blond hair and beard are a contrast to his green pants and cloak.

### Batman musters all his strength to stand before the prince of Atlantis.

### AM

### You are the Batman, yes?

### Batman nods and enters a code on his wrist control and you hear, "self destruct sequence terminated."

### BM

### Your code is 005

### AM

### What?

### Batman collapses into Aquaman's arms.

### AM

### Take him to the infirmary now!

### Get the technicians in here to begin studying this.

### (Pointing to the sub)

### Batman wakes to see himself surrounded by Atlantian soldiers in some type of hospital. He struggles to raise his head to find Aquaman.

### AM

### Easy surface dweller. We had to restart your heart twice.

### Batman quickly stirs

### BM

### How long have I been out?

### AM

### About an hour.

### BM

### (sitting up quickly regaining his conscience and strength)

### What did you do to me?

### AM

### You are not the first surface dweller to be here. Contrary to popular belief we have saved many of you in the past.

### Batman looks around and begins to orientate himself

### AM

### (tells the others to leave the room)

### You risked your life to warn me. My technicians have informed me that you did not have enough life support to return to the surface. I am honored by your bravery. Your actions reflect your reputation.

### BM

### Yes the .....

### AM

### Invasion? Yes we are making the necessary preparations.

### (Aquaman holds up the device that Batman made for him.)

### AM

### When your heart stopped a pouch on your belt opened and I retrieved this. You planned to deliver your message dead or alive. It does beg a question, what if you had died before you could see me?

### Batman removes a sliver of paper from under the forehead area of his cowl with the number 005 written on it.

### Aquaman lets out a laugh

### BM

### That device will also give a signal when the hyperspace incursion occurs.

### Has it signaled?

### Aquaman shakes his head.

### BM

### Are you ready for the attack?

### Aquaman calmly nods

### AM

### How do you feel my friend?

### BM

### Fine. Aqua....

### (Aquaman raises his eyebrows)

### Lord Arthur do you understand what is about to happen?

### Aquaman calmly nods

### AM

### We will be fine. Can you walk?

### (Batman nods and then stands)

### Good come with me.

### Batman follows Aquaman through the magnificent facility. Troops are running through the halls preparing for the invasion. They enter the command center and Aquaman tells everyone to leave.

### AM

### Your analysis was absolutely correct. We are vulnerable to sabotage. And an attack like the one coming, an attack we have never seen before, we would have but one protocol. I have sensed a plot against me for the past several months. You are the only one I can trust. When this goes off(holding up the device from Batman's belt) You and I will enter that door and put down what ever is on the other side.

### BM

### Is their another way in?

### AM

### Yes, that duct.

### (Pointing to the ceiling)

### BM

### Well they may expect someone to come through the door.

### (The device starts beeping)

### Batman fires a rope to the ceiling, he puts his arm around Aquaman and they both ascend toward the duct, Aquaman quietly removes the cover and they both slip inside.

### Looking in the room they see two dozen traitors and someone that Aquaman knows well. The room is full of large pipes. All of the attention of the traitors is directed at the control panel that is on the far wall. It is very noisy.

### AM

### (a quiet growl)

### Orm

### BM

### (Whispers)

### Who?

### AM

### My brother.

### Aquaman removes the other cover and batman uses a hook to hang it on the wall. They are about 50 feet above the soldiers who are watching the door. Orm and Colonel Brack are watching the monitor that shows the main facility that is Atlantis. The regular staff of four men are on their knees, hands in heavy binders behind their backs.

### Orm

### (to Brack)

### All we have to do is keep control of this room. The invaders will do the rest. They have assured me that the only one who will be harmed is the my brother.

### Without control of this room and the numbers they will be sending it will be over in a matter of minutes.

### Brack nods

### Orm

### They will be here any minute, when we get the order we will ignore it.

### CB

### Yes my new King.

### Batman throws three batarangs simultaneously. The noise of the equipment in the room conceals the noise they make as they stick in the pipes above the soldiers.

### BM

### You might want to cover your ears.

### The batarangs are like flash bangs as they go off. Batman and Aquaman leap down and the fight begins. Batman uses a soldier to break his fall, he lands squarely on his shoulders taking him out of the fight. The batarangs took out four soldiers who were still on the floor stunned. Batman then throws four more batarangs at the shackles of the soldiers that explode on impact. They retrieve their swords and enter the fight. Aquaman goes directly for Orm as he ignores the slicing swipes of the other traitors. Bleeding, his trident locks with Orm's sword. Brack goes after Batman. He swings wildly at Batman who manages to avoid the slashing.

### CB

### I should have let you die surface dweller!

### BM

### You're right, you should have.

### AM

### You will pay with your life brother! Why did you betray me?!

### Orm

### Lord Darkseid will make me ruler of this planet when he is finished with it. Something we should have done a long time ago. Now he will do it for us.

### The surface dwellers will molest us no more!

### AM

### FOOL! I have seen Darkseid's plan. He intends to make this world like his.

### Orm

### SO! Our enemies will be dead!

### AM

### SO WILL WE! THERE ARE NO OCEANS ON APOKOLIPS!

### Orm freezes giving Aquaman his opening. As Orm raises his sword Aquaman hurls his trident and impales Orms arm to the wall. He drops his sword and cries out in pain. Batman avoids Brack and disarms him. He fires a rope at his feet, pulling him to the floor after it wrapped around his ankles several times. He then fires another rope at a pipe at the top of the ceiling. He raises himself upwards as he takes Brack with him. He then secures Brack to the pipe and lowers himself to the floor just as the freed soldiers are finishing off the rest of the traitors.

### Aquaman turns to Batman and nods. They approach the screen.

### AM

### (turns to the free soldiers)

### Secure this room and await my command.

### As Batman walks with Aquaman to the control center the building shakes followed by the rumble of thunder.

### BM

### They're here.

### They stand in the control center watching as the circles of light fill the massive dome. Seconds later hovering tank like machines emerge. Two barrels each. Then thousands of parademons swarm from the holes filling Atlantis with their shrill like cries. Hundreds of tanks are now in the dome and the massive cargo ship carrying the drilling equipment lands in the center square.

### BM

### What ever weapon is controlled from that room you better use it now.

### AM

### (calmly)

### Not yet.

### The parademons swarm about, one stops in front of the window and hovers in front of Aquaman. It lets out a scream as others come to the window. The blasts that fire from their weapons bounce off the window with no effect. A tank approaches.

### On the square Godfrey and Manheim start to oversee the unloading of the drilling equipment.

### Manheim

### Looks like our friend came through

### Godfrey

### Of course he did. It appears the inhabitants here plan to surrender. They are not fighting back.

### Manheim

### Yeah, well make sure those flyin freaks keep lookin'. I don't like it.

### BM

### Arthur. What are you waiting for?

### The tank approaches and stops in front of the window, the parademons fly out of the way.

### AM

### (Pressing a button on the control panel)

### Now.

### Batman looks up and starts to grin as he realizes what is about to happen.

### The tank in front of the window vanishes in a wall of water that crashes down from the roof. Aquaman and Batman watch as the entire city fills with water. The parademons along with the tanks can not swim or function under water.

### Manheim

### (looking up)

### Son of a........

### Godfrey grabs a crate and hangs on for dear life it floats upward and he vanishes into a flash of light.

### In the control center Aquaman turns to Batman

### AM

### No water on Apokolips. This is what happens to those who attack an underwater facility and can't swim.

### Batman nods and realizes that he has a new friend a new friend that he may need.

### Apokolips

### You see Godfrey dripping wet on his knees from over the shoulder of an ominous figure, looking upwards in terror.

### Darkseid

### Your plan has failed Godfrey.

### Godfrey

### I..I'm sorry my lord. I do not know what happened.

### DS

### I lost an entire legion in your foolish plan.

### Voice off screen

### What do we do now father?

### DS

### Observe the price of failure.

### Darkseid's eyes glow red as his omega beam fires Godfrey starts to scream as steam comes off of his drenched suit. Godfrey screams and then vanishes in a cloud of smoke.

### DS

### (turning to face his motley collection of officers)

### We will eliminate the Kryptonian first and then take Earth.

### Darkseid turns to face Desaad as he approaches

### DS

### How long before we will be ready

### Desaad

### Well my lord, the drilling in Atlantis was to take a week.

### DS

### Well, we are no longer drilling, are we?

### Desaad

### Two days master

### Darkseid turns away and stares to the sky

### DS

### Very well, Earth has two more days.

### Batman and Aquaman walk towards Batman's vessel that is still in the docking bay.

### AM

### We studied your craft, my technicians were not able to figure out how you entered the docking bay.

### BM

### Oh, sorry.

### (Batman opens his belt and hands Aquaman another device, he holds it up and examines it)

### It's a sonar disruptor.

### (Aquaman nods, a little disgusted, as if he had been tricked)

### I was not sure what was going to happen, that could have been my only ticket out of here.

### (Batman examines the cockpit of his sub and notices the modifications that have been made)

### AM

### My technicians have modified your life support system. You no longer need to be concerned about ascending too quickly.

### Aquaman then hands Batman a breathing device

### AM

### This apparatus will allow you to descend to this depth again. It is a simple model, if you need to modify it.

### BM

### Thank you.

### AM

### No, thank you Batman, you helped me save my throne. More importantly you saved my kingdom. I am in your debt.

### BM

### I will need something

### (Batman reaches into his belt and gives Aquaman a transmitter)

### Can you deliver one of those tanks to the surface? I will have Superman pick it up.

### AM

### Of course

### Batman extends his hand, looks Aquaman in the eyes, they shake.

### BM

### Prince Arthur, Thank you, and I apologize for the intrusion, I hope you understand. I'm sure your technicians discovered that there were no explosives in my ship. I never intended to harm anyone here.

### AM

### (chuckles)

### I was not going to mention that. You risked your life to warn us, I will never forget that. And you may call me Aquaman, Bruce.

### (Aquaman continues to shake as Batman is visibly stunned)

### AM

### I was outside the walls the night your sub was returning from Atlantis. I followed it to the underwater entrance of what I guess is your Bat cave? Which happens to lead to Wayne manor?

### (Batman nods and manages a grin)

### Don't worry your secret is safe with me

### BM

### Thank you, I cannot promise you the same.

### (Aquaman pulls his hand away)

### I'm sorry but this impending attack will be global. We will need everyone that can fight, to fight. I have to inform the government. We will need their help as well. I will tell them no more than I have to.

### Aquaman ponders for a second

### AM

### I understand

### Batman secures himself in the cockpit and canopy seals and it turns in the bay as the door opens, it then slips underwater and heads back to the surface.

### BM

### (on the radio)

### Superman, come in.

### SM

### Go ahead Batman

### BM

### I am having one of Darkseid's weapons delivered to the surface. I'm going to need you to pick it up. It will have a super high frequency beacon. I have a secure warehouse in Gotham after you get it call me and I will tell you how to get there. How are we on the recruiting?

### SM

### I found Flash, J'onn caught up with Wonder Woman. Still no word from Lantern.

### BM

### I'll meet you at the warehouse.

### Batman looks at the monitor and notices he is getting closer to the blip on the screen.

### The floating remainder of the jet moves with the rolling ocean. The sub emerges under the opening and then is winched into position. You hear "Docking complete"

### The engines fire and the vertical thrusters stabilize the jet. The flotation devices detach and the jet turns. Batman turns to see the tank floating beside an Atlantian craft. Aquaman is standing on top of it. Batman gives a slight salute, Aquaman nods. His men swim over and attach the tank to the floating platform.

### AM

### Good luck surface dweller.

### Aquaman attaches the transmitter to the platform and slowly submerges with the Atlantian vessel.

### Secure warehouse

### Superman is lowering the tank into the warehouse Batman is at a table looking over plans with Lucius Fox.

### Superman approaches the table Fox stands up straight and extends his hand they shake.

### Fox

### How was that interview Mr. Kent?

### SM

### Well I guess you are good at keeping a secret. What are you working on?

### BM

### (Batman does not look up as he answers)

### Trying to develop this missile. We want it to deliver an EMP before it detonates. It should penetrate any vehicle weather the detonation does or not. Should also be effective even if there is a force field.

### SM

### So, what's the problem?

### BM

### We want to deliver the EMP directly into the circuitry of the target. Anything close is also effected.

### SM

### Pardon me for asking, but what were you developing something like that for?

### BM

### (Looking up)

### Something I have been keeping an eye on. Not important.

### SM

### What about that trust thing.

### BM

### I know, we have to deal with Darkseid now. I will tell you later.

### SM

### I have trouble with electricity. I am trying to figure out how to stop it when I need to.

### If anyone can figure this out it's J'onn, let him look at it.

### BM

### Good idea.

### (Beeping heard off screen)

### Lucius, the others will be here soon, you better go. If the Martian figures this out I will let you know.

### SM

### You have been a busy little bat. How far along is your deep space research project?

### BM

### (typing on the portable lap top)

### Far enough along to pick up those portals they are using.

### (looks up)

### Far enough along to know that comet eight months ago was a lot closer than anyone wants to admit. Nice save, by the way.

### (Superman grins and nods)

### SM

### Did you have a plan for that, you know, just in case.

### BM

### I was working on one with Lucius, called Project Javelin. I need to let you and the Martian look at that one too.

### SM

### I could run it by my friends at star labs, they did help me with my trip to Krypton.

### BM

### So they helped you disappear for five years.

### SM

### Yeah, so?

### BM

### Someone had to pick up your slack.

### SM

### Oh. Thanks.

### JJ comes up from the floor

### BM

### Any luck?

### JJ

### Yes I have given her a com link, she will be here soon.

### BM

### (touches the side of his cowl)

### Wonder Woman, do you copy this is Batman.

### OS WW"S voice

### Go ahead Batman

### BM

### I will send a pulse through the com link, just follow it to us.

### WW

### I'm on the way

### BM

### Flash, do you copy.

### F

### Yeah go ahead

### BM

### Where are you?

### F

### Just wrapping up a situation in Central City

### BM

### I'm sending a pulse through the com link, just follow it to...

### (Knock on the door BM turns startled)

### JJ

### He is fast.

### (Superman enters his code and opens the door)

### (Flash zips over to the table where Batman is standing)

### F

### What's up bats?

### (Batman squints, he is not completely sold about him)

### SM

### We need your help I will go into details when Wonder Woman gets here

Flash's eyes open wide

### F

### So she is coming? I have worked with her before, I picked up on a vibe, I think we made a connection.

### (Batman turns to Superman irritated, Superman gestures to him that it will be okay, they all look at Flash)

### F

### What?

### Wonder Woman arrives

### (Flash zips to her side)

### F

### Hey princess, long time no see, miss me?

### (Wonder Woman looks down at him pathetically)

### WW

### Hardly

### (She walks away to the table where JJ, Superman, and Batman are)

### (Flash zips in front of her again)

### F

### Well, I just thought that after the last time we worked together that we kind of... you know, made a connection.

### WW

### If you call helping you fight Giganta and a talking gorilla named Grod, making a connection, then your brain is not as fast as you are.

### (walking away then turning back)

### besides that was like what, two years ago? If there was a connection I would have called.

### (Wonder Woman pats Flash on the head and walks away)

### (Flash joins them at the table)

### F

### Okay big blue I suppose you will tell us what all the hub bub is about.

### Superman explains the events of the past few days as he is talking the scene switches to deep space where we find the Green Lantern racing to earth surrounded by a green glow. He looks ahead and is blinded by a bright flash of light and then disappears.

### Back to Gotham city as Superman finishes up.

### WW

### So Darkseid is coming here to kill Superman first and then take over the Earth.

### F

### What are we chopped liver.

### BM

### Make no mistake, Darkseid knows what everyone in this room capable of. If he falls then we are in deep trouble.

### WW

### (looking at Flash)

### As much as I hate to admit it he is right.

### SM

### So we need to present this to Col. Faraday and the President.

### (JJ and Batman are working on the laptop, JJis typing as Batman looks on)

### JJ

### That should solve your problem. I studied the circuitry on the tank and this configuration should work.

### (Batman nods then removes a disc from the laptop)

### BM

### (handing the disc to SM)

### When you do, have them retrofit this device to all of their missiles.

### (He then addresses the group)

### We're gonna need all the help we can get.

### (Batman touches the side of his cowl)

### Lucius are you there?

### OS Lucius voice

### Go ahead Mr. Wayne

### BM

### I'm sending the specs to you now. The Martian figured it out. How long before we are ready?

### OS Lucius voice

### 24 hours

### BM

### Can we expect the same from the government?

### OS Lucius's voice

### If the Martian helps them, yes.

### BM

### Okay I'll see you soon

### (Superman approaches)

### SM

### What? You are not coming with us? We should all go together.

### WW

### Superman is right.

### BM

### I'm still considered an outlaw. They have orders to arrest me on sight.

### (Holding up the disc)

### Besides, I have to prepare this weapon.

### SM

### (irritated)

### Yes, that weapon. A weapon that you have been working on before you suspected an attack. I asked you before Batman, why are you developing a weapon like that?

### (Superman gets in his face)

### It's time you told us the truth.

### (Batman looks over Superman's shoulder at J'onn)

### (JJ nods)

### BM

### I started to develop this weapon when I learned about Project Cadmus.

### SM

### What is that?

### (The others approach)

### BM

### It is some form of government operation with one purpose. To stand against us.

### (The others look surprised)

### WW

### Us? But we are here to help.

### SM

### What do you mean by, some form of government operation?

### BM

### Two years ago I was approached by a Professor Ray Palmer.

### F

### The nano-tech guy.

### BM

### Yes, He was hired as a consultant for Cadmus. What he saw disturbed him. So he came to me. Somehow he is able to sneak around that place and get me information from time to time.

### SM

### What place? Where?

### BM

### We don't know.

### (Superman turning to J'onn)

### Can't he find them? Telepathically I mean.

### JJ

### They are aware of me and what I can do. There building is shielded so I can not detect them.

### (SM turns to BM)

### BM

### He's right. He also told me that they are working on a fleet of super advanced robots whose only purpose is to defeat us.

### (holding up the disc)

### This weapon counters those robots.

### F

### So by giving them the technology to help us we are tipping our hand. They are going to know that we know.

### Cut to Green Lantern emerging from a white circular light in a palace. He looks at his arms as he is trying to figure out what happened. He then looks up and takes a defensive stance while making a fist with his right hand as his ring glows.

### The large figure standing before him speaks.

### At ease Earthling. I am not hear to harm you.

### GL

### What are you hear for? I mean what am I hear for? I mean somebody had better tell me what the hell is going on.

### O

### My name is Orion. This is the planet New Genesis. I have been directed by High Father to pass along some information. I detected you returning from Oa. I am sorry, but time is of the essence.

### GL

### Okay, what's up?

### O

### Your planet is under threat of invasion. The greatest evil the universe has ever known has set its sights on Earth. Darkseid, the ruler of the planet Apokolips intends to transform your planet into a likeness of his own.

### GL

### You seem to know a lot, why are you telling me? Why not use one of those things and go directly to Earth?

### O

### We have been under a peace treaty with Apokolips for years, we can not intervene. This meeting is a breach of that treaty. If Earth falls it will upset the balance. Darkseid feeds off of the suffering of others. Perhaps you and your Lantern Corps can stop him.

### GL

### One crisis one lantern. I do know some friends that can help. Now if you will show me the way out of here. I should be going.

### (Orion approaches. He hands GL a boom tube transmitter and another device)

### O

### That mother box will take you to your friends. This is a communication device explaining who we are and our involvement. It will also serve as a direct link to us if need be. God speed Lantern.

### GL

### Thanks Orion.

### (they shake hands and he turns and vanishes in a flash of light)

### As GL is traveling through the tube of light the mother box begins to beep,

### GL

### Let's see what this does.

### Back to the warehouse in Gotham.

### BM

### Not to mention that we may very well expend all of our ordinance. The only weapons that can stop those things.

### SM

### (looking away from the group who in turn to face him)

### They don't trust us. It's that simple. So we will have to earn it. That's why we are going. All of us.

### (The group turns to face Batman he is gone)

### (Superman shakes his head)

### BM's voice over the com link

### Sorry, I have to get back to the bat cave and get to work. Wrap up everything there. Do you trust the people at Star Labs Superman?

### SM

### Of course

### BM

### Take everything we need there. That will be our new headquarters for now. I'll be in touch.

### SM

### You not going isn't helping us at all. If anyone needs to be there it's you.

### BM

### Batman out.

### SM

### Well you heard him lets go.

### Wonder Woman and the others begin to grab all the things they need, computer etc.

### (Flash picks up the mother box)

### So this is what they are using? What does this thing-a-ma-jig do anyway? And why is it this button flashing?

### (He presses the button)

### SM

### Flash, don't!

### A white circle of light appears Superman places himself in front of the others. They are ready.

### (The Green Lantern appears)

### It's called a mother box.

### F

### GL! Where have you been?

### GL

### Getting filled in on what's about to happen. We need to get to the White house now.

### WW

### Were on the way.

### SM

### I'll get this stuff to Star Labs and meet you there. Um, does anybody have a phone? (asks awkwardly)

### (Flash removes one from under his belt)

### Just no 1-900 numbers big guy.

### Superman shakes his head and dials a number. He asks Flash for the number, enters it and hangs up.

### Less than a minute later the phone rings to a ring tone of superfreak by Rick James. Wonder Woman rolls her eyes. Superman grins as he answers.

### SM

### Colonel Faraday this is Superman. We need to meet with the President and the Joint Chiefs in thirty minutes.

### Colonel Faraday is walking through the halls of the Pentagon he stops when Superman makes his request.

### CF

### What do you mean "we"? I can't call a meeting on that short of a notice. I have to go through General Eiling then he has to go through Gen Hardcastle. What is going on?

### SM

### Trust me Colonel we need to meet now.

### CF

### This had better be good.

### SM

### To the contrary sir, this is very bad.

### Superman hangs up and crushes Flash's phone

### F

### What the hell man, I'm expecting a call.

### SM

### You are going to be too busy, besides after what we just heard about this Cadmus business I don't want them finding this warehouse.

### Superman turns to address the group

### SM

### I will contact the President directly when I get to Star Labs. You will all have permission to gather on the White House lawn. Meet you there in thirty minutes. J'onn you come with me, help explain all this.

### Superman then gathers the materials in a duffle and takes off crashing through the roof with J'onn behind him. Green Lantern and Wonder Woman fly through the same hole.

### F

### (looking up at the hole shaking his head calmly walks to the door mumbles)

### Why is this so hard?

### Calmly open the door and looks back up at the hole in the roof.

### He speeds out through the door as a crimson blur streaks through the streets.

### Washington DC

### Flash enters a breakfast diner and sits at the counter. The waitress approaches, pad and pen in hand, not looking up.

### What can I get for you honey?

### F

### I'll have twenty eggs over medium and 20 pancakes. I hate to be rude but I'm kind of in a hurry.

### The waitress stops writing and looks up, shocked.

### F

### Make sure they are over medium.

### He then opens the cake stand and quickly eats all of the Danish

### F

### (with a mouth full of food)

### Put those on the bill to.

### He then zips into the bathroom.

### Star Labs

### Professor Emil Hamilton arrives for work early as he enters his office he notices that the lights are on in the communication center. He quickly walks into the room and finds Superman at a terminal with J'onn. He cautiously approaches not taking his eyes off J'onn.

### PH

### Superman, how did you...?

### SM

### Good morning professor, sorry I had to let myself in. Oh, this is my friend J'onn J'onnz.

### J'onn extends his hand with no emotion on his face. Hamilton cautiously shakes.

### PH

### This isn't going to be a normal day. Is it?

### SM

### Nope, not today. I'm going to call the president. J'onn could you get the professor up to speed.

### J'onn begins to speak as Superman picks up a nearby phone.

### Oval office, where the President, Gen. Hardcastle, and Col Faraday and staff members are preparing for the meeting.

### (A staff member approaches with a phone.)

### Mr. President, it's for you. It's him.

### P

### Superman, what is all of this about?

### SM

### We will explain when we get there. I'm going to need your permission to land at the White House with my friends.

### P

### Are you nuts? What is going on?

### SM

### Trust me sir. If this wasn't of the most urgent nature I would not be calling.

### P

### Okay Superman. Permission granted.

### (hangs up)

### General we have some visitors coming they will be gathering on the White House lawn. Notify the military.

### GH

### But sir?!

### P

### Just do it General!

### GH

### Yes sir.

### Superman, Green Lantern, JJ, and Wonder Woman all land on the White house lawn.

### GL

### Where's Flash?

### SM

### Hard to believe that he can be late.

### Flash appears in a rush of air holding a foam cup and a straw, after he sips air through the straw he lets out a loud belch.

### F

### Sorry, I had to get a bite to eat.

### The team looks at each other and shakes their heads. Wonder Woman glares at him

### F

### What? I have a very high metabolism. Takes a lot of gas to run a Cadillac baby.

### They all turn to see the President approach, flanked by Generals and staff.

### Superman standing in the middle extends his hand and the greet each other. Superman makes all of the introductions. Cut to a reporter outside the gate of the White House.

### This is Snapper Carr reporting live from the White House where a historic meeting has just taken place. Superman, Wonder Woman, The Green Lantern, the Flash, and an unidentified.... Green man just met the President and the Joint Chiefs on the White House lawn. Now we have no idea what this meeting is about but we have received word that there will be a press conference sometime this afternoon.

### Oval office

### Colonel Faraday

### Mr. President, I have been dealing with Superman for a while now if he says there is a threat then there is one.

### President

### I need proof.

### GL

### Allow me

### (he holds up the communicator that was given to him by Orion he places it on the desk and an image of Orion's head appears. He explains the history with New Genesis and Apokolips. He explains that they are under a treaty of peace but felt compelled to intervene. He also explains that this an interactive device and can answer questions.

### Gen Hardcastle

### Why don't we use those mother boxes to deliver a couple dozen nukes?

### The communicator hesitates slightly

### "Darkseid's technology is far more advanced than yours. You will simply be giving him nuclear bombs that he will use at his leisure. I implore you to not use any nuclear technology against him, your people will suffer."

### President

### Okay, what do we do?

### SM

### (hands General Hardcastle the disc)

### Use this device with all of your air to air and surface to air missiles.

### GH

### What is it?

### SM

### It's a device that Batman was devol.....

### Gen Eiling

### Oh no, no, no! That man is a fugitive. You have broken the law by colluding with him. You see Mr. President this is why we can't trust these "super friends".

### SM

### Mr. President, it was Batman that discovered the plot. If it were not for he and J'onn then we would be fighting a losing battle tomorrow. Because of him we have a chance to plan, we have a chance to win.

### President

### The general is right son, he is a criminal. And who is this? J'onn did you say? What's his story?

### SM

### (hesitates with an awkward look)

### Um, he's from Mars.

### President

### Oh, well, Mars. That makes perfect sense.

### SM

### (agitated)

### Mr. President, with respect, he nearly died trying to get word to Aquaman.

### Gen Hardcastle  
What?!? That guy is a myth. Mr. President, please. This is outrageous. The next thing they are going to say is that Atlantis is real.

### They all look at one another and shrug.

### President

### Oh, come on!

### SM

### It's very real sir. Darkseid planned to attack there. He was planning to use the cover of that place tap the Earth's core. Had he succeeded then Earth as we know it would be changed forever. Batman warned him in time.

### President

### I'm sorry but I need more proof than your word, this is so outrageous.

### GL

### We are wasting time.

### WW

### Lantern's right. We need to be getting ready.

### SM

### Wait! Mr. President if you will excuse me.

### Superman hurries to the door and takes off, quickly breaking the sound barrier as he speeds toward Gotham.

### The President, his staff and the members of the league stand in the oval office, awkwardly looking at each other.

### Gen Eiling and the Flash lock eyes. Flash then streaks across the room and stops behind the General.

### F

### (Taps the general on the shoulder)

### Can I help you?

### President

### Where did he go?

### Gen Hardcastle

### (looking out of the window)

### Holy shit, what the hell is that?

### There is a loud boom and the room shakes as Superman drops the hover tank on the lawn.

### He reenters the oval office.

### SM

### There is your proof. Anytime now the skies will be filled with thousands of these things.

### The President is still in shock, it takes him a second.

### President

### What do we do?

### WW

### The first thing we need to do is evacuate the entire city of Metropolis.

### GL

### She's right. If they are coming for Superman then that's where they will attack first.

### President

### (He has regained his composure and his commands are sharp)

### General Hardcastle, take us to defcon two. Activate the National Guard. Alert all branches we are evacuating Metropolis and all surrounding areas. And get everyone started on this device. Other than the evacuation, this is priority one.

### GH

### Yes Sir.

### General Eiling leaves the oval office and opens his cell phone.

### Waller? This Eiling, you're not going to believe this.

### SM

### Mr. President, professor Hamilton at Star Labs has already started on that device.

### President

### Colonel Faraday, you are the official military liaison for this... group, stay with them as best you can.

### SM

### (Finger to his ear)

### Okay professor I read you.

### The professor is ready at the lab. Batman just delivered the components needed. Sounds like he had this planned from the start. J'onn you and Flash go there now.

### (approaches J'onn)

### J'onn can you implant the assembly procedures in Flash's mind so he can put them together?

### JJ

### Of course.

### SM

### Good, go now

### F

### I'm on it.

### SM

### Gen Hardcastle, we will assemble the device there and Flash will distribute them, remember we will need to get them around the world.

### GH

### Will do.

### A staff member approaches

### Mr. President, we ran a scenario last month that called for the evacuation of Metropolis. It took three days. There aren't enough bridges.

### GL

### I can take care of that.

### WW

### I'll help.

### The league goes into action, Superman and J'onn fly away to Star Labs. The military quickly ascends on Metropolis. The word is given as the president addresses the nation. While he is giving his speech you see Flash, his hands a blur as he assembles the components. J'onn and Superman coordinate with Faraday organizing the military. Superman flies to London, Peking, Berlin, and other capitals around the world delivering the news. Flash fills a container and then speeds away to destinations around the world. Wonder Woman is seen carrying busses of people over the city to safety. Green Lantern uses his ring to create bridges so the evacuation can go faster.

### President's speech

### Ladies and gentlemen the past few hours have seen some extraordinary activity around the world. It has been brought to our attention that our planet Earth is under threat of invasion. Our military along with forces around the world are mobilizing to repel this threat. We also have the help of some of those who have been called into question in the past few months. Make no mistake, these unique individuals are here to help. Their mission today is to save humanity, without them our efforts would have been near impossible. I ask, especially in the city of Metropolis that you assist them in any way you can. And should we win the day these super heroes, these friends of humanity will no longer be perceived in a negative light, but in a bright light of hope for all mankind.

### Superman is flying over the city when he hears a familiar voice coming from the Daily Planet building.

### SM

### (crashes through a window)

### Lois. Why are you still here? Jimmy did she put you up to this?

### LL

### Relax, he is here because he wants to be. The biggest story ever and I have a ring side seat? I'm not going anywhere.

### SM

### Lois, don't do this, the attack could come at any minute. I can not protect you.

### LL

### No one is asking you to. I can take care of my self. Besides I don't know where Clark is, he leaves for the press conference and then the Wayne interview, then disappears.

### SM

### He is fine, he's covering this from Gotham City.

### LL

### Figures, farthest from the danger, as usual.

### SM

### So let's go.

### LL

### I said I'm not leaving.

### SM

### I'm not going to argue about this.

### Superman swoops over and takes Lois under one arm and Jimmy Olsen under the other and flies out of the window, Lois screaming the whole time.

### LL

### Put me down! Let me go!

### SM

### I'm taking you to Star Labs, believe me if you want a story, there is one there.

### LL

### What do you mean?

### SM

### How would you like to interview a Martian?

### LL

### Another alien, no big deal.

### Superman grins as he continues toward Star Labs

### Batman on the com link

### Superman, how are we doing?

### SM

### We are on schedule. The city should be evacuated in about ten hours Batman.

### LL

### Batman, now there is a story.

### BM on com link

### I should be ready soon. See you at Star Labs.

### SM

### Roger, out.

### Battle scene

### The League is atop the Daily Planet. Batman's jet is parked. The others stand quietly as Flash sits on a crate downing cheeseburgers.

### Batman's transmitter starts to beep like crazy as it struggles to keep up with the spikes that flood its circuits.

### BM

### It's time General. They will be here in five minutes.

### GH

### Copy that Batman.

### (over the radio)

### Five minutes men!

### The call goes out around the world as armies amass for the impending threat.

### Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, J'onn all stand on top of the Daily Planet building. Looking toward the sky. The silence is broken by the Flash chewing loudly sitting behind a pile of empty wrappers. WW looks at him harshly and rolls her eyes.

### WW smirks and Flash stands beside her as they mentally prepare themselves for the coming battle.

### BM

### This is it, we draw the line here. Whatever happens, well,..... you know.

### F

### Not exactly Nute Rockne.

### Flash finally manages to get a grin from Batman, he approaches and they shake hands.

### BM

### Good luck.

### F

### You too.

### Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and JJ take off spreading out over the city. Flash speeds away back to Star Labs to monitor communications.

### Batman and Superman are left. They stand quietly sizing one another up.

### BM

### Well, I hope this works.

### SM

### Yeah.

### BM

### For a couple of loners, I think we picked a pretty good team. Good luck Clark

### They shake hands

### SM

### You to Bruce.

### Superman flies away and Batman starts his jet. It hovers, turns and flies to meet the approaching military aircraft.

### BM

### (over the radio)

### Remember General let us do our work in the sky first before you use the surface batteries. We don't want to shoot down our own guys.

### GH

### (over the radio)

### I hope this works, we sure are putting our all of our eggs in one basket. I feel that we have ignored the rest of the country.

### BM

### Well, we have. The military should hold them off, besides there are more than seven of us out there.

### GH

### Great.

### Batman grins as he pulls in front of the other military jets.

### Pilot

### (over the radio)

### Damn, look at all those missiles. How does he get off the ground with all that stuff.

### BM

### They have a shorter range, I like to get in close. Remember whatever ships you see are your targets. Do not fire into the boom tubes I'm not sure what effect they will have on our missiles.

### Pilot

### (over the radio)

### Everybody copy that?

### The horizon over Metropolis lights up as hundreds of bright circles appear in the sky.

### Superman speeds to the first one he sees and hovers in front of it. His eyes turn red as he delivers a blast from his heat vision into the boom tube. You hear screams and explosions from inside the tube.

### Darkseid watches as his advance troops enter the boom tubes on Apokolips. One lights up with fire and smoke as pieces of ships and bodies explode back through the hole. Some debris land at his feet.

### DS

### The Kryptonian. Impressive.

### Then another does the same, followed by three more.

### DS

### Desaad, prepare my ship. I'll deal with him.

### (General Hardcastle is watching through his binoculars)

### Jesus, I hope I never piss that guy off.

### The parademons appear as well as the tanks and some other ships that no one has seen before. Batman starts firing on the tanks with his missiles as well as the fighter jets.

### Radio traffic heard from the Bat jet

### Good tone fox 1, good tone fox two.

### BM

### (over the com link)

### J'onn! See if you can get a peak inside on of those big ones.

### J'onn stops in front of one as it lumbers towards him. He becomes transparent and then disappears into the ship. He emerges from the back and becomes solid, he is also holding a circuit board with wires hanging out of it. The ship then sputters and begins a rapid decent towards the ground, crashing outside the city.

### JJ

### They are carrying some type of ground assault vehicles. The ships circuits are the same so our missiles will work.

### BM

### General our missiles will work on the larger ships.

### GH

### Copy that Batman. Ground batteries get ready to fire. Major get that information out.

### As the larger lower ships approach the ground batteries fire taking out dozens of ships. Green Lantern takes out several of parademons with a giant fist. A tank approaches and he uses his ring to capture one and smash it through the tank, breaking it in half. Wonder Woman was in front of a boom tube that contained all parademons. They fire their lasers that she deflects into other parademons killing them. She then lassos one and spins fiercely using its body to take out other approaching parademons. JJ punches some and uses his earlier trick to take out other ships. A tank approaches from behind and one from the front. He phases out as the beams pass through him striking each other. Batman continues to zip through the waves of parademons and take out ships with his missiles. His are slightly modified, he can detonate then manually and take out more than one with the EMP pulse.

### GH

### We're getting reports of a very large craft approaching the main island of Hawaii.

### SM

### Flash, check it out.

### Flash grabs the camera and speeds away at an incredible speed. You see a red streak racing across the country then a white wake as he speeds across the water. He returns in a few minutes. Removes the chip and places it in the terminal.

### GH

### We are getting the same reports over Italy, Indonesia and Japan.

### Superman is flying through ships at supersonic speed.

### SM

### Flash!

### F

### I'm on it.

### He speeds away and circumnavigates the globe. Stopping briefly at Mt. Etna, M. Fuji, and a volcanic island near Indonesia.

### He returns soon after as the battle rages on, he skids to a stop beside professor Hamilton

### F

### Yep, they are all the same.

### GL

### (over the com link)

### Those are volcanoes.

### BM

### I'll bet those are drilling machines.

### GL

### (as he slices a ship in half with his ring)

### Yep, now we know his plan.

### SM

### Well those are our first priority. Give the word General take them out.

### GH

### Bad news Superman, an air group already tried over Japan, our missiles had no effect. (explosions nearby) I repeat, no effect.

### BM

### Well we better think of something fast.

### Superman is swarmed by a mass of parademons, he continues to swirl upward carrying the swarm into a cloud. They are followed by three tanks.

### BM

### Hang on Superman I'm on the way.

### The cloud lights up in different areas in orange explosions, it then glows bright red and explodes as debris flies out of it in all directions.

### Superman shoots out of the cloud.

### BM

### Never mind.

### SM

### J'onn you had better get to the lab and try to find a weakness.

### JJ

### I'm on the way.

### GH

### That might not be a good idea, we are getting pummeled over here we are evacuating all non essential personnel.

### SM

### GL, did you get that? You better get over there.

### GL

### Roger

### Lantern flies backwards and takes out several parademons with short bursts from his ring. He and J'onn arrive to find the lab being defended by troops and the Flash streaking around the building taking out parademons. He stops and starts to rotate his arms creating two tornados that blow several parademons and ships out to sea. On the grounds of Star labs a twin rotor

### Helicopter is preparing to take off.

### Soldier

### This is the last of the batteries sir! General Hardcastle wants this one atop the Daily Planet!

### Lois

### (hiding behind a crate w/ Jimmy Olsen)

### Come on Jimmy that's our ride.

### Amidst the confusion they manage to sneak on board the chopper.

### GL and J'onn arrive and with the help of Flash and the soldiers they manage to fend off the attackers.

### GL

### Star Labs secure.

### WW

### It is starting to let up, could it be over?

### BM

### I doubt it, that was too easy.

### SM

### I think Batman is right, but if it is we need to take care of those drilling machines.

### All of a sudden the sky lights up with a new series of circles, in the middle of the smaller ships is an enormous mother ship. Inside the ship Darkseid, flanked by Desaad and Kalibak, commands his troops

### DS

### General Steppenwolf, destroy this city and bring me the Kryptonian, alive.

### Gen S

### Mantis go with the Furies and dispose of the Kryptonian's friends. Devilance, you heard your master, alive.

### Kalibak

### But father, I can defeat this man of steel.

### (Darkseid looks at him almost pathetically)

### DS

### Then go my son.

### They all ascend from the mother ship in a beam of light.

### WW

### Looks like the varsity team is here. We're going to need everyone up here now.

### The invaders stand shoulder to shoulder in the deserted street. Wonder Woman lands first, followed by Superman. Flash streaks up followed by the landings of GL, JJ, and Batman repels down last. Darkseid watches from above.

### DS

### Instruct your troops not to interfere, I like watching a good fight.

### GS

### As you wish sir.

### There is a brief moment, the two sides size one another up.

### BM

### This is wasting our time. The drilling machines should be our first priority.

### SM

### Then let's make this quick.

### F

### Somebody say quick? I'll take the hottie in the black spandex.

### GL

### Flash wait!

### Flash ignores the request, he streaks forward to Lashina. She grins as she uses her electrified whips and times the Flash's approach perfectly. He yells as she connects and sends Flash through a store front window. Wonder Woman rolls her eyes before charging with her teammates. Devilance hits Superman with a blast from his lance sending him to his knees, Kalibak approaches and delivers a right upper cut sending superman flying backwards into a car nearly splitting it in half. Wonder Woman is met by a charging Stompa, she side steps her and tosses her aside, Knockout catches WW with a punch that flattens her on her back, Stompa recovers and comes down on WW with both feet driving her through the street. GL engages Mantis who can take GL's blasts and absorb them, he fires back but GL manages to shield himself from his own power.

### Batman evades Lashina's whips as he uses his rope gun to climb the side of a building, she uses her whips to climb behind him. He stops on a ledge and turns, Lashina tackles him through a window. Devilance and Kalibak continue their assault on Superman. JJ flies toward Kalibak who swings wildly. JJ phases into the street, Kalibak looks around JJ rises behind him and sends him flying with a thunderous right hand. You see flashes of electricity from the window and Batman yelling with each blow, Flash streaks up the stairs and circles Lashina, spinning her around, she nearly passes out when Flash stops. Batman has slipped on what are in the shape of brass knuckles, they spark like tasers.

### F

### What will they do?

### BM

### We're about to find out.

### You hear a zap and Lashina flies through a window and lands on a car crushing it.

### Knockout punches JJ in the back of the head dropping him beside Superman. She stands with Devilance and Kalibak and the street begins to quake, they are all sent flying back after being hit by large chunks of asphalt as WW pushes Stompa up through the street flying away and drives her into the ground. WW stands over Stompa and is fallen by a blast a blast from Steppenwolf's jet cycle. Superman recovers and strikes Devilance with several blows, the last one sends him flying down the street, he bounces off of the corner of a building, taking out a large chunk.

### All the while Lois and Jimmy are watching from the roof of the Daily Planet.

### Jimmy

### (Taking pictures)

### Wow, Superman just clobbered the big one.

### WW stands only to be slammed by a charging Stompa, WW is sent flying to the shores landing in the shallow water. Stompa lands in front of her, she raises her foot over WW's head and is leveled before she can connect. She turns to see Aquaman standing behind her.

### Stompa

### (stands rubbing the back of her head)

### Where did you come from?!

### AM

### Let me show you.

### Aquaman grabs her in a full nelson and leaps into the water, he dives deep and spins over and over, a moment later he drags up the unconscious body and drops it on the shore.

### WW

### Let me guess, you're Aquam... I mean Arthur.

### I'm Dinah.

### They shake hands.

### WW

### Need a lift.

### Aquaman looks confused

### Ooookay.

### She picks him up under his arms and flies back to the city.

### GL is still struggling with Mantis

### BM

### I'll take this one, they are a few blocks over but I think they need some help. Go!

### Mantis

### What do you have to offer little man.

### Batman removes his knuckles, he knows that they will only be absorbed by Mantis.

### Mantis charges and misses wildly, Batman catches him off guard and flattens him with a straight kick to the side of the face.

### BM

### Absorb that.

### Mantis slowly rises. Batman looks upward as he stands up, he is several inches taller than Batman.

### When WW and AM arrive they pass GL flying through the air and ends up crashing on the roof of a building. They land to find Lashina swinging wildly at Flash as he streaks around her. Gen Stepp flies by and blasts the street, Flash trips on the hole and lands several blocks away. WW lands w/ AM and they asses the situation

### AM

### The big one with the lance is definitely a job for Superman, so lets get down there and even up the odds.

### As Superman levels Kalibak, Devilance blasts him in the back and drops him, he raises his lance and as he is twisting it around to rotate the head downward there is a brief moment where he releases the staff. Flash streaks by and takes it away from him, his blur then disappears several blocks away. From an airel view you see the blur run to the other side of the city then return to stand in front of a still bewildered Devilance.

### F

### Good luck finding that thing chief.

### He then streaks away

### Lashina and Knockout square of with WW as she deflects her whips with her bracelets. Flash starts to run circles under Stepp's cycle, it slows as the tornado engulfs it and it starts to spin, Flash stops and when Stepp stops spinning JJ knocks him off of him cycle with a punch as he flies by. GL recovers to see Stompa starting to come around as she is standing GL flies over and flattens her with a giant green boot.

### GL

### Stay down bitch!

### Superman can now face the powerful Devilance who now has no help or lance, it isn't much of a fair fight, Superman slams him through a building and continues the beating as he flies. Devilance doesn't have much of a chance. Darkseid watches as his best is driven through building after building. WW continues to hold off Lashina as Knockout sneaks behind a car for a sucker punch. As she is about to strike she is driven through a wall by a large green fist. WW uses the distraction to catch Lashina with an uppercut as she is flying through the air Flash speeds up and crashes her through a store front window.

### F

### Now we're even.

### WW and GL walk up and stand beside Flash as they look at Lashina, who is clearly out of the fight.

### F

### Too bad she's kinda cute.

### WW

### Do you ever stop?

### F

### What? She is.

### Kalibak and Aquaman continue to fight, after Kalibak misses Aquaman holds him in an arm bar sending Kalibak to his knees. He raises his head in agony in an attempt to stand. AM releases and crushes Kalibak to the street with a fight-ending right cross. JJ flies in and drops the body of Steppenwolf beside Kalibak. GL lowers Lashina and Knockout in a green ball and WW drops Stompa in a heap.

### GL

### We're one short.

### Superman hovering uses his hearing and hears a commotion down the street. He quickly flies away and finds Batman in a building still fighting with Mantis, there is blood coming from the corners of his mouth and nose but he is holding his own. Mantis doesn't look much better. Batman catches Mantis with a series of punches. But after all of that Mantis rises again. He never knows what hits him as Superman flies into him and drops him with a flying punch.

### BM

### I had him right where I wanted him.

### SM

### Are you okay.

### (He scans him w/ his x-ray vision)

### BM

### I'm fine

### SM

### You have three cracked ribs and.....

### BM

### I said I'm fine.

### (Batman touches the side of his cowl)

### Where are we General?

### GH

### We're ready with what we have left.

### BM

### I have to get back in the air. Get ready for the final assault.

### SM

### Are you sure you're okay?

### BM

### (firing his rope gun and ascending upward)

### Just be ready!

### Batman goes to the top of the Daily planet to get his jet. The soldiers have set up the batteries and have left. He approaches his craft and hears a camera clicking, he ducks behind a wall.

### JO

### (whispering)

### Where did he go?

### LL

### (whispering)

### I don't know.

### BM

### (now behind them)

### You shouldn't be here,

### Lois and Jimmy turned startled

### BM

### It's not over.

### LL

### (slowly approaching BM)

### But I saw you guys win.

### BM

### That was the first wave, you need to leave now.

### LL

### Listen pal, superman already tried, so you think your luck will be any better?

### BM hears a beeping as his canopy opens the engines start to hum.

### BM

### I don't have time for this.

### LL

### Go ahead we'll be okay.

### BM

### Go ahead, Lucius. This is a secure line. Any luck on those drills?

### (LF's voice on the radio)

### No but I think Professor Hamilton's people have constructed some bombs that may work.

### BM

### What's the bad news?

### LF

### The size and the inability to deliver them in time. Military communications are saying that they have started drilling. They are trying to figure a way to deliver them.

### (another beep)

### BM answers and apprises Professor Palmer of the situation

### BM

### Professor Palmer says he has something that will work. I'm on my way to get him.

### Back at the center of the city the ships approach that have been hovering over the edge of the city.

### Darkseid looks down at his defeated warriors.

### DS

### Looks like I'll have to do this myself. Desaad, attack with everything we have.

### Darkseid lowers on a ray of light as the sun begins to set

### BM

### Superman did you copy that?

### SM

### Yeah we copy.

### BM

### Flash meet me at Star Labs in ten minutes.

### Flash's voice over the radio

### I'm already there.

### The rest of the league looks upward as Darkseid approaches.

### Aquaman sees the approaching ships. He speaks into an Atlantean communicator.

### AM

### General Curry, you have your orders.

### (Looks at the league)

### AM

### That should buy us some time.

### SM

### J'onn! GL! Do what you can in the air. We'll take this guy.

### GL and JJ fly off and engage the invaders. The sky fills with the remaining missiles.

### Darkseid lands in front of WW, SM, and AM

### DS

### Unlikely.

### WW strikes first, she lands a solid punch, DS steps back slightly, he backhands WW across the street. AM strikes as does SM, he catches them both by the throat. He casually tosses AM away and holds SM to his face.

### DS

### My prize, this world rises and falls with you Kryptonian. Say good bye to another planet.

### He releases SM as he fires the beams from his eyes, striking SM in the chest. SM yells in pain as the beam rips into him driving him backwards into the wall of a building. The beam continues as DS grins. He stops thinking the job is done but SM is still there smoldering on his knees.

### DS

### Impressive, most impressive. I look forward to doing this the hard way.

### WW recovers and flies into DS with both fists knocking him down. AM picks up a car and drives it into him, partially imprinting him into the asphalt. He slaps the car away and mixes it up w/ AM his punches have little effect and he quickly dispatches him into a nearby building he turns to SM.

### DS

### Now to finish this.

### WW lassos him and manages to get him off his feet as she spins in mid air gaining momentum. She releases him into a building that is already unstable from the earlier battle. The building groans and collapses on top of DS.

### WW turns to help SM to his feet, he is still wobbly from the Omega beam. As he gets to his feet an explosion of debris takes WW off her feet and she disappears in a pile of rubble. DS emerges from the rubble. SM stands before him cape tattered shirt ripped. SM w/ the speed of Flash flies into him as they speed to the northern part of town. WW and AM stagger to their feet bleeding from the beating DS gave them. The punches from the fight btwn SM and DS echo like thunder as distant building collapse. In the skies JJ and GL do their best to hold off the invaders but the numbers are not on there side. They begin to falter as more and more parademons strike them from all sides. The Atlantien ships that surfaced have taken out as many of DS's ships that they could reach. The soldiers w/ swords and drawn have engaged the parademons on foot in the streets of the city.

### Star Labs

### BM lands w/ Prof. Palmer. Dr Hamilton and his staff, along w a few military scientists have constructed four bombs that are about the size of a television. BM and Palmer walk in, BM still bloody from battle and Palmer carrying a brief case.

### PH

### Here are the bombs but we have no way to deliver them they are just too heavy.

### (He points to a photo of one of the drilling machines)

### If we can place it here it will shut down the whole thing.

### PP

### I think I can do something about the size.

### (He opens his brief case and there are four oval shaped devices. He attaches one to the bombs and turns a dial. They step back as it shrinks to the size of a rubik's cube.)

### PP

### Just turn this dial in the opposite direction and it goes back to it's original size.

### (He attaches the rest of the devices and BM puts them separate containers on a spare utility belt. He then hands the belt to Flash who secures it around his waist)

### BM

### That should hold up to the speed that you will be traveling.

### F

### (grins)

### Be back in a flash

### (streaks away then right back)

### Okay that was bad.

### Flash streaks away as he did the last time, the red blur cutting across the country and then the boom when he breaks the sound barrier. Across the oceans.

### BM returns to his jet Lucius is calling.

### BM

### Go ahead Lucius.

### LF

### I have hacked into the geological survey stations monitoring the activity around the volcanoes where those machines are drilling. They are all drilling at the same rate. I have also detected a signal from each machine to that large ship over Metropolis.

### BM

### Okay. I'm sure you are getting ready to give me some bad news.

### LF

### The bombs have to be triggered simultaneously. Think about it as releasing pressure. You have to do it evenly. And with that signal when the first one shuts down they will know it.

### BM

### Right. Thanks.

### (switches over)

### Professor Hamilton, how precise are the timers on the bombs?

### PF

### (voice)

### We assembled them in a hurry but they should be accurate down to the second.

### BM

### Flash come in.

### F

### (voice)

### Go ahead.

### You have to set the timers so the bombs will detonate at the same time.

### F

### (voice)

### And I thought this was going to be hard.

### BM flies back into the fray, SM and DS's battle thunders on as AM and WW are now encircled by parademons at an intersection, breathing heavy from their battle. BM lands and repels down into the enclosing circle he slips on his knuckles and switches them on. JJ and GL land in the circle as well. Some of DS's elite forces have recovered as well. Devilance, Kalibak, and Stompa are closing in with the parademons. The league minus SM and F form a circle back to back.

### Flash speeds to each location moving so fast that he is not detected by the few guarding troops, they may feel a rush of air and look around, but see nothing.

### Metropolis

### The league readies for the rush when all of a sudden the thunderous fight in the distance stops. They glance at each other and then hear the distant footsteps grow closer. The fight btwn SM and DS caused a thick cloud of dust, as it clears they see to their horror DS holding SM over his head bloody and beaten. The parademons part as DS approaches the rest of the league.

### Indonesia

### Flash sets the last bomb with little time to spare. As he is running across the water the machine detonates in the background.

### Metropolis

### DS tosses the body of SM at the leagues feet.

### Desaad

### (voice)

### Lord Darkseid the drills have been destroyed.

### DS

### (speaking into a communicator on his wrist)

### What!

### Desaad

### (Inside the ship looking at a monitor)

### That is not all sir I am picking up an approaching ship.

### The sky flashes and you see a white circle forming, the sillouette of a large figure approaches as it lowers from the light.

### GL

### He's with us. I think.

### Orion hovers lower until he is face to face with DS

### DS

### Hello my son.

### O

### Let's dispense with the pleasantries Darkseid. High Father has decreed that this planet is now protected under the treaty of New Genesis. Go home or feel the brunt of our forces against your depleted reserves. Leave this planet and never return.

### DS pauses and surveys his surroundings. The league helps SM to his feet as Flash rejoins them, a rush of air and he appears.

### F

### What'd I miss?

### DS

### Very well. I will not squabble over this tiny blip in the universe. I have been watching them for quite some time. They will destroy themselves, it's in there nature.

### (He takes in a deep breath)

### So much pain and fear, I can feel it rushing through my blood.

### As Aquaman's troops stand down and return to their ships, the invaders gather their forces and prepare to travel back to Apokolips.

### BM

### (turns to SM)

### Are you okay?

### SM nods his strength is returning.

### BM

### I have to check on some people. I'll be back.

### BM scales the building to his jet and hovers as he turns to the Daily Planet.

### DS is at the opening of his ship, the league is now on top of a nearby building. They watch in silence as the invaders start to return into the boom tubes back to Apokolips.

### Orion finishes talking to GL and the rest of the league.

### SM approaches, they shake hands,

### SM

### Thank you.

### O

### I was hoping to meet you one day, I've heard a lot about you. You now know how to reach us, don't hesitate if you need to.

### SM

### I will

### Orion gets on his vessel and hovers, the boom tube opens.

### O

### Oh, and you're welcome.

### He turns and flies into the tube it closes behind him.

### DS stands on a platform of the ship

### DS

### I am the creator and destroyer of worlds. You are merely ants and I am a God. Never forget how quickly I can destroy your new world Kryptonian.

### DS then scans the horizon and sees the large globe atop the daily planet. His eyes glow bright red as he fires at the globe destroying it. It explodes right in front of BM's jet he swerves to miss some debris. He looks on in horror.

### The door closes behind DS and his ship disappears into the boom tube, the last one to close in the sky. As the debris crashes down on top of the planet building SM hears a scream, a familiar scream. Struggling to hear he removes his com link.

### BM circles in the jet as SM approaches. He knows what is about to happen.

### BM

### WW, we need everyone back to Star Labs now.

### BM flies away as SM slings the debris aside looking for Lois and Jimmy.

### In dimly lit room at an undisclosed location several shadowy figures sit around a table monitoring the events of the day.

### Amanda Waller, Director of Cadmus

### Gen Eiling what is your assessment, from a military standpoint?

### GE

### We would not stand a chance, especially since they have developed the technology to counter our only weapon against them. I have said from day one that this place is wide open.(slams his fist on the table) How did this happen? We spent more money than we could hide developing those robots and now they are worthless!

### LL

### (Luthor leaning forward into the light)

### Calm down General. If money is your concern then I will simply write a check. As far as who the leak is, there is only one empty seat at the table.

### AW

### Palmer, I'll have him picked up immediately.

### LL

### Why, he is with them now. You want to take them on? They know who we are now.

### GE

### And we know who they are too.

### AW

### That's right. And what they are capable of. But they don't have any idea of our capabilities. We will have to expedite all of our secondary initiatives.

### LL

### Agreed.

### BM lands on a nearby building and fires his cable to help Superman. He knows that it is hopeless, there is no way that anyone could have survived.

### SM

### Found 'em!

### BM hurries over, SM pulls Lois from the debris, her body is limp.

### SM

### Lois. Lois.

### He scans her body with his x-ray vision. He does not like what she sees.

### BM

### She covered Jimmy. He is alive but barely. Superman you have to get him out of here! Superman!

### SM stands with his back to BM holding Lois filled with agony.

### BM

### Superman.

### CLARK!

### SM turns there is no emotion in his face.

### BM

### (on the com link)

### Flash. I need you at the top of the Daily Planet now.

### A few seconds later Flash arrives. BM places the nearly lifeless body of Jimmy Olsen in his arms.

### BM

### Get him to the army field hospital now. Then meet back at the lab.

### Flash does not say a word as he evaporates into a blur, streaking down the side of the building.

### BM turns to SM he is now on his knees weeping. BM approaches from behind and places his hand on his shoulder.

### BM

### I'm sorry Clark but we have to save the ones that we can. And there are still more to save.

### SM does not respond. BM returns to his jet. SM flies away with Lois. As BM flies away. He returns to Star Labs where the league awaits he and SM's return.

### BM walks in.

### F

### I think we got the kid to the doc in time.

### BM

### That's good news.

### WW

### Batman, what is going on?

### BM

### That final blast from Darkseid killed Lois Lane. Lantern do you still have that mother box?

### (Gl removes it from his belt)

### Give it to me. (He puts into a compartment in his utility belt and removes the one from the warehouse.

### he tosses it to Flash)

### What ever happens, do not let SM get this.

### WW

### By the gods. Do you think he would go there.

### AM

### I would.

### JJ

### Then let's try to reason with him.

### GL

### Agreed. He can't take this personal.

### They then hear a sonic boom off in the distance.

### BM

### Here he comes.

### SM is in the process of landing as he comes through the door, he heads straight for BM.

### SM

### Give me the motherbox that you found at the warehouse.

### BM

### Going somewhere?

### SM

### To kill a murderer.

### SM steps aggressively in BM's direction. He grabs BM's uniform and lifts him off the ground.

### SM

### Give it to me.

### BM

### No.

### SM

### I'm not gonna ask you again.

### GL

### He can't!

### (SM drops BM then turns to face GL)

### Why not?

### GL

### Because he doesn't have it.

### SM walks toward GL, AM and WW stands in his way.

### WW

### Don't do it.

### SM

### Or what?

### AM

### No good is going to come from this. Just take a minute and calm down.

### They each take one of SM's arms.

### He quickly flings them aside.

### GL

### If that's the way you want it.

### GL fires a burst from his ring in the shape of a battering ram that slams SM into the wall.

### As he stands JJ transforms into a serpent like dragon and coils around him. He quickly breaks free.

### SM

### Where is it?!

### BM

### Why?! What are you going to do? He nearly killed you.

### Gen Hardcastle enters the room.

### What in the hell is going on in here?

### SM

### It's not your concern.

### BM

### Going there will not bring her back.

### Just then the communicator that Orion gave GL starts to flicker. Then his image appears.

### O

### If you go to Apokolips it will break the treaty. If by some miracle you kill Darkseid, then that planet will descend into chaos that will spill over across the universe. There is no one that wants to see Darkseid dead more than me but he is a necessary evil. I'm sorry but you cannot go.

### SM

### I don't remember asking your permission.

### SM backhands the device off of the table.

### Green Lantern wraps a huge green fist around SM.

### GL

### I can't let you go Superman. You heard the man. Trust me when I tell you this, there is a great big universe out there. Its problems can quickly become ours.

### Gen Hardcastle has now called the President and has told them what is going on

### GH

### That's right sir, he is attempting to go to Apokolips. If he does the treaty will be broken. I don't think they can stop him. What do you want us to do?

### There conversation is being monitored by Cadmus. The members at the table discuss what can be done.

### AW

### Now what? What do you think General?

### GE

### I think I see an opportunity.

### AW

### What do you mean?

### LL

### No, he's right. Let SM destroy the rest of them and let our robots take care of SM.

### GE

### Exactly.

### Eiling contacts the white house and informs them of their plan.

### Pres

### I'm not sure. General Hardcastle?

### GH

### That is your call Mr. President.

### Pres

### Where is Faraday?

### CF

### I'm on my way to the lab now sir, I think I can reason with him, he trusts me.

### Pres

### What is your ETA?

### CF

### Ten minutes.

### GH

### This thing will be over in five.

### Pres

### Gen. Eiling, hold until further notified.

### LL

### We can't wait General, when he leaves we will not be able to get him back. We need to go now.

### Eiling ponders, then presses a button on the console in front of him.

### Milo?

### Milo

### (voice)

### Yes sir?

### GE

### Activate the robots.

### Milo

### (voice)

### Which ones sir?

### GE

### All of them.

### LL

### We are doing the right thing, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

### The distant building, on the outskirts of Metropolis, roof opens and a dozen robots almost a story tall launch into the night sky.

### Superman strains against the grip, GL strains as he increases the power of his rings to hold him. Sweat starts to form on his brow as cracks begin to form. The fist explodes in a green flash as GL is knocked into a wall and falls unconscious. AM delivers a right cross the staggers SM, followed by another and another as AM gives him all he has. SM finishes the winded AM with a solid punch. WW tries but soon falls to SM's might. BM turns to see blips approaching on the radar. He runs outside and fires up his jet to intercept the incoming threat. Flash is now whizzing around the room.

### SM

### Give it to me!

### Zipping back and forth briefly stopping each time.

### F

### Gotta catch me first.

### SM studies the motions and begins to focus on Flash, he can see him clearly now, SM's Body begins to mirror Flash's moves, the chase ends with Flash against a wall, SM's hand around his neck. He squeezes just enough for Flash to stop thrashing and calmly removes the mother box from his hands.

### SM

After that race you should have considered the possibility that I let you win.

### (He squeezes just enough for Flash to stop thrashing and calmly removes the mother box from his hands.)

### Thank you.

### SM crashes through the roof to find himself surrounded by 12 hovering robots. He looks over the shoulder of one to see the Bat Jet approaching.

### From inside the cockpit BM locks on and fires the four remaining missiles and takes out four robots. SM Grins when he realizes that he is there to help.

### The remaining league members go outside and watch the battle. BM is evading four pursuing robots and SM is locked up with the rest. They are flying circles around him blasting him with green laser beams.

### WW

### What do we do?

### GL

### After that beating he just gave us, I'm inclined to sit this one out.

### JJ

### They are our teammates.

### AM

### Our friends.

### GL

### (Shrugs)

### What the hell.

### Flash breaks up the circle by creating a tornado. WW lassos one around the neck as it flies by, she anchors the other end around a tree. The head snaps off and the body crashes into the ground. JJ phases out and one robot blasts through him destroying the other. He then enters the other and comes out behind it with one hand still inside. The robot freezes, raises an arm and begins to fire at the ones chasing BM. He takes out two and then rips out the wires, causing it to crash to the ground. Superman sees the break he needs and activates the mother box, the boom tube opens and he vanishes.

### Apokolips

### The mother ship is being unloaded as the light appears in the sky. SM flies by it as he circles the planet gathering momentum. He bears down and punches through the ship, with each lap around the planet he punches a new hole. The ship starts to fall with smoke coming out of every hole. SM hovers above as he rips the roof open. Darkseid and his minions stand away from the vessel as it crashes to the ground. SM sees the group as he passes over head. DS now has all of his crew, all of the ones he took to Earth and several others.

### DS (Steps back)

### DS

### Finish the kryptonian.

### They all look up as SM streaks across the sky. On his next pass he flies through the neck of DS's giant statue that stands about ten stories high.

### The head pops off and starts to fall to the ground, SM catches it on the next pass. The giant rock head slows him down but it does not matter. On his next pass he hurls it to the surface. The bad guys begin to flee but they are too late. The head hits like a meteor. Dirt, rocks and dust are scattered for miles. When the dust clears the bodies of Darkseid's forces litter the terrain. SM scans the bodies for DS, he cannot find him.

### SM

### Darkseid!

### DS is now hovering behind him

### DS

### Looking for me?

### SM

### You are going to pay for what you did.

### DS

### I doubt it, I never do.

### His eyes glow red but before he can fire SM flies into him, Punching holes into the surrounding buildings as he flies through them. SM Uses DS as a battering ram and starts to destroy the whole city.

### Star Labs

### Flash catches one of the robots on the ground as it tries to capture AM. Using a cable from a fallen tower he speeds around the robot and when he is finished it is wrapped from head to toe with the cable.

### F

### He's all yours.

### AM leaps and delivers a mighty punch and the robots head disappears in the nearby woods. GL has knocked one down and is slamming it into the ground with a giant anvil. BM's jet is struggling after being hit, "warning, warning" repeats itself from inside the cockpit. BM slows letting the robot catch up. "Remote detonation activated" is heard before BM punches out, as his seat tumbles upward he activates the EMP on the jet that knocks out the last robot.

### He descends slowly and lands near the lab, the rest of the league joins him.

### WW

### So the jet was an EMP too. You do think of everything.

### GL

### What do we do about Superman.

### BM

### Give me your mother box.

### GL hands it over.

### F

### Yeah lets go get him before he does something he regrets.

### JJ

### If he hasn't done it already.

### Apokolips

### SM is working DS pretty good but he will not stay down.

### DS wiping blood from the corner of his mouth.

### DS

### You seem more determined this time Kryptonian.

### SM

### A man once said something to me about being afraid of how powerful I really am. He was right, but there is another fear. Losing someone close to me. I have you to blame for that. By the time I am through you will know what it is like to be afraid. You will also know how powerful I am, too bad you won't be alive to tell anyone.

### They mix it up some more, DS gets one in and sends SM hurtling back through a wall. DS stomps repeatedly on SM's face it gets further into the stone floor. He stops and grinds his foot in SM's face.

### DS

### This is it Superman. As I said, you are but an ant and I am a God.

### DS's foot begins to smolder and glows red as SM's heat vision burns through his foot, causing him to hop backwards on one leg. SM takes off and flies straight up, stopping at the top of his loop, straight down and about six feet of the ground, after he breaks the sound barrier he hones in on his target. DS has no chance as SM delivers both fists to his chest. The impact causes a crater as dust and debris fly out in all directions.

### Metropolis

### BM hands the box to Flash

### BM

### Enter every possible sequence.

### Flash's hand is a blur

### F

### Got it.

### WW

### Lets go.

### BM

### No.

### GL

### What?

### BM

### We already know that we can't stop him, so powers won't matter. The world can survive without BM. Maybe it can survive without SM. It cannot survive without all of us.

### AM

### I understand what you are saying, but you started this with the intention of bringing all of us together. So let's finish it together.

### The rest stand behind AM.

### BM

### Okay, lets go.

### They walk calmly into the circle of light.

### Apokolips

### The boom tube opens and the league walks out and they begin to realize the destruction that has taken place. Some of the primitive temple shaped buildings are standing some are not, the decapitated statue still stands. They walk to the crater, bodies of Darkseid's elite are scattered over the landscape, some are alive some are not. Off in the distance they hear the pounding blows.

### BM

### (turns to the league)

### I hope we are not too late.

### JJ and WW take off, GL takes off and scoops up AM and BM in a green bubble, Flash speeds away. They passover the larger crater of SM's flying assault.

### WW

### Hera.

### They land and approach a rocky wall of a mountain. They stand silently at what they see. SM has beaten DS into the side of a mountain, his body is lifeless as SM steps back prepared to deliver DS to his maker.

### SM

### The only person left in this universe that I love was taken away from me by you. Make your peace to whomever you need to DS,

### SM lifts DS up with his left hand and his eyes begin to glow.

### The league steps forward and BM raises his arms, holding them back.

### SM hesitates as it begins to sink in what he is about to do. DS starts to grin from his battered face, blood drips from the corners of his mouth and his nose.

### DS

### What are you waiting for?

### SM begins to quiver with rage DS closes his eyes anticipating his own end. SM tosses DS away like a rag doll and begins to punch the mountain, chunks of rock chip away, the ground quakes, he yells in anger, it echoes throughout the land. He drops to his knees, bloody and tattered exhausted. He then feels a hand on his shoulder. He looks up to see BM. The rest of the league standing a few steps behind.

### BM

### (quietly)

### Lets go home Clark.

### SM stands and quietly walks away with his new friends. They stand as Batman operates the mother box. Flash speeds back to DS, who is still is barely conscious. From a distance they watch as Flash bends over and says something to DS. He speeds back .

### F

### (Addresses the group)

### I've always wanted to do that.

### The circle of light appears and they walk into it, headed back to Earth.

### New Genesis

### Orion watches as the circle of light shrinks to a shimmer.

### (voice of High Father)

### Is it over?

### O

### Yes. It seems we have some powerful new allies. Their group intrigues me.

### Star Labs

### The JL stands on the grass, surrounded by the aftermath of the worldwide attack. A helicopter lands and Col Faraday dismounts and approaches the league.

### CF

### (removes his helmet and shakes SM's hand)

### What happened?

### SM

### DS is defeated, alive but defeated. It will be a very long time before he will be able to wage war against anyone. How is Jimmy Olsen?

### CF

### He's gonna make it. The President is worried.

### SM

### Well, so are we. Who gave the order to unleash those robots?

### CF

### I haven't the slightest idea but I promise you I will find out. We have quite a bit of cleaning up to do.

### SM

### Give us a minute and we'll lend a hand.

### CF returns to the chopper.

### Several days later

### The cold chill in the air was announcing that fall was coming early. The throngs of people stood on the hill in the cemetery, Clark Kent and Perry White stood on each side of Jimmy Olsen who is in a wheel chair. Clark stares at the flower draped casket, the preacher finishes his eulogy and the crowd walks away. Later that day as the sun sets, Lois Lane gets one last visitor. SM stands silently as his cape blows in the breeze. SM takes a knee in front of the head stone.

### SM

### (sobbing)

### I'm sorry Lois, I was always there before. I'm sorry.

### BM

### (voice off screen)

### Even Superman can't be every where at once.

### SM stands and sees BM standing behind him.

### SM

### I know that now.

### BM

### I'm sorry that I didn't do more. I did not realize that you two were...

### SM

### (raises his hand)

### Some detective.(smirks) We were not, really. I wanted to but we never got the, you know. It's hard to explain.

### BM

### Not to someone that understands, and believe me I do.

### They walk quietly away to a clearing near the cemetery where BM landed his new jet.

### SM

### (With his hand on the wing)

### That was fast. Let me guess, you had a backup.

### BM

### Always.

### SM

### Given any more thought to what I said.

### BM

### Sounds like I may not have a choice. I read the article that you finished for Lois. The Justice League?

### SM

### I think it's kind of catchy, besides that was Lois's idea.

### BM

### Have you talked to the others?

### SM

### Yep, everyone is in but you. We even have our eyes on some others. We were not the only ones in action that day.

### BM

### Then it sounds like you don't need me.

### SM

### That's where you're wrong, Bruce.

### BM

### I'm better off on my own, Clark.

### SM

### That's what I thought. Well you know the date and time and place I hope to see you there.

### SM flies away, BM stands alone for a moment as he ponders the offer.

### As he is flying away.

### BM  
Lucius, this is Bruce. I want to meet with you tonight, there is something we need to do as soon as possible.

### LF

### (voice)

### A new project Mr. Wayne?

### BM

### No not a new one, just a conversion of an existing one. I'll see you in 10 minutes.

### About a month later SM stands in his fortress of solitude, standing in front of his computer console frustrated. Batman walks in.

### BM

### Problem?

### SM

### You could say that. Though I'm not really sure. I have been working on these robots to stand in for me if I am ever away. I get back the other day and the prototype is gone.

### (he points to a work station is empty, all that remains is the crude outline of a human figure)

### But that's not the most important thing, when I returned to Krypton I was able to retrieve some circuitry that was still intact. I was able to restore Krypton's central information system. I was going to upload that data to your computer. I did make a copy but all the original data is gone. It will take me months to restore the information.

### BM

### Did you have a break in?

### SM

### Not likely, no one can get in here anymore.

### BM

### What was the name of the central system?

### SM

### Brainiac.

### BM

### Is this going to be a problem?

### SM

### Time will tell. Why did you ask for that information anyway, the computer in the Batcave would not have held all that information anyway.

### BM

### Something I'm working on. I figure if this team is going to work we are going to need all the information we can get our hands on. I have constructed a system that should be able to handle it.

### SM

### So you are in?

### BM

### I'm here aren't I?

### WW lands beside the bat jet right after GL lands. A hole crashes through the ice and AM walks toward them. JJ and Flash are already inside. They sit at a table.

### F

### Nice place supes. Who's your decorator Captain Cold?

### SM

### (chuckles)

### F

### Please tell me this isn't going to be our usual meeting place. It's freezing in here.

### SM

### I know, sorry about that I don't feel cold like some of you. But it will have to do for a while.

### GL

### Not that I am complaining but we are going to need a facility that is a little more strategically located.

### BM

### Agreed. I'm working on that. For now this is the best place. We can't be too careful.

### WW

### Who are we hiding from?

### SM

### Cadmus.

### AM

### How much of a threat do they pose?

### BM

### Not sure. What I do know is they have gone silent since the invasion.

### F

### Since they saw that we had a counter punch to their robots.

### BM

### Exactly, they have slipped farther into the shadows. We know that Luthor is involved but he left no trail to follow.

### JJ

### And I can't sense him either. There is so much noise now, it is hard to pinpoint someone like I used to.

### WW

### Everyone knows you exist now, could that be it?

### JJ

### It is possible.

### BM

### In any event, I doubt they have halted their efforts to stop us. Professor Palmer is no longer with them. So I have lost my contact.

### AM

### Surface dwellers. Only they would not trust us after what we did.

### SM

### Not so fast AM, people fear what they do not know. We are going to change that. They are going to know about the Justice League. They will trust us because we are going to strive to earn it.

### GL

### It's going to take time. I've seen it on dozens of planets.

### WW

### How do we do that, knowing that the most powerful country in the world is plotting against us?

### SM

### Col Faraday assures me that neither he or Gen Hardcastle has any knowledge of a project Cadmus.

### BM

### And if Luthor is bank rolling them, they never will.

### Undisclosed location

### Luthor sits in a room full of shadowy figures as he quietly talks on the phone.

### LL

### That's right Ms. Waller. One of my people was able to get some of Superman's blood from the city. My people are analyzing it right now. When I know you will know.

### Lex hangs up and scans the room. Some faces are familiar, some are new. Sinestro, Solomon Grundy, Cheetah, Black Manta, Grod, Shade, Captain Cold, and Metallo.

### Sinestro

### What's all this about Luthor?

### I've have some serious disagreements with some people in this room.

### Metallo

### Well the last time I looked you weren't on my Christmas card list either.

### LL

### Gentleman please. This is precisely why I have asked you to be here. Did you all not notice what can happen when you combine your efforts? Our enemies did and look what they accomplished.

### Cheetah

### What are you getting at Lex?

### (Luthor rolls his eyes and stands quickly as he speaks)

### LL

### That we do the same!

### Grod

### But the league is already so powerful, and their numbers will grow.

### LL

### So will ours. What do you say?

### The room is silent as the others ponder the offer.

### LL

### Come on people if we stack the deck against them then we can't lose!

### Off screen a low laughter is heard that gets closer.

### The Joker walks in. (The members at the table grumble, one says, "Oh here we go.")

### LL

### What are you doing here?

### The Joker walks up and puts his arm around Luthor.

### Joker

### I heard there was this little meeting and imagine how hurt I was when I found out I wasn't invited.

### LL

### Everyone in this room was picked for a specific purpose. If we want to blow up the toilets at the Justice League headquarters then we'll give you a call.

### J

### Are you suggesting that I bring nothing to the table?

### LL

### I don't have time for this, Grundy, show Mr. Joker to the door.

### Grundy stands

### Grod

### Allow me Lex. This man is a dangerous fool.

### Grod approaches. He stands towering over the Joker.

### J

### Are you still mad that I ripped you off after you robbed that bank? I'm sorry, no hard feelings, huh?

### The Joker extends hand, Grod Grabs him by the coat and snatches him off of his feet. The Joker slaps Grod on the forehead and sparks begin to fly as Grod groans in agony and drops to the floor in a heap.

### J

### (in a high pitched voice)

### Shock the monkey! I always liked that song.

### J

### As I was saying, I bring more to the table than you could imagine. I'll let you in on a secret Lexy, the brains behind that outfit ain't the Martian or your boy in blue. It's the bat, and no one knows him better than me. Even a stacked deck needs a wild card. HAHAHAHAHAHA!

### Outside the Fortress of Solitude

### BM, GL, and F are walking toward BM's jet

### GL

### So do you think this little group can work together?

### BM

### (Glances at Flash, then back)

### Time will tell.

### (He turns to Flash)

### When you ran back to Darkseid, what did you say?

### Flashback to that day on Apokolyps

### A tight head shot of Flash bending over with a smirk on his face

### F

### Debow! You just got knocked the fu.......

### Music

### Credits

### After the credits you see Flash speed away as Batman an GL walk through the snow

### GL

### You had to ask.

### BM

### I know.
