###  Introduction.

An Introduction video is here

Hello and welcome to The Therapy shown in this book.

The Therapy is energy based in the following easy to use Parts:

### 1 – Getting Started

Involves clearing out harmful energy in the processes and systems closer to the surface of the body and filling them with beneficial energy. This will help conditions such as some types of asthma, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, hyperactivity and so on. Conditions caused by living in a polluted environment.

### 2 – Beginning Deeper Therapy

These methods will help strengthen the deeper functions and the emotional and mental state.

### 3 – Going Deeper

Help for pain relief and mental functions.

### 4 – Cells

Cells contain energies that give rise to inherited conditions and this energy takes time to get out and time to supply the cells with energy to restore health so perseverance is important.

The method for all conditions is basically the same: drawn out harmful energy and supply beneficial energy the body and immune system can use to restore health, only the materials used change.

It's new and different, but hopefully you will give it a try and receive substantial benefit.

Nothing can be promised but relief should start a few days after using The Therapy Part 1...

Good luck,

1 – Getting Started

*****

1.1 – Removing Harmful Energy

A Demonstration video of Part 1.1 is here

Part 1.1 materials used:

Picture above shows...

1) Antiseptic (left) with some in a plastic bag (red). A small amount of a powerful antiseptic will be needed.

2) Detergent. Any detergent powder or liquid placed in plastic bags can be used and the biological (with enzymes) ones are best. Powder is shown in yellow box, liquid shown in a green box in pouches which are less messy and easier to use. Either is fine.

3) Putty. A 1lb tub or half a kilo (right) with a putty filter in a plastic bag in front. Please use real putty made from chalk and linseed oil not a synthetic version.

4) Batteries. 8 will be needed to start. Double AA extra, more power or long lasting are good as they last longer and should supply enough energy for 1 person using parts 1.1 & 1.2 of The Therapy.

If you plan on doing all parts of The Therapy rechargeable batteries, shown at the front of the picture, are worth getting as the total number used will increase up to 24 later on and the batteries are used a lot and their energy is very important and The Therapy won't work if the batteries are left out or have no energy.

5) A bandage or something similar to hold the materials in place (centre).

6) Some thin, clear plastic bags to place the materials in (centre). Clear means they can be seen through and also test for allergies before use and don't use or stop if problems arise.

All materials can be bought either in a local shop or online.

You may even have some of the materials already in your home. No particular brand or product is best or recommended; just use good quality materials if possible.

Warning: Some of these materials, such as the detergent and antiseptic, are toxic. Do not consume and please wash your hands after use or wear gloves.

*****

###  Preparation:

1) Putty. Take some putty about the size of a hen's egg, roll it flat a few millimetres, about 1/8inch, thick and place it in a plastic bag. Repeat so you have 4 bags. These are your putty filters and all energy passing in and out of a person will pass through and be filtered by these.

2) Detergent. Pour a small amount, about the size of a hen's egg, of your detergent into a plastic bag and tie it. Work the air out of the bag before tying so it will lie flat. If you're using the liquid tabs use 2 or 3 per bag. Repeat so you have 4 bags. These are used by the immune system to pass harmful energy out of a person as the detergent has a powerful drawing effect on the harmful energy of fossil fuels, insect bites, contaminated bacteria and consumed insect material.

3) Antiseptic. Pour a small amount of the antiseptic, about the half the size of a hen's egg, into a plastic bag and tie it. Again work the air out before tying so it will lie flat. Repeat so you have 4 bags. Antiseptic energy is used by the immune system to break down and pass harmful energy out of a person.

4) Place 1 bag of detergent and 1 bag of antiseptic in a plastic bag and place 2 AA batteries in as well. Repeat so you have 4 bags each 1 containing 1 bag of detergent, 1 bag of antiseptic and 2 AA batteries.

These are your Part 1.1 materials.

*****

### Using Part 1.1:

### General:

Please note nothing is consumed.

Only harmful environmental energy by-products, mainly from insects and the burning of fossil fuels, that's not life supporting is drawn out of a person by The Therapy. The Therapy is helped in this drawing out process by a person's immune system which helps release the harmful energy by-products, ensuring that no life supporting energy is released.

The energy by-products from fossil fuels not only does harm when in people it also takes up space blocking life supporting energy from getting in, so the first step towards health is to remove it which is what Part 1.1 of The Therapy does. It also draws out harmful insect energy trapped in the energy system of a person.

The 2 main underlying acquired energy problems damaging health are: energy by-products from fossil fuels and the energy of insect bites and consumed insect material. These are the main supporting factors in many chronic conditions which The Therapy aims to remove and they inhabit the body's functions and process not the cells.

Other factors such as contaminated bacteria and mains electrical energy play a part, but the main factors are harmful energy by-products from fossil fuels, insect bites, consumed insect material and petrochemicals.

These harmful energies are acquired during life and not inherited and so are easier to get at being low hanging fruit. The deeper things such as strengthen the fabric and constitution of a person and the inherited conditions are dealt with further on.

Part 1.1 is used on the ankles and forearms first, and then the next day or few days later the same materials are placed on the neck, throat and stomach, above and below the belly button.

The materials stay on a person for about 2 hours each time used.

This being a general guide for The Therapy the number of times it's used can be increased if it's felt more are needed. Some people need a lot of cleaning out with Part 1.1, a lot of energising with Part 1.2, or both.

So if you feel more sessions are right for you then do them. The whole process is regulated by your own immune system so it will switch off when it's done so The Therapy can't be overused.

Start by placing 1 putty filter and 1 bag of materials on the outside edge of each ankle joint and 1 putty filter and 1 bag of materials on the inside surface of each forearm. The putty filter is always next to the skin with a bag of materials on top of it. Leave on for up to 2 hours.

Remove and store safely away from children and pets and recharge the batteries if using rechargeable ones. The bags may warm up and cool down when on, don't worry it means they're working. When they go cold they may be removed as that sessions over.

Store the materials safely and recharge the batteries if needed.

That's 1 session complete - covering the outside edge of the ankles and the inside surface of the forearms.

Part 1.1 will need to be used at least 3 times or 3 sessions in total. Use it more if you feel it's needed. Some heavily congested conditions, such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, allergies, hyperactivity and so on, will require more deep cleaning.

The pictures show the materials on the ankles and forearms. Bandages have been left off as much as possible to give a better view.

*****

### Method

1) Place a putty filter on the outside edge of each ankle joint and the inside of the forearms.

2) Place one bag of materials on top of each putty filter.

3) Bandage to hold in place being careful not to cut off the circulation.

Above: Materials on ankle joint held in place by a support bandage.

Above: Side view of materials on side of ankle joint.

It's easier to bandage the materials to the ankles first then rest the forearms on the putty filters and materials while resting on a bed or reclining chair.

Above: Forearms resting on putty filter with materials underneath.

After 2 hours remove and store safely, then next day or a few days later repeat placing the materials on the ankles and inside of the forearms for 2 hours then remove and store safely away from children and pets.

This is 1 session completed. At least 3 sessions in total will be needed, but do more if you wish.

Use again the next day or a few days later again for 2 hours on the ankles and forearms. Remove the materials and store safely.

This would complete the 2nd session then repeat again a few days later so you complete 3 sessions in total. Do more sessions if you feel you need it.

Sometimes when the bags are drawing out harmful energy they feel locked to the body and warm up which may well be a person's immune system using heat to transfer harmful energy. When the drawing out ends the bags feel like they slacken off while cooling down.

It's unlikely you will feel anything while harmful energy is being removed so have patience and stick with it. You will notice a surprising amount of difference in a day or 2 giving you the confidence to continue.

###  Infections

Please see your Doctor, Physician or medical professional first before anything else.

With infections, such as in the ear or leg ulcers, an extra bag of materials can be placed on putty filters near the infection to release harmful energy. Avoid using on broken skin and use Part 1.1 of The Therapy first.

Using Part 1.1 for an Ear Infection, below:

Apply 3 times as in the Therapy Part 1.1, or as often as desired.

*****

### Supplement Methods to Part 1.1

Silica gel may be used after Part 1.1 to receive more benefit and for more specialist conditions.

1.13 – Silica Gel

A recent development is the use of Silica Gel which is sometimes found in small packets in new electrical equipment and it's also used in dehumidifiers, amongst other things, but the bags used here are larger 4oz or 100grams sold online.

Caution: silica gel must not be thrown away or eaten, so please be careful with young children.

It helps draw out the energy of petrochemicals from a person.

Silica gel also helps different conditions, mostly bones, fluid and overall body conditions. Placing the bags on the back of the neck may help sharpen the eyesight.

It draws out artificial cold, explained later, from a person and it's good enough to be added to The Therapy as a supplement, used as follows:

Below: Large bags of silica gel are the ones used here. Smaller bags are often found in new appliances. The pen is for scale.

After using Part 1.1 of The Therapy make up 2 bags of materials with 2 or 3 large bags of silica gel and batteries, 4 to each bag, with the batteries behind and on top of the silica gel bags. Oils, such as linseed oil, can also be added to the bags for more energy if desired.

Place 2 putty filters on the lower back then place the bags with the silica gel and batteries on top and leave on for up to 2 hours. Take off and repeat twice more over a few days, again for up to 2 hours, making sure the materials are stored safely when not in use.

This will help the body in a general way.

With bone conditions such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis use the bags first on the lower back as just described, and then place 1 bag on top of a putty filter on top of each foot just below the toes and on, or near any painful area. With foot pain the instep is another good place for the bags.

Below: Silica gel resting on top of both feet with putty filters and batteries. Bandages have been left off for a clearer view.

With bandages:

Resting the insteps on the bags:

1.2 – Introducing Beneficial Energy

Now the harmful energy by-products from burning the dead material of fossil fuels has been drawn out it's time for the body to absorb beneficial, life supporting energy which comes from, oil, batteries and vitamins and minerals,

### Part 1.2 Materials used:

1) Putty filter (right on tub). You will need 2 from Part 1.1.

2) Batteries (centre) - the 8 from Part 1.1 Renew them, if they're not rechargeable, if you have doubts about the amount of energy they have left.

3) Oil. Any oil \- olive, fish, flax, linseed liquid or capsules (back row and centre left) - is fine so long as whatever is used comes from a fish or plant, not a petroleum product. Using more than 1 oil is ok and may be more beneficial as they are all slightly different, but don't mix them up, please use separate bags.

4) Vitamins and Minerals (centre, red pills mixed in with oil capsules). A tub of 60 to 90 good quality pills will be needed containing as many different vitamins and minerals as possible.

5) Thin, clear plastic bags from before (left).

6) Bandages to hold the materials in place (left).

Rice & Earth are shown but these are no longer used here.

*****

Preparation:

1) Putty filters, 2 from before.

2) Batteries. Place 4 batteries in 1 bag and 4 in another.

3) Oil. If using liquid pour a small amount into a bag about the size of half a hen's egg, squeeze out the air and tie. Repeat so you have 2 bags in total. If you're using capsules divide what you have into the 2 bags.

4) Vitamins and minerals and any other supplements you wish to add. Divide your supply in 2 and place in bags.

*****

General:

The putty filters and Part 1.2 materials are used on the lower back doing 3 to 5 sessions.

Each session should last for about 2 hours.

Place the bags with vitamins, minerals, oils in with the 2 bags containing 4 batteries in each. More batteries may be used if desired.

The pictures below show Part 1.2 being used.

*****

Method:

1) Place the putty filters on the lower back each side of the spine so the lower back is covered.

Place the 2 bags on top of the putty filters. Each bag contains 4 batteries, 1 bag of vitamins & minerals and 1 bag of oils. So it can be seen the picture shows face down, but lying on a bed face up with the materials under your back is probably easier and more comfortable.

Picture Below...

2) Leave on for up to 2 hours.

3) Please be careful not to cut off the circulation.

4) Remove, store safely away from children and pets.

5) Repeat the next day or later when convenient. Leave the materials on for 2 hours, remove and repeat a day or 2 later, 3 times in total.

Store the materials safely when not in use and charge the batteries in using re-chargeable.

Do extra sessions if you feel they're needed.

*****

1.4 – Serotonin

Serotonin should now be used.

Its energy regulates the stomach metabolism and regulates the body weight so a person may gain or lose weight depending on what a person's appropriate body weight is, but the real importance of serotonin is it prepares and helps clean out harmful insect life and energy from the blood, where it stores between the blood cells restricting their cohesion, and between the brain cells, restricting their communication (dementia), and also helps deal with the energy of petrochemicals along with The Therapy Part 1.1

Insect life and energy is a major factor in blood disorders when it's in the blood, and dementia when the space between the brain cells fill with it. This energy is transported to the brain by the blood.

Using serotonin cleans out the blood and space between the brain cell membranes which surround each cell and is preparation for the next step, which starts with the use of sea salt.

The areas of the body to use serotonin are the lower back and the stomach above and below the belly button.

1) Place the 2 putty filters on the lower back then place the materials on top so the putty filters are between the skin and the materials. Laying face up on a bed might be best for this.

2) Leave on for 2 hours and remove. Store safely and repeat the next day or a few days later for 2 hours.

3) Remove and repeat a few days later for the 3rd time.

Do more sessions if you feel they are needed and store all materials safely when not on use.

Using serotonin in this way, along with regulating the stomach metabolism, regulates the metabolism of the entire body especially the brain cells producing a smoother functioning between the cell membranes.

1.5 – Sterilising Tablets

A lot of illnesses tend to fall into one of two energy groups.

The two groups are: Illnesses caused by environmental pollution, insect bites and material and bacteria contaminated by environmental pollution and...

Illnesses caused by moulds and fungi.

The environmental pollution group which was looked at in The Therapy 1.1 includes asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, hyperactivity, allergies, cancer, autoimmune diseases and others although most of these illnesses have a main component causing them in the cells and cell membranes.

The moulds and fungi group include illnesses such as osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis, multiple scoliosis, brittle bones (MS in the UK), possibly MND and other bone or nerve conditions and it's the energy of moulds and/or fungi coating the bones or nerves that is causing the problem. So this energy has to come out and its sterilising tables that are used, the tablets used to sterilise babies bottles and other stuff.

Other antifungal tablets or liquid may work as well, but haven't been tried. See below...

One box will be enough along with all the batteries you have up to 24, 2 putty filters and some clear plastic bags.

Method:

Take 1 box of tablets (28) and empty them into 1 clear plastic bag and knot it, removing any air if possible.

Place all your batteries in 1 plastic bag and pace the bag of sterilising tables in with the batteries.

Take the 2 putty filters and lay them on your lower back with the batteries and sterilising tables on top.

Leave on for 2 hours remove charge the batteries and store safely.

Repeat again the next day placing the materials on your lower back for 2 hours. Remove, charge the batteries and store safely.

Repeat the next day and do 3 to 5 times in total. If you are suffering from a bone or nerve condition do more sessions.

Even a condition such as athlete's foot can indicate a fungal infection being present in the system.

Experience has shown most of us have fungal or mould present in out body so its recommended doing even if there's no sign of it and if you do have a bone condition use the calcium next.

Having done that well done you are ready to proceed.

*****

1.6 – Injury and Accident:

Part 1.6 may also be used on any damaged part of the body, such as broken bones, knee/cartilage/disc injury, by placing the putty filters and materials on or near where they are needed. Extra material, that is a handful, may be added to the bags such as calcium, glucosamine, silicone, collagen, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and so on to aid repair.

Remember when materials are referred to as helping it's the energy of those materials that's referred to.

It's a good idea to use The Therapy: Part 1.1 first if possible as its probably high energy pollutants in a person that's hindering recovery and weakened the body in the first place.

Using Part 1.6 usually lessens pain and speeds up recovery time.

Part 1.6 materials being used on Wrist or Arm Injury, below:

Extra batteries used will speed things up.

Where there's more widespread damage to the whole body the same materials used locally and any others you feel may help, can be used. Amino acids (strengthens the underlying or constitutional energy condition), creatine, horsetail, sea kelp and charcoal capsules (another energy cleaner), have been used at different times.

When a substance in the body loses its energy that substance can thicken up, become brittle and start to break up, like perished rubber. This can be a factor with bones, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis and nerves, soft tissues, MS and Parkinson's disease.

Using large amounts of materials in Part 1.6 is then needed, calcium, magnesium and zinc for the bones and copper and iron for the nerves. Batteries and oils will still have to be used to energise the materials used.

Small amounts of different metals such as lead (a cleaner of energy, acts like finings in wine), silver (restricts harmful energy processes), copper (energises the nerves and blood), iron (an energy stimulant) and zinc (for immune system processes), have also been used placing them in plastic bags like the other materials, but keep them separate from the batteries to avoid shock. Oils will also have to be used for energy.

The main point here is to use controlling substances or precursors which govern how other substances in the body are used. Examples of this would be the energy of amino acids strengthening the DNA and silicon & collagen energy overseeing protein use.

The main place to use Part 1.6 materials is the lower back with some supplemental use by any injury.

The Therapy has been used for injury to the hips and lower back damaged due to a car accident and other injuries such as broken bones when calcium was used. A lot of batteries were used, about 24 so now would be a good time to increase the batteries used.

The putty filters will also be used along with amino acids, calcium, zinc and magnesium.

Clear plastic bags, as before, will also be needed.

### Method

Take your part 2 bags and place in them bags of extra materials containing the amino acids, calcium, zinc and magnesium along with any other materials you wish to use.

A small handful is enough and only 1 bag of each is needed so spread them out between the Part 1.6 bags.

For this the bags are placed on the lower back for 2 hours and the next day or later on, or near the problem for 2 hours without causing pain or making things worse.

If it's not possible to do this just use the bags on the lower back.

For the lower back lay face down on the floor or bed and place 2 putty filters on your lower back with the 2 bags of materials placed on top of the putty filters.

Or if it's more comfortable lay the materials on a bed or something soft, place the putty filters on top and lay back so your lower back makes contact with the putty and you're face up.

Leave on for about 2 hours.

Take off and store safely, replace of recharge the batteries as needed, and repeat the next day near any injury or problem. Leave on for about 2 hours.

Take off; repeat using the same materials, the next day back on the lower back and leave on for about 2 hours.

Take off and repeat the next day, or after a few days near the injury or problem with the putty filters on the skin with no clothing between them with the materials on top of the putty filter.

Leave on for about 2 hours then remove and store safely.

When working and the body is absorbing the filtered energy essence of the materials used, the area may become warm, but that's ok it just means its working.

So if there is heat it can be a guide, to continue placing the bags on until no more energy is absorbed and the body stops getting warm.

In any case 3 sessions on the lower back and 3 elsewhere will probably be enough.

It will take time for the energies to work through the body helping recovery, 1 to 2 months, but the effect will go on for years as the body will always use the energy available to it to improve health, the general body condition, fight illness and so on.

Using The Therapy like this, with lots of batteries, is also useful for any bone condition, for which use calcium as well and the body will learn, from the putty filters how to filter energy itself to produce useful energy.

2 – Beginning Deeper Therapy

Please note, as with The Therapy Parts 1.1 & 1.2, nothing in Part 2 is consumed \- ever.

The materials are used in the same way as in The Therapy Parts 1.1 & 1.2

Going deeper intends to bring to an end all distortion and damage in a person so development can restart and progress along a beneficial path according to the direction given by the immune system.

Beneficial in this book means the ending of pain, stress and disorder, or taking a path that leads away from them.

Harmful in this book means that which creates pain, stress and disorder, or taking a path that leads to them.

Nothing used in The Therapy is forced on a person.

Your own body will absorb the energies of the different materials used taking only the amount needed.

Change won't be forced upon you. If you wish to change it will happen in your own time with you in control.

The Therapy supplies the energy for change which you can use as and when you're ready.

It can be done gradually by slowly letting go, or you can do it all at once, or somewhere in between - the choice will be yours probably made at a very deep level.

Powerful emotions such as rage, anger, fear, hatred, violence, greed, jealousy and other unpleasant emotions are helped at the deeper, cellular level with Part 4.1 using graphite powder.

Part 2 here deals with them nearer the surface of human existence.

*****

Part 2, starts with salt because that is a carrier for other energies needed. Sea salt is best because that energy combined with the first life in the oceans and has stayed with us ever since, until that is, it was destroyed by chemical additives in food.

Once the salt energy is damaged and lost all the energies that it transports are damaged or lost as well and people change.

A person can have adequate levels of salt in their bodies or diet, but that's not the problem, it's the non-functioning of the salt energy that's the problem. This non-functioning leads to an over consumption of salt to try and restore its functioning but it doesn't help.

*****

2.1 – Sea Salt

Shown in Wikipedia here

The Therapy Parts 1.1 & 1.2 plus serotonin and silica gel needs to be used first to empty and prepare the body and to rid the body of the energies of petrochemicals, their by-products, tobacco and any other stimulants.

Filtered salt energy is a great protector of the body and an essential first step towards recovery.

The materials used are 2 - 350g tubs of sea salt, 2 putty filters, or 1 large one which is a bit easier to use, all the batteries you have, 24 are shown in the picture and used here, and some clear plastic bags.

All materials used in Part 2 are reusable. The carbohydrate and chemicals can be used many times over on different people, they don't run out of energy, but regenerate between uses. If non rechargeable batteries are used they will need replacing, of course.

Materials shown in picture below:

2 - 350g tubs of sea salt emptied into 1 bag.

1 large putty filter. Using 2 smaller 1's is ok.

All the batteries you have - 24 are shown here, new or recharged.

Clear plastic bags - the roll between the batteries.

Method:

Empty 1 tub of sea salt into 1 clear plastic bag and knot it. Empty the other tub of salt into a clear, plastic bag and knot it so you have 2 bags.

Place the batteries into 2 clear plastic bags, half of your supply in each.

The place used is the lower back.

As always please store the materials used safely away from children and pets after use.

The method used is the same as before: place the putty filters on the lower back with the batteries and sea salt on top and leave on for about 2 hours for each session.

Use this method 3 to 5 times.

The body will stop absorbing salt energy when it has enough, like when full we stop eating. This is true of any materials used in The Therapy, and the bags will feel like they have stopped working. If you feel this move on to the next material used.

*****

The Therapy Part 2 will continue with sodium bicarbonate next, then other foods.

The list of foods to use is nearly endless so all that can be done here is to outline the method and use the main foods, and explain a bit about them, and perhaps return to study other foods later or leave it to others and future generations.

Some energies combine with salt energy where they flow around the body and will require more sessions, on more places on the body to fill the body up.

Main carbohydrate energies, such as from potatoes, wheat, corn, oats, millet and rice, will by-pass the salt energy and flow directly into the energy of a person, so will need less sessions, done on the lower back and stomach.

The next two materials used sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulphate work to strengthen and promote main, prime carbohydrate energies.

It all comes from basic food and chemicals, the different combinations of which are endless. This means that human life can be tremendously complex and can explore just about any possibility, and when such action comes from wholesome food and ingredients no harm will be done to others or the planet.

Problems start, as has been said before, when this process is damaged, destroyed or added to by the action of consumed petrochemicals from additives, fertilisers, sprays, waxes, mineral oils, gasses and so on which introduce damaging energies into the bodies energy and general condition, which change or damage how other energies work, in this case changing a person's feelings, emotions and mental states.

*****

Using salt is an essential part of the health process protecting the body so strictly speaking it could be classed in with Part 1.1 & 1.2, which is to end pain and suffering and return a person to health, where possible, but it forms the beginning of Part 2.

The Therapy Part 2 endeavours to eliminate internal distortion, suffering and harmful mental, behavioural and emotional conditions in a person, so its goals are an extension of Parts 1.1 & 1.2.

More explanations will be given during Part 2 as we proceed.

*****

2.2 – Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda)

Please note if baking soda is used please use the soda and not powder which is a diluted form. A Wikipedia link is here.

Sodium bicarbonate has been added to human diet for the last 200 years in bread making. It has been consumed before then, but adding it to bread made it more widespread, taking entire populations over the threshold where its energy is acted upon.

It's a chemical which appears to stimulate the analytical parts of the brain giving rise to a more technological society. Its action in humans has been accelerated in recent years by the addition of petrochemicals in the diet and environment, through inhaling, for instance.

The difference between fossil fuels that damage the body on a more surface energy level and petrochemicals is that fossil fuels damage body processes after burning, when it's in a more gaseous state, whereas petrochemicals distort body processes without being burnt, as food additives and even powerful smells, for instance through inhaling at petrol stations, road works etc.

Burning fossil fuels releases their energy into the environment allowing them to cause damage on the a more surface level of human physical existence becoming a factor in many illnesses and other conditions.

Consuming petrochemicals is on a more physical level causing damage on a deeper level of human existence giving rise to mental conditions and emotional and behavioural problems.

Petrochemicals have a distorting effect on the action of sodium bicarbonate in people stimulating it to the point where it's out of control, producing a society with unbalanced technology which is the same - out of control with no restraint.

Once the damaging energy of petrochemicals has been removed from a person sodium bicarbonate can be used to strengthen, regulate or restrain sodium bicarbonate's action in humans so a balance is found whereby technology has a more appropriate place in life and where more rational choices can be made concerning it.

Sodium carbonate also acts like an accelerant for the energies of carbohydrates which come next.

Above shows:

Bicarbonate of soda at the back with the contents placed in 2 clear, thin plastic bags shown on top of the putty filters. 2 tubs of 180gms, or about 6ozs, each are used.

Batteries: AA 1.2v front and centre and bagged each side of the bicarbonate of soda tubs. A lot will be needed. 24 rechargeable are shown and used here.

Clear, thin plastic bags, centre in a roll.

Putty filters. 2 in front left and right of the bag of batteries.

Preparation:

Use the same putty filters, clear, thin plastic bags and batteries used before in The Therapy, Parts 1 & 2. The batteries need to be new or fully charged if rechargeable.

Divide the batteries in half and place each half in a clear, thin plastic bag.

Empty 1 tub of bicarbonate of soda into a plastic bag and knot it. Repeat the same with the other tub.

Method:

Please remember: nothing is consumed, ever.

Sodium bicarbonate energy flows and joins with the energy of sea salt used earlier, so the whole body has to be covered.

The area of the body used for the bags is the lower back.

Place the materials each side of the spine on the lower back being careful not to cut off the circulation or cause any kind of damage. The putty filters are placed against the skin with the bicarbonate of soda bags and the battery bags placed on top.

Leave on for 2 hours and repeat once or twice more with a day apart...

When in place the bags sometimes warm up which means they're working. The heat will peak and start to cool down which means they've finished working and can be removed, so the amount of time they are used may be adjusted accordingly.

Having worked through The Therapy Parts 1.1 & 1.2 some experience in using it, and how your own body works will have been gained, so using Part 2 should be easier and quicker.

Well done, you've reached the end of using sodium carbonate, so when ready, after a day or 2, move on to:

*****

2.3 –Magnesium Sulphate (Epsom Salts)

A Wikipedia link is here.

This is the same as the method just used except the sodium carbonate bags are replaced with magnesium sulphate, otherwise known as Epsom salts.

Magnesium sulphate is used in agriculture for crops such as potatoes and tomatoes and from which it enters humans where its action gives rise to a type of human behaviour or character.

This character may be seen as straightforward and honourable without malice or spite.

Its action in humans has been changed by the action of consumed, and/or inhaled, petrochemicals which, like sodium bicarbonate, over stimulate the action of magnesium sulphate in people leading to extremes in behaviour turning humans more excessive.

With human behaviour there has to be just the right amount of appropriate energies acting as a regulator.

Use of magnesium sulphate also acts as a supporting energy for carbohydrate energy giving them a boost.

The introduction of certain foods such as potatoes, wheat, oats, cane & beet sugar, tobacco, corn, rice, millet, tea, coffee etc into new parts of the world introduces new elements into human behaviour, emotions and ways of thinking.

Physical changes also come about as well, for instance, potatoes tend to create people the same shape as the potato root.

There's nothing inherently wrong in any of this so long as the changes are healthy and lead to a beneficial way of life. It's all human interaction with the environment.

Materials:

Picture below shows...

Epsom salts at the back with the contents placed in 2 clear, thin plastic bags shown on top of the putty filters. 2 tubs of 200gms, or about 7ozs, each are used.

Batteries: AA 1.2v front and centre and bagged each side of the bicarbonate of soda tubs. Part 3 requires a lot. 24 rechargeable are shown and used here.

Clear, thin plastic bags, centre in a roll.

Putty filters. 2 in front, to the left and right of the bag of batteries.

Preparation:

Use the same putty filters, clear, thin plastic bags and batteries used before in The Therapy, Parts 1.1 & 1.2. The batteries need to be new or fully charged if rechargeable.

Divide your supply of batteries in half and place each half in a clear, thin plastic bag.

Empty 1 tub, or about 200gms, of Epsom salts into a plastic bag and knot it. Repeat the same with the other tub.

Method:

Epsom salt energy flows and joins with the energy of sea salt used earlier, so the whole body has to be done.

The area of the body used is the lower back with each session should last up to 2 hours.

This is going to be the procedure from now on 3 – 5 sessions on the lower back each 1 lasting 2 hours.

Place a bag of Epsom salts in a bag of batteries with a putty filter placed on top.

Then repeat with the other material then rest them on the putty filters on the lower back for up to 2 hours.

Repeat 2 or 3 times a day apart. After each session store the materials safely away from children and pets and recharge or change the batteries if needed.

Again lying on a bed with your lower back resting on the materials is probably the best and easiest way to do this.

Leave on for 2 hours and repeat once or twice more with a day apart.

When in place the bags will sometimes warm up which means its working. When they cool down it means they've finished working, so the amount of time they are used may be adjusted accordingly.

The warming and cooling of the bags is the same for all the methods used in The Therapy.

So long as the materials are kept clean and hygienic they can be used repeatedly on different people.

The carbohydrate energies form the basic, background energy of a person's life, usually the staple one being at the forefront. If you have never eaten potatoes, rice, millet or any of the others then they aren't needed to repair and energise their energy in you, as it's not there and using them may be missed out, but you may wish to use them to gain the characteristics they offer.

Next, when you're ready, move on to...

*****

2.4 – Potato Starch

A Wikipedia link is here

Below are the materials used:

Everything is the same as before with the Epsom salt bags being replaced with 500grams of potato starch divided into half, shown in the 2 bags sitting on the putty filters in the picture.

Only the lower back is used.

Place the putty filters on the lower back with the bags of potato starch on top.

Use all the batteries you have, 24 are used here, the usual rechargeable double AA's.

Do 3 to 5 sessions a day or two apart for 2 hours each session.

Store everything safely when not in use and keep the batteries charged.

Potato starch is much better to use than potato flour or whole potatoes as their bulk contains ingredients which will block the method used here from working as well. In this form the energy of the material is also more easily released.

If potato starch is unavailable try potato flour or anything similar.

Potato starch, like the carbohydrates that follow, can be used repeatedly on different people. just make sure everything used is kept dry, clean and hygienic.

When potatoes supply the main carbohydrate energy in an area it rounds the character producing a person generous, tolerant, self-reliant but lacking in confidence, inquisitive, curious, emotionally solid, ponderous, slow to change, cautious, having a desire to be rooted in the ground with good social support. They're also helpful, reserved and somewhat sanguine, amongst other things.

Too many potatoes can also round the body and make a person mentally and physically sluggish.

Carbohydrate energies fix a person's basic state, the backdrop to their life, and define that person's approach to life, their framework, foundation and their basic attitude, amongst other things.

Energy from food is what makes humans work. It is what it is, producing people as they are, and adverse effects are only introduced when this process is damaged or distorted by the action of petrochemicals, or that energy gets into people.

Next is yeast, when you're ready to continue...

*****

2.5 – Yeast

Another energy to prepare the body for the energy of carbohydrate.

A wikipedia link to yeast is here

The filtered energy of yeast in the human body acts as a regulator, especially for the energy of sugar and it reduces the desire to consume sweet things.

Yeast also releases much stored energy near the surface that's in a person such as energy in contradiction, the most powerful being anger which leads to violence, but also includes such things as resentment and frustration.

It's too late to use these energies constructively once it's been stored, as storing it changes it.

Also released are the energies of pain, suffering and hurt acquired from others and stored in us simply because we are damaged internally through the action of consumed petrochemicals. This acquired hurt and pain from others is more vicious and goes deeper than hurt and pain generated within, simply because it's inflicted from outside, driven by another's pain, or even a group, to go deeper, from outside in.

Pain and hurt from others needs to be released and let go of. It can't be used to motivate thought and action the way emotions naturally occurring can, again as it's been stored.

This energy from others needs to be released as it's acquired, rather that stored and accumulated, otherwise it will constantly express itself adversely with aggressive, abrasive, disruptive, adversarial behaviour followed by anger, rage and violence.

Yeast helps this energy to be released rather than expressed.

The materials used are shown in the picture below...

Any good quality, inexpensive materials will do. No particular brand is recommended.

Everything is the same as before with the potato starch being replaced with bread yeast.

The box contained 6 x 7gram sachets which were opened and poured into 2 clear plastic bags, 3 sachets in each, and the bags knotted.

The rest of the materials are the same: 2 putty filters each in a plastic bag, 24 AA batteries placed in 2 plastic bags, half in each and a roll of clear, thin plastic bags.

Only the lower back will be used for this. 1 or 2 sessions each of up to 2 hours will be enough.

Baker's yeast is shown and used here, and together with brewer's yeast, has been used in baking and fermenting for many centuries adding its energies to individuals bringing about local change, but it's only since it's widespread use in the last few centuries that cultures and societies have changed due to its influence.

Place the putty filters on the lower back with the bags of potato starch and batteries placed on top. Use all the batteries you have, 24 are used here, the usual rechargeable double AA's.

Leave on for 2 hours and repeat the next day.

*****

As said, a lot of powerful stored emotions, from resentment and frustration through to anger, will start to leave the system after a few days. This will be the residual energy of unpleasant experience stored over many years, probably from an early age, so there will be a lot of it.

These feelings and emotions may be from understandable sources, such as viewing mistreatment or injustice, but they all need to go, and what turns them into problems is storing them where they have a ongoing powerful effect making them self-reinforcing, like being in a loop, dominating a person's emotional state.

Allow this energy, if possible, to release and dissipate without it having an angry, violent or adverse expression. It needs to be released not expressed and it will happen at its own pace.

Realise what's happening, that these feelings are going and will soon be gone, stand back and try not to interfere with the process the yeast has set in motion.

It's a good time for understanding friends and to learn by watching what's coming out and being released. These powerful energies have shaped your life, and now, through observation, insight and understanding, that life will now start to change and emotional energies, as they arise, will be used to help a person into appropriate action.

Try not to judge yourself as things come out; rather be glad it's happening. If you have worked through The Therapy Parts 1.1, 1.2 and now 2 it shows good character and a desire to change.

Next, when you are ready, move on to using vinegar...

*****

2.6 – Vinegar

Fruit vinegar is used here, and along with the energy of baker's yeast, prepares the body for the energy of wheat which are used in bread making. The energies of wheat and yeast work well together.

Baking soda is also used in bread making, but it was more appropriate to use it earlier to prepare the way for the energy of potato starch.

Bread is one of the main foods that have helped form humans over the centuries, contributing to what we are which has lead to a type of society and civilisation. The braking of these energies, through the use of petrochemicals, has damaged and distorted the human character and psyche which has lead to changes in society and civilisation.

The aim of The Therapy Part 2 is to restore the functioning of those energies.

Filtered vinegar energy works as a stimulant and is an invigorator for other energies...

The picture above shows the materials used:

A fruit vinegar, plum, has been used here and is much better than the commercial alternatives used in chip shops and shouldn't be used. Plum vinegar was used as it was to hand. Any fruit vinegar will do and different ones may have slightly different actions.

The other materials are all as usual:

2 putty filters in plastic bags.

An amount of vinegar, about the size of a small hen's egg, is poured into a clear, thin plastic bag and knotted. Repeat so you have 2 plastic bags, shown on top of the putty filters.

AA batteries, 24 rechargeable ones are used here divided into 2 thin, clear plastic bags. A roll of which can be seen in the picture.

Method:

The same as before placing materials on the lower back for up to 2 hours at a time.

Repeat once or twice.

As you gain experience with the method, and your own body, you may wish to lengthen or shorten the times or increase or decrease the number of sessions.

This is another material like yeast only needing to be applied to the lower back, from which, due to its fluid nature, its energy will flow around the body to where it's needed.

The putty filters are placed on the body with the batteries and bags of vinegar placed on top. As always nothing is consumed and be careful you don't cut off the circulation and the bags of vinegar don't leak.

After each session store the materials used safely away from children and pets.

Filtered vinegar energy, along with that of yeast, prepares the body for the energy of carbohydrate by invigorating the internal energy condition. Filtered vinegar energy, coming from fruit, has a natural affinity for the body's energy condition, as it will disperse and permeate the energy, just as fruit does on the ground.

The filtered bran energy from wheat, which comes next, needs the preparation of the vinegar which, amongst other things, acts as a stimulant to other food energies.

When you're ready continue on to wheat bran...

*****

2.6 – Wheat Bran

Wheat bran in flake form is the best way to use wheat with The Therapy, and that's true of all the carbohydrate foods used, as in grain form their energies are more compact and retained in the grain, whereas as flakes their energy is already radiating and easier to draw out.

If wheat bran is unavailable, try wheat flour, brown if possible.

The picture below shows the materials used...

No particular product is recommended, the 1's shown happened to be on offer when bought. Use any that are readily and cheaply obtainable.

The picture shows:

A 750 gram box of wheat bran flakes, centre, with about 2 handfuls of bran in 2 clear, plastic bags, left and right, close to the box.

Place about 2 handfuls of bran flakes into a plastic bag and knot it, or pour in about that amount, it doesn't have to be exact. Repeat so you have 2 bags with bran flakes in.

A roll of clear, thin plastic bags, centre.

24 rechargeable AA batteries, as before, divided into 2 clear plastic bags.

2 putty filters shown under the batteries. The putty filters are in plastic bags, so the only material ever to touch the skin is the plastic.

Wheat bran is used on the lower back and stomach.

Method:

Place 2 putty filters either side of the spine on the lower back with 1 bag of bran and 1 bag of batteries on each. Leave on for up to 2 hours and repeat once or twice more over the next few days. Store the materials safely when not in use.

It's easier to lay the materials on a bed with the putty filters on top of the bags of bran and batteries, then to lie on the bed so you're lower back rests on top of the putty. Make sure no clothing's between you and the putty and be careful not to cut off circulation in any way.

Wheat is a comforter and the type of food people turn to for comfort eating.

Filtered wheat energy has a relaxing, satisfying, releasing quality similar to that of yeast, except it goes much deeper in a person. It contributes a certain coldness to outsiders in people, aloof, holding them at arm's length. It creates the desire for a large, strong family that's very clannish.

Used with oats, shown later, it can help with physical pain especially that caused by rheumatoid arthritis.

Wheat has an energy with a feeling of autumn that turns people inward, preparing for change.

Filtered wheat energy isn't a strong energy so it tends to create people who change easily as their not particularly rooted in ways or beliefs. Such people are usually smaller that average and as wheat energy isn't so dominating, other energies tend to take over, especially from oil.

*****

2.7 – Corn or Maize

The picture below shows the materials used...

Above shows a 375gram box of corn flakes, 2 bags of corn flakes, a roll of clear, thin plastic bags and 24 AA batteries divided into 2 bags resting on 2 putty filters.

Only 1 bag of corn is needed not 2 as shown.

The method and materials are the same as wheat bran except now corn flakes are being used.

Corn is used for carbohydrate. If corn flakes are unavailable try something similar such as corn starch.

Method:

The place use is the lower back.

Place a handful of corn flakes into a plastic bag and knot it, or pour in about that amount, it doesn't have to be exact.

Place the materials for up to 2 hours on the lower back for up to 2 hours.

As always the putty filters are placed on the body with the batteries and materials placed on top.

Laying face up on a bed while doing this may be the easiest way.

After a few days repeat again on the lower back doing 2 sessions in total.

Make sure the batteries are fully charged and safely away from pets and children when not in use.

Corn is an energiser.

Corn has stored a great deal of the sun's energy as shown by its colour. When consumed as the predominate carbohydrate food in a society the sun's energy in corn gives rise to energetic, enthusiastic, driven people interested in many things.

This energy is very much a surface energy so people study broadly rather than deeply, more for the eyes than the soul. Societies created by such people tend to be scientific and materialistic - what the eyes can see by reflected light.

Filtered corn energy gives rise to open, warm, optimistic, positive, friendly people who heat up quickly and cool down slowly. Like the sun rising and setting, so too in people, creating a society that will be both young and immature: rising, and older and more mature: setting. People, and society, will have characteristics of both.

Filtered corn energy is light, creating people who are without roots, tending to live on the surface of their lives, spreading their activities around. They can be very competitive. Sometimes they can give hurt and not know it, but it's not deliberate, it's part of corn energies immaturity.

Used in The Therapy, as well as helping to restore the above, filtered corn energy contributes to stability, openness and a feeling of completeness and mixing with the other carbohydrate energies in a person tempers it allowing it to become a great source of strength and fortitude.

With corn energy what you see is what you get, it don't do subtlety, and please note, carbohydrate supplies base energy, or a base coat, which can be covered over and concealed by other more vibrant energies, so what a person has deep down, isn't always obvious.

*****

2.8 – Rice

The picture below shows the materials used, all that's been changed from the last one is the corn has been replaced with brown rice flakes. If rice flakes are unavailable try the nearest to it such as rice flour or cereal.

Rice is used for its carbohydrate and was removed from part 1.1 as its being used here...

Above shows a 500gram box of brown rice flakes, 2 bags of rice flakes resting on 2 putty filters, a roll of clear, thin plastic bags and 24 AA batteries divided into 2 bags.

Only 1 bag of rice is used for this not 2 as shown.

The method and materials used are the same as for corn except now rice flakes are being used.

Rice flakes are used as in flake form the rice releases its energy which, in grain form would be a lot harder to draw out.

Method:

Place a handful of rice flakes into a plastic bag and knot it, or pour in about that amount, it doesn't need to be exact.

Place the materials for up to 2 hours on the lower back.

Take off and after a few days repeat on the lower back, again for up to 2 hours.

As always the putty filters are placed on the body with the batteries and materials placed on top.

Laying face up on a bed while doing this may be the easiest way.

Do 2 sessions with the rice in total.

Make sure the batteries are always fully charged and safely away from pets and children when not in use.

Having got this far using the different materials of Part 2 things should start to change.

The individual energies of different carbohydrates will strengthen and repair those energies in a person, and introducing new energies from food not eaten before will introduce new characteristics from that food, but the biggest change comes about when all the different energies mix and combine bringing about a transformation in a person giving rise to new abilities and perceptions, insights and skills at all levels.

Slowly the burden of the past will recede and a new person will emerge.

You are being upgraded and while those changes may be deep, meaningful, complex even profound, they are never wrong, as it's part of the full human experience. Things can only go wrong when people are damaged or distorted by the action of powerful chemicals unnatural to us.

Filtered rice energy goes deep into a person blending with the water in their bodies. In the bodies water the energy expands reaching its potential, just the same as when the paddy gets flooded.

Filtered rice energy is essentially for the mind. It spreads through the body's water entering the mind where qualities of depth, clarity, penetration and insight are imparted. Rice energy is subtle, stubborn and likes to keep itself to itself, preferring to stay pure rather that mix with the other energies of carbohydrate which it feels are for the body not the mind.

Filtered rice energy is an isolator creating people who like to be alone even in groups. They have a private part inside that nothing touches which they preserve even when part of big families. It's how they create and protect their identities.

Rice is a compact grain, like wheat, producing people with a secret self that nobody ever sees. They tend to form hidden, secret groups and they build societies where the spiritual and other worldly things flourish over the mechanical and material.

On its own in a person, without the other energies of carbohydrate, rice energy can lead to a person and society being isolated with a sense of self-importance, however in a body with other carbohydrate energies, even if it avoids mixing or compounding with them, balance will be achieved and the energy of rice will contribute much to a person and their development.

When ready, after a day or 2, move on to...

*****

2.9 – Millet

The picture below shows the materials used, all that's been changed from the last one is the rice has been replaced with millet flakes. If millet flakes are unavailable try the nearest you can get such as millet flour or cereal. Millet is used for carbohydrate...

Above shows a 500gram box of millet and 2 bags of millet resting upon 2 putty filters.

The picture shows 2 bags of millet but only 1 bag was used. The materials were reduced when experience found a second bag wasn't needed.

24 AA batteries are used divided in half into 2 bags.

The roll of bags are the usual clear, thin plastic ones.

As millet is used for its carbohydrate energy its use the same as the others - twice on the lower back with sessions lasting up to 2 hours each.

Method:

Same as before with 1 putty filter placed on the lower back with 1 bas of millet with the batteries placed on top. Leave on for up to 2 hours, remove and store safely, and recharge or renew the batteries if needed.

After a day or 2 repeat on the lower back for 2 hours.

Filtered millet energy is a facilitator; it prepares the way or the ground for other energies allowing them to pass through the body smoothly. It's a base energy, cooling down the energy content of a person, turning down the heat in their thoughts and emotions. It reduces desire, passion and the need for hurried change without thought.

Filtered millet energy calms everything down, taking off the pressure, so people have time to think, consider and reflect allowing real character to come forth from them, and develop. It takes the heat out of people and situations.

It adds little to a person, like the other carbohydrate energies do, but its presence allows everything else to flourish. It's a very kind energy promoting the coming together and movement of internal energy. It has a timeless quality, the same as the deep forest, and it passes that on to humans.

This energy promotes expression, self honesty and a willingness to look at the past.

The filtered energy of millet is truly a friend to humanity imparting, not so much virtues and characteristics like the other carbohydrates, but a means to get there, a helping, or smoothing, of the way.

Next, when ready, move on to...

*****

2.11 – Oats

The picture below shows the materials used with the millet from last time being replaced by a 750gram bag of oat porridge. Also shown are 2 clear plastic bags filled with about 2 handfuls of oats which are then knotted. About half the bag of oats were used. The oats are resting on 2 putty filters with a roll of clear plastic bags and 2 plastic bags filled with 24 AA batteries, half in each bag.

All as before and the methods the same...

Method:

Only 1 bag of oats is needed for this not 2.

Oats are used for their carbohydrate energy and the flake or porridge form is best. If this is unavailable try oat cereal or whatever you can find that's close.

The lower back are the areas of the body the materials are placed, in 2 sessions of up to 2 hours each.

Start on the lower back placing the putty filters each side of the spine, then place the bag of oats and batteries on top of the putty filters and leave on for up to 2 hours.

After 2 hours, or when you feel they have finished, remove, store safely and recharge or change the batteries if they need it.

After a day or 2 repeat on the lower back for 2 hours then remove and store safely.

Oats give strength to the mind, body, character and emotions giving people qualities of endurance without becoming indifferent to the suffering of others.

Filtered oat energy imparts constitutional strength and stoicism in the face of adversary. The strength of oats can also be used, in the same way as above, on pain in the body, especially that caused by rheumatoid arthritis. Using it with the wheat bran used earlier is even better with the materials used placed, or wrapped directly on or as near to the pain, as possible.

Oat strength loves preserving and maintaining giving rise to people who are direct, straightforward, rational, inventive, clannish, adversarial, supportive, stubborn, solid, humble, truthful with a feeling for fairness, if this is the main carbohydrate being consumed.

As the worlds foods are becoming more accessible new qualities and characteristics will start to appear in people producing humans of outstanding quality, if they are uncontaminated and undistorted.

*****

2.12 – Soya or Soybeans

The picture above shows 2 100g boxes of soya mince. Each box contained 2 50g sachets.

In front of the boxes of soya are 2 clear, plastic bags each filled with 100g of soya and tied.

Under the soya bags are 2 putty filters.

24 AA batteries are shown in 2 plastic bags at the front with a roll of bags between.

Everything is the same as before except now soya is being used for its carbohydrate energy.

Method:

Only 1 bag of soya is needed for this not 2.

As before start on the lower back by placing the a putty filter on first with the bags of soya and batteries placed on top. Leave on for up to 2 hours, or until you judge the session's over.

Remove and store safely then in a day or 2 place the materials on lower back again and leave on for up to 2 hours.

Remove and store safely.

Soya is a soother reducing what may be seen as emotional and mental inflammation.

Emotions, feelings, behaviour and mental conditions can all be subject to becoming swollen, enlarged or inflamed such as anger becoming rage or fury; powerful desires dominating peoples' lives; behaviour becoming obsessive, mechanical and machine like and the sense of self swelling to the point where a person becomes delusional, to name a few.

The filtered energy of soya also helps reduce physical inflammation in the body, but should only be used after a Doctors or Physicians advice has been sought.

All these are soothed and the inflammation reduced by the filtered energy of soya allowing people to have a clearer, unpressured, undistorted view of life and situations.

*****

2.13 – Sugar

A picture of the materials used is below...

The last material used has been replaced with a 500g bag of sugar.

Also shown are 2 putty filters with 2 bags of white sugar, about 200g in each, sitting on top, a roll of plastic bags and 24 AA batteries divided into 2 plastic bags, all as before.

There's no particular reason for using white sugar. If you feel brown sugar would be better to use for yourself, please do so.

As before only 1 bag of sugar is needed not 2.

Method:

Place the materials on the lower back for up to 2 hours and then repeat next day or when ready.

Sugar is used for its carbohydrate energy. It connects and joins all the other sugar and carbohydrate energies used up to now. Joining them in this way acts to balance and keep them all in relationship to each other.

The filtered energy of sugar draws together all the different carbohydrate energies to form an overall energy which becomes a person's reality that is the feeling of their existence, and penetrates that reality with meaning.

Meaning gives reality, or the feeling of existence, its content from which purpose flows. This meaning will also infuse thought.

*****

If you wish to try any carbohydrate that's hasn't been shown in Part 2, please go ahead. Use the method the same as in Part 2 with batteries, putty filters and plastic bags placed on the lower back twice for up to 2 hours.

Thank you, Richard.

3 – Going Deeper

*****

Introduction

Much internal damage to the body's energy, energy systems and processes has to be dealt with before a person can proceed with deeper development which is the aim of Part 3.

We don't start from a neutral position, rather having to repair so much just to walk up to the starting line.

Due to this internal damage holding people back, the view has grown that people lack something in order to develop and progress, which opens the door to all the beliefs, systems, practices, methods and so on.

This is to misunderstand the situation and then apply inappropriate methods to resolve it.

The Therapy Part 3 holds the view that an individual is held back partly because the internal mechanisms and processes that promote energy development and therefore health, have been damaged or distorted by the consumption of petrochemicals in recent decades.

This has been going on long enough so everyone's affected, meaning we have nobody to compare the present human condition with to see the difference.

Once the internal mechanisms and processes have been restored, repaired and energised through the use of The Therapy, especially Part 3 which has this as a goal, and filtered food energy is absorbed by a body freed of contaminates, the flow of energy that promotes internal personal development and progress will resume and health will return.

The premise is simple: the energies of a cultures food will develop a person so long as those energies aren't interfered with, distorted or damaged and the energy processes and systems in a person function properly.

A lot of what creates us as a person is absorbed from food after birth, it's possible to repair and restore these energies from outside using The Therapy.

Carbohydrate supplies humans with basic, underlying attributes and characteristics, other foods supply the energies that go on top of these, supplying other human qualities.

Running parallel to this is the way blended energy develops life, especially human life looked at in Life and Sentience available from this site.

3.1 – Honey & Batteries

Introduction

Once the energy from the batteries and honey has been absorbed into the body by the immune system using the method described below, the brain will use that energy to fashion energy filters to help protect itself from inescapable, debilitating, pain that's the product of modern life.

After using this method a person will simply feel better, have more energy, look forward and open up to life.

Materials Used:

24 rechargeable AA batteries, the same ones that have been used throughout The Therapy.

2 small, or 1 large, putty filter in clear plastic bags, as used before.

1 bottle of honey. A liquid one has been used here for easy pouring. The one shown is 680grams, but 500grams, or about 1lb should be fine.

Please Note: Only bees honey should be used. This method has been developed using bees honey and it's not known if honey from other insects will work the same. Bees honey supplies the needed energy.

Clear plastic bags, again the ones that have been used throughout.

The honey is nothing special, any easily and cheaply obtained will be fine.

Method:

Divide the batteries in half into 2 clear plastic bags. Make sure the batteries are fully charged.

Pour the honey into 1 plastic bag. Two are shown but only 1 is used.

See the picture below...

The bags are placed on the lower back and any painful areas.

Palace the putty filters on the lower back with the bags of batteries and honey placed on top.

It may be easier and more comfortable to place the materials on a bed and rest the lower back on them.

Leave on for up to 2 hours, remove, recharge the batteries and store the materials safely away from children and pets.

After a few days or sooner use the putty filters, batteries and honey near any pain in the same way as on the lower back for 2 hours.

Leave on for up to 2 hours, remove, recharge the batteries and store the materials safely away from children and pets.

Repeat after a few days on the lower back for 2 hours, and then repeat again after a few days on any painful areas.

The times are for guidance. Extra sessions may be done on any painful areas being careful not to cut off the circulation or make the pain worse.

The filtered energy from the honey and batteries will be drawn into the body by the immune system starting after about 20 minutes once the immune system has perceived the energy of the honey and batteries and worked out what that energy can be used for and the best way to do it.

We are given much filtered energy from conception through the placenta, so the body is used to dealing with this kind of energy. What's new is that the body has now learnt, through watching how the putty filters work and how to fashion filters with this new energy itself.

The brain will now use this filter to screen out pain and painful feelings and memories as it sees fit. It will be interesting for the individual to see what is screened out and what's retained and also note, after a few months, how much you have changed in yourself.

3.2 – Batteries & Walnut Oil

Introduction

This part is about helping the ordering of the functioning of the mind by the brain.

Walnut oil was used and touched upon in The Therapy Part 2 briefly, here its being used in a more powerful way.

You will need:

The materials used are more or less the same as has been used before with the addition of walnut oil.

The picture above shows:

1 - 250ml bottle of walnut oil divided into 2 clear plastic bags and knotted.

1 bag of walnut oil is enough for this so just use 125ml or thereabouts.

24 - AA rechargeable batteries.

2 putty filters in plastic bags.

Clear, thin plastic bags.

Method:

The point here is to provide the body with walnut oil energy which the brain can access for the mind to use.

The bags will be placed on the lower back for up to 2 hours for 3 to 5 sessions in total.

Recharge the batteries after each session.

Start on the lower back placing the putty filters with a bag of walnut oil and batteries on top of each.

Leave on for up to 2 hours, remove, store safely away from pets and children and recharge the batteries.

Repeat twice more or do more sessions if you wish.

The energy will be held and stored in the body where the brain can access and use it as required.

4 – Cells

4.1 – Clearing & Energising Cell Membranes.

This method is to help a certain type of an illness which all fall into the same energy group and include some types of epilepsy, learning difficulties, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, migraine and cancer and originate primarily from the cell membrane.

Whatever the problem though proper medical help must be sought first.

Materials needed:

Rechargeable AA Batteries.

24 - 1.2V/2450mAh is used here. Non-rechargeable can be used but it will be expensive over time. It's ok to use AA batteries that have slightly different values if that's what's available, it doesn't have to be exact.

150 grams of graphite powder. This was bought in 3 x 50 gram containers and placed into 3 separate bags shown below in the picture.

1 - large putty filter which is just glazing putty, made from chalk and linseed oil, rolled flat and placed in a thin, clear plastic bag. The size is about 300mm x 300mm or 1 ft x 1 ft.

Except for the graphite powder you will have these materials from previous uses of The Therapy.

See the picture below:

Preparation:

As before charge the batteries and place 8 in 1 clear plastic bag, 8 in another and the last 8 in a third bag.

Pour 1 - 50gram container of graphite powder into 1 clear plastic bag. Do this for all 3 so you have 3 bags containing 50grams of graphite powder each. Knot the bag.

Method:

The putty filter is always placed next to the skin with the graphite powder and batteries placed on top so the power of these materials always has to pass through the putty filter before entering the body. Each session lasts for up to 2 hours.

The materials are placed on the lower back and the inside the forearms.

Place putty filters on the lower back and the inside of each forearm the same as The Therapy Part 1.1 and place 1 bag of batteries and graphite powder on each putty filter.

Leave on for 2 hours, remove recharge the batteries and store safely.

When ready repeat on the lower back and forearms a second time for 2 hours then when ready repeat again for a 3rd time so each area of the body is covered 3 times.

This should be enough but do more if you feel it's needed.

Having worked through all the other methods previously it should be fairly straight forward by now.

This puts in place the energy pathways for harmful energy from the cell membranes to pass along leading to the surface of the body and out which will begin once the new pathways are in place.

The membranes around the brain cells can also be holding painful memories which will start to move along the new pathways. These memories are another expression of the harmful energy stored in cell membranes.

This movement could lead to sudden flashes of bad memories or reliving painful situations from the past, but don't worry, it's just painful memories, feelings and experiences leaving and it will soon pass.

The action of the graphite powder clearing the cell membranes will help them return to a more natural state.

The natural energy state of living cells is to store the suns energy, pure and uncontaminated giving the body a robust condition.

*****

Once the cell membranes have been cleared the next step is to offer energy to the cell membranes mainly from oils strengthened by batteries. The vitamins support the energy of the oils and batteries and make them more acceptable to the cell membranes.

Boosting the energy content in the cell membrane in this way will help restart human development directing it in a way appropriate for humans and help remove certain diseases and disorders.

Also with the energy content of the cell membrane becoming full they will be more robust and able to withstand becoming infected or contaminated by harmful energies again.

These processes in the cells and cell membranes are development, not evolution which is a different process.

Changing the energy content of the cell membrane is beneficial for the individual during their lifetime and over generations and the change and direction it takes is entirely down to the cell membrane.

Materials needed:

Oils - about 90 omega 3 & 6 in capsule form are good, or olive oil, again in capsules if possible as its less messy if the bags leak. Use in liquid form if capsules are too expensive or not available. These have been used before in The Therapy.

Another good oil option is linseed oil especially if you have some left over from before, or use different oils at once it's your choice.

Vitamins - a pot of 90 good quality vitamins, used before as well. If you have vitamins & minerals there ok to use.

Batteries - the same 24 rechargeable ones used before.

Clear, plastic bags - the type used before.

Putty filters - as used before.

The picture above shows...

2 bags of oils & vitamins. Half your supply in each bag.

2 bags of rechargeable batteries 12 in each bag.

1 large putty filter.

1 roll of clear, thin plastic bags.

Method...

Start to use this about a week or 2 after the last session using the graphite powder to give it time to clear the cell membranes.

This method is identical as for using the graphite powder.

The area to cover is the lower back.

Each session lasts up to 2 hours 3 to 5 times in total. Do more sessions if you feel you need them.

Batteries are recharged between sessions and all materials are kept safely away from children and pets.

Leave a day or 2 between sessions.

Start by covering the lower back with the putty filter against the skin with the bags of oils, vitamins and batteries on top of the putty.

Leave on for up to 2 hours.

Remove, store safely and recharge the batteries.

Repeat again when ready on the lower back for 2 hours.

Then repeat a few days later so the lower back is covered 3 times in total.

Remove the materials and store safely.

Once the cells have been cleared and energised the next step is for a person to naturally align themselves with their immune system energy rather than to be overwhelmed, dominated and driven by the harmful emotions that arise from the cells such as hatred, anger, violence, fear and so on.

The individual's immune system energy gives a person direction in life based on seeing what is needed rather than being driven by unpleasant emotions, but before a person can align with their immune system energy, which will naturally happen, that energy needs to align with the new energy condition of their body brought about by using The Therapy.

And that comes next...

4.2 – Stimulants to Recalibrate the Immune System to the New Body Condition

Introduction

For this part of The Therapy strong tea & chocolate have been used.

4.2 is about the energy of the immune system and pairing that energy to the new energy condition that the body has gained through using The Therapy previously.

*****

Materials needed:

1 - box of extra strong tea, a box of 80 tea bags was used here. If extra strong tea is unavailable use the strongest you can find. The same for bags, use lose tea if bags are unavailable.

1 - bar of extra strong chocolate. The 1 used here is 90% cocoa, but use the strongest available.

24 - rechargeable batteries the same as always.

3 - putty filters, 2 small, for inside the forearms and 1 large for the lower back.

1 roll of thin, clear plastic bags.

As always no particular brand or product is recommended, just get the best quality you can at the best price.

See the photo below...

Picture shows:

1 box of tea with 40 bags in a plastic bag in front.

1 bar of chocolate with the chocolate in 2 halves in bags in front.

Batteries in 2 bags in the centre, 12 in each bag resting on a large putty filter.

2 small putty filters in the front with a roll of thin, clear plastic bags above.

The putty filters are, as always, in clear, thin plastic bags.

Method:

The areas of the body the materials are placed are the lower back and the inside of the forearms about half way between the wrist and elbow.

These areas and this way of using the materials have been used many times before.

The materials are placed on each area for up to 2 hours, 3 times for each, starting with the large putty filter on the lower back with the bags of batteries, tea and chocolate placed on top.

For the lower back use all the available materials. They are divided into 2 halves for the lower arms.

They are left on for up to 2 hours then removed, stored safely and the batteries recharged.

It's usually easier with the lower back to pace the materials in the correct order on a bed or chair and lie back on top of them.

Next is the inside of the forearms after a few days.

Rest the forearms on the small putty filters 1 for each arm with the materials under the putty filters.

The materials should be divided in half so each forearm is resting on 1 small putty filter with 1 thin, clear plastic bag containing 40 tea bags, or the lose equivalent, another bag containing half the chocolate bar and a 3rd bag containing 12 batteries.

Rest your arms on the materials for up to 2 hours then remove, store safely away from pets and children and recharge the batteries then when ready repeat on the lower back using the large putty filter and all the materials.

Leave on for 2 hours then a few days later use the materials on the forearms again, then finally a few days later the lower back and a few days after that the forearms.

Now the cell membranes have been cleared and energised and the immune system aligned with the new body condition the next step is to clear the genes in the cells of harmful weaker energy which is next...

*****

4.3 – Clearing the genes of harmful inherited energy and protecting them

Toxic, polluted energy drawn into the body is the acquired underlying condition that is a factor in so many modern illnesses such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.

This acquired energy resides in the body and the body systems and processes and much of this book has been devoted to getting rid of it, but another contributing factor to illness is the origin of human cells and the genes in those cells.

All life's inherited condition or inherited energy which we are born with, resides in the cells, and isn't in the body systems or processes.

The method here is concentrated and strong enough to clear the cells and genes and not be stopped by our immune systems as it wants all the energy it can get for development.

The Method...

You will need:

* 1- 500ml bottle of linseed oil - bottle at the back

* 8 - rechargeable AA batteries - the same as used in earlier methods - resting on the cotton wool

* some cotton wool - centre

* 4 - elastic bandages, each about 150mm to 200mm long, to hold the materials in place - on the left

* some clear thin plastic bags - top right

See picture below...

Preparation - see above...

* 4 of the clear, thin plastic bags will be needed.

* Take 1 bag and place a small handful of the cotton wool inside the bag.

* Pour some linseed oil into the bag, about 200/250mls, enough so the cotton wool soaks up the oil.

* Squeeze the air from the bag and knot it.

* Repeat with the other 3 bags so you have 4 bags in total with cotton wool soaked in linseed oil in each - on the right.

* Soaking the linseed oil in cotton wool spreads out the oils density allowing the body to draw in its energy.

* No putty filters are used with this method.

* Make sure the batteries are charged and you're ready to use it.

Next...

The materials are placed on the outside surfaces of the arms and legs, 1 bag on each.

Note this is the outside surface not the inside as used on the arms in earlier methods.

Start with the legs first. They need to be bare. Pull an elastic bandage over the foot and pull it up the leg so it covers the midpoint between ankle and knee.

Repeat on the other leg.

See picture below...

Now the arms which also need to be bare.

Pull an elastic bandage over the hand and pull it up the arm so it covers the midpoint between the wrist and elbow.

Now do the same on the other arm.

See picture below...

Starting with the legs take 1 of the plastic bags and push it inside the elastic bandage so it sits on the outside edge of the leg.

See pictures below...

Pushing the bags in...

The bags in position.

Then take 2 batteries and push them inside the bandage so they sit on the cotton wool.

Batteries in place. One leg done...

Repeat on the other leg.

Then do the same with the arms.

Bandage in place...

Push 1 of the plastic bags under the elastic bandage so it sits on top of the forearm...

Then push 2 batteries inside the bandage so they sit on top of the cotton wool...

Batteries in place. One arm done...

Repeat on the other arm.

Leave on for about 2 hours, then remove, recharge the batteries and repeat 2 or 3 days later, and again 2 to 3 days after that so you have done 3 sessions lasting about 2 hours each.

3 sessions should be enough to prime the process but do extra sessions if you feel it's needed.

A person's immune system sensing there's an energy it can use lets it through to clear the genes of harmful, non-human energy.

Any non-human energy in the genes can be harmful.

This is like each cell having its own local hard drive with a program on it acting independently of the body.

This is how it is for all non-human life making them specialised and fixed.

Once the genes are cleared of non-human energy the brain, working through the immune system, can take over with a touch so light the cells are, in effect, free of programming.

This is like it working from the cloud in computer terms.

After the removing of harmful non-human energy from the genes they gradually move away from having energy from different sources and move towards being fully human.

And these benefits are passed down to descendents.

*****

Next the cells and genes need to be protected.

The materials to do this are 24 - batteries, 1 large putty filter and some linseed oil in a plastic bag, knotted, without cotton wool just the oil about 1 small cupful.

The place to use this is the lower back with the putty on first with the batteries and linseed oil on top.

Leave on for 2 hours, remove, charge the batteries and store safely.

When ready repeat twice more for 2hours each so you do 3 sessions in total. Do more sessions if you wish.

Afterword

Well done!

You got to the end of The Therapy and hopefully achieved a lot of relief and development, and it has helped you move on in life.

More sessions may be used than what's shown mainly on the lower back. Flooding the body with energy gives it what it needs to put itself right, and like putting fuel in a car, energy gives the body health wise the ability to go the full distance.

The human body will use the energy received from The Therapy to put right as much as it can raising the general level of heath. Once done it will use any surplus energy to energise internal systems, the brain and mind and anywhere that needs energy. Health takes priority over development.

After health internal development starts to take place and some conditions and illnesses could be seen as a result of a falling back, or lowering of the internal energy state leading to a lower evolved state.

Q & A's

Please note: Whatever problem or condition you have please see your Doctor, Physician, Health Care Specialist and even Dentist, regarding problems with teeth, before using The Therapy. Thank you.

Q) Will it hurt?

A) No. You will feel no pain.

Q) Is it safe?

A) Yes. Safety is top priority with no side effects.

Q) Will I feel anything?

A) No. Very sensitive people may feel a slight tingling or warming of the hands and feet. It's very rare though.

Q) Will it deal with pain?

A) Possibly, depends what's causing it. Always seek medical advice regarding pain.

Q) Is it expensive?

A) No. The Therapy is given away free or sold at the lowest possible price such as minimum pricing on Amazon. It has to be a paid for book to get on Amazon, but its free to read on kindle. The ingredients are inexpensive and likely to be things you would buy anyway.

Q) Does it work?

A) Usually, depending on what the problem is, best to reserve judgement and try it and see for yourself. You will find out after using Part 1 a few times with the first aim to offer relief as soon as possible.

Q) How long does it take?

A) Using The Therapy can take many hours unfortunately so patience is called for. Keep going to get results. Once life supporting energy is in your body your immune system will take over using it for health, repair and strength in accordance with an undistorted body blueprint.

A person's body, using the supplied filtered energy from The Therapy restoring and working cell by cell, will carry on working over many years. Like a car with a full tank of fuel, a body full with energy will take a long journey.

A) Do you gain financially from it in any way?

Q) No. The Therapy itself will always be given away free or sold at the lowest possible price if it has to be sold to be seen. No shares or interest is held in any products.

Q) It's a bit unusual.

A) Yes it is. To try and restore health and strength using detergent, disinfectant, batteries, oils, earth and putty does look a bit unusual, but it's effective and once people start testing and evaluating The Therapy scientifically it will be more acceptable to people and become a parallel means to health.

Q) Is it a placebo effect?

A) No it uses real energy even if you can't feel it.

Q) Do I need Faith?

A) No just perseverance to keep going.

Q) Is religion or spiritually involved in any way?

A) No otherwise it wouldn't work on atheists.

Q) Has development of The Therapy finished?

A) No this book is hopefully the starting point for others and future generations. The study of energy in human beings is only just being explored and is vast.

Q) Have you had success with it in the past?

A) Yes much. There has been failure as well but that just means that the materials used didn't work on that particular condition, but The Therapy isn't just about illness but restoring strength and energy as well, so a lot can be done even for the incurable.

Q) What is the goal?

A) To end pain and suffering caused by illness leading on to the ending of all distortion in human beings allowing personal, internal development to restart. The question is always: what is causing the distortion in a person, and how to get rid of it?

Also to create a parallel development with more traditional methods which people can add to, understand and develop.

Q) How did you find out about it?

A) It had to be worked out from scratch. To do this some personal development's important, explained elsewhere in this book, as a perception of energy is needed to develop The Therapy, but if you just wish to use The Therapy as set out in this book, that's fine. Experience is the best teacher.

Much unnatural, congested energy could be seen in people who were ill, but how to draw it out?

Reading an old book on dealing with insect bites gave a direction, where a sodium solution was washed on the bite to neutralise it.

This was changed to using bags of sodium, (washing soda, soda crystals) placed on the ankles and wrists to draw out perceived dead energy associated with the bites. Then trying different types of sodium arriving at the detergent/disinfectant combination used now.

Then the process was reversed to introduce useful, life supporting energy. Sounds simple and it is, but it's taken over 25 years to work out.

Q) Can I read more about it, are you part of a group?

A) No there are no specific books, only this 1 and no specific groups to train in The Therapy, but starting something up, giving demonstrations, training and supervising people is always possible.

People who are drawn to this, who are fascinated by it, not just learning The Therapy, but wanting to help people in this way, are really half way there and would be very easy to teach. Not that much teaching is needed, if any.

Q) Are you a therapist doing this for a living?

A) No. This is my hobby with the aim of creating therapies people can use on themselves and others. The proof of it all is when it works and people experience this and the joy and wonder of it all as what's possible is seen.

Q) Would you object if others did it for a living?

A) Yes and No. Depends how it was done. The Therapy is designed for self use at home so why pay anybody to do it?

Q) What comes next?

A) More books. Once the basic methods been worked out it can be extended to help many other conditions.

Ok, thanks for reading this and please look out for the next version.

Regards & Good Health, Richard :)
