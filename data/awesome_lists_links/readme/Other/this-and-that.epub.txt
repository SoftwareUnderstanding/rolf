Rosie B: My first thought when they told me I had cancer was 'great, now I don't have to worry about flossing my teeth anymore'. My second thought was, 'why the fuck am I taking proper care of this cast iron skillet?'

Angel A: I had a locomotive once.

[SERIOUS]

Rosie B: The doctor told me that everything could turn out fine but there's no guarantee. Plan A will either work or it won't, he said, and if it doesn't, then Plan B, then Plan C, and Plans D, E and F and so on. Basically I'm going to spend the next years of my life sitting on my ass in hospitals waiting for doctors and technicians. I said cancer can only kill you, but cancer treatments will definitely ruin your life. I thought I was being funny, but I said it all serious and such. Nobody laughed anyway.

Karen A: Do you need a ride? Is there anything I can do? Anything at all?

Rosie B: And then I just wanted to drop everything, run away, and why not? George could easily carry on with the data analytics work solo. I've already taught him pretty much everything, and he might even prefer it to working for a "girl" (more than twice his age). He worries about his "career". Let him wait until he's near the end of the line to find out how much stress and anxiety he's been wasting all those years, because it does all come to an end and then it turns out to have been nothing all along. That's how it seems to me right now, remembering all the nights I stayed up struggling to get this or that project done, when the weight of the world seemed to be riding on it all. The bosses wanted their numbers, their projections, they wanted everything in the slides to be green, no reds, not even yellows even when a little caution is always warranted. Can you believe I spent all this time predicting the future based on "information"? Even harder to believe how damn good at it I am. But now. My sister's always there for me. Maybe she's been secretly waiting for this day so everyone can say look, it's Karen, that wannabe do-gooder is actually doing good for a change! But my friends, where did they go? Angel? Not a peep. Tony? Hello? So on the one hand I want to drop everything, and on the other hand it already feels like everything wants to drop me too.

[INFORMATIONS]

There is something called the Mind-Object Identity Theory which suggests that everything we are and everything we do are inextricably connected to and inseparable from everything we sense and experience from the so-called outside world. There is no self, no "I", just a lifelong complexity of action/reaction forming our lives. This makes a lot of sense to me. The neurons firing in my brain are not a "source of truth", they are part of the dance. What we like to think of as "free will" is us being who we are and doing what we do in the context of where we are and what is all around us existing and happening. Life consists of an increasing accumulation of what I like to call "waxy buildup".

What appears to be two dogs inspecting each other, sniffing each other's noses (ha! not what you expected is it?), and on closer inspection you notice that one of the dogs is not a dog but a fox, and the look in both their eyes suggests they are thinking, what the heck is this thing?

Angel A: So I read your [FUNNY] and agree, so cosmic! We go around acting like we're all going to live forever. But seriously, tell me about Plan A?

Rosie B: The last time I said "never" was never.

[NEWS]

Two ships collided in the dark off the coast of Liberia. This has happened many, many times over the past several centuries. Most of those ships and the people on board them remain completely unknown and lost to history. This time, however, the ships were called 'Funny Girl', and 'HR-XB7869P' and the people on the yacht were related to the president of Sierra Leone and all died. Those on the navy cruiser suffered only minor injuries.

[FUNNY]

George N: Two computers walked into a bar. It was a Foo bar.

[SERIOUS]

Rosie B: A lot of what we know about the Stone Age is based on stuff found in caves. I don't know about you, but most of the places I've been in the world there are no fucking caves. Never saw one in the Amazon. Never saw a decent one in the whole Midwest. Never saw one in all of Saskatchewan. Does that mean there was never any history in any of those places?

[WEATHER]

Partly cloudy with a chance of showers. Highs in the low to mid sixties. Winds out of the Southwest.

[SERIOUS]

Rosie B: So, Plan A is something kind of new called immunotherapy. Basically it weaponizes your immune system to fight the cancer cells. The cancer cells are tricky and latch on to something on these immune system T-cells to prevent them from knowing they are really bad guys. These new drugs kind of un-latch that connection, so the T-cells can see the cancer cells for that they are - trespassers who don't belong. There's some statistical chance it will work for me, and also some numerical odds about the side-effects and whether or not my body will take to it. My doctor is optimistic, but that's his job, so of course he is. In my job I would never be that assuring. I always tell my clients exactly what the data indicates. I guess there are way too many unknowns in this case.

Most experts believe that America was first populated by humans through the land bridge connecting Siberia to Alaska about thirteen thousand years ago. This theory completely neglects the fact that early humans were building boats and sailing the oceans long before that.

Rick A: Karen what did you mean by that? Of course God is smarter, He's smarter than anyone, and I think he knows what's in your heart so you don't have to worry. The church is always there for you, for both of us. We can work this out. I believe in us.

Karen A: Dear Rosslyn, why aren't you answering me? I know we've had our differences, not only of faith but also of course that thing with Jim. Will you ever find forgiveness in your heart? Know that Rick and I, and of course the girls, and THEIR girls TOO, have you uppermost in our thoughts and prayers. Please call me!

As political scandals go, this one seems to be a yawner. Don't you ever yearn for the days when we had genuine and massive corruption going on?

Three small children, ages four to six, are jumping on a trampoline. The trampoline is enclosed by a tall net all the way around. A man, probably the father of one or more of the children, is throwing brightly colored plastic balls as hard as he can in the direction of the children. Of course, all the balls are hitting the net and the children are in no danger of getting hit, but they don't seem to know it. They are only children. Or maybe they do know it and are only playing along, but every time he throws one they all flinch and jump out of the way. They are all laughing hysterically. This video has a two thousand to one likes versus dislikes ratio.

Rosie B: I'm calling it the drip factory, where I go to get the Plan A infusions. The nurses are all very nice, of course, and I'm lucky to have some good insurance of course. Plan A costs an incredible amount of money - something like twelve thousand dollars per session - and I have to go every three weeks for I don't know how long. I sit in a comfortable chair with an IV stuck in my arm, and I'm there for about a hour. They have televisions and chairs for guests. One old man had three guests sitting all around him. One of them was talking super loud (this was in the 'quiet room' of course) all about some problem she was having with a rooster.

Cancer is a pitiless life form that may or may not serve as the basis of all those alien invader allegories. It's growing there inside you and you don't even know it until one day there's a visible little lump that your friend notices and you didn't even because it's on your back, and you go to the doctor to have it removed, thinking it's nothing more than a cyst, a bit of fat and the doctor snips it out and then no worries. A few days later you're sitting in the cafeteria complaining to Marie about the stale bread that's your sandwich when the phone goes off and it's that doctor and she tells you, well? The autopsy, sorry, I mean the biopsy came back and yeah, what do you know, it's metastatic. Sorry.

Rosie B: So the side effects of Plan A are underway. Before I woke up this morning I felt my legs tingling but at the same time they felt heavy like fallen timber. I didn't know if I would be able to move. Then when I did stand up an overwhelming dizziness and I almost fell down. There's a fog in my brain like a, well, like a fucking fog! I'm not thinking that good. I saw a commercial for Plan A on the TV last night and can you believe their slogan is "you might even live"? What kind of a slogan is that? Angel keeps sending me links to these articles about successes and survival rates and she's come up with some hopeful anecdotal stories about people who have even lived, at least a couple of years which is only how long Plan A has been approved by the FDA. You don't read survivor stories written by people who did not survive. I keep seeing articles that the average life expectancy from what I have used to be only eight months a few years back but now with things like Plan A it's up to twenty four months and that is supposed to be awesome but to me it's either this year or next. That's what the numbers all come down to. Unless and except I turn out to be one of the lucky ones and then Plan A could mean five or even ten years, nobody even knows yet. I was going along thinking about retirement at sixty eight because let's face it I've been working since I was seventeen and I don't know any other way to live. Sixty eight still seemed like a lot of productive years ahead of me but now, all of a sudden, it's like will I even make it to sixty eight? The data analyst in me says the existing data says no, but it also says that's a small sample size, honey, and those people in those clinical trials were already dying and already tried a lot of those old user chemotherapies and radiations and such, so the sample is not only small but skewed and basically statistically worthless when it comes right down to it. So I'm left with "I might even live" and that is really all I know. Meanwhile I'm wondering where my brain has gone and my body just wants to lie down. I am so, so fucking tired all the time. I'm beginning to think I understand why zombies walk that way.

And how he never really gets tired or even seriously hurt but they all end up dead or lying around groaning all over the place? Of course we know it's never really like that in real life, where the bad things come at you all at once, and as good as you are at your skills they are going to kick your sorry ass all up and down the street.

We are not only conditioned by skin color but by specific facial features as well. A man can be as black as pigmentation goes but everybody seems to be able unconsciously to determine if he's truly what we call "a black man" or just some guy from maybe Bangladesh or wherever and in the former case it's watch out! and in the latter case don't worry about it. It's been drilled so deep down into our skulls that we can't even root it out, that shit is in there and it's staying put. Sometimes you want to rip those parts of your being right out of your soul but you can't.

Angel, get this. George is actually telling people that I asked him for that dick pic. He's saying I kept on him about it for weeks, teasing him about the size of his member and demanding proof. He says I told him to take his pants off in the office so I could see for myself. He says I told him I just wanted to see it, that I didn't want to touch it, but that maybe, depending, I would. And maybe even, no, I can't even write that down in words. He's claiming that he has witnesses who will back him up but the HR woman wouldn't tell me who that was. She says there may be depositions. She's saying he might take it to court unless. Unless means they want me to admit to everything. It would make their lives so much easier. But they will pay for my legal counsel if that is what I want. You bet that's what I want. I told them straight up he's a liar, and they should move him out to that stupid beepers thing not me. I have seniority after all. Everything he knows is what I taught him. Can you believe this shit? She said it's already decided and it's beepers or nothing and it's totally up to me. Right.

I don't know where it went! I'm sitting here in the cafeteria now where they are playing groovy light jazz and all I can think about is whether I should have another cup of coffee. My legs are like lead and my knees hurt. My stomach doesn't feel so good which is why probably not even more caffeine, but how to kick-start the brain otherwise? My to-do list is mostly checked off. There are some new datasets coming in which need a thorough scrubbing but am I supposed to care? I want to go home and sleep but there are meetings later on and I'm supposed to have lunch with my boss's boss's boss. What could possible go wrong with that?

They almost never serve pizza in the cafeteria - usually it's something to do with quinoa or kale or other things you never heard of until a couple of months ago - but when they do, everybody comes running. And I was in a booth by myself without any food on the table and I was getting looks, boy was I ever. Either I fell asleep or what I don't know. Anyway, I made it back to my desk which was finally lonely for a bit and I think I might have done some work. I have vague memories of typing in the words 'git commit'. It seemed like a long time but it was still not even one when I suddenly remembered I was supposed to have lunch with somebody, I forget who. It's on my calendar so I could check if I want to but the thing is, the afternoon somehow went by and I don't even remember it. I've been so tired. I must have driven home the usual way with the usual traffic on the freeway and everything, but I couldn't swear on it. Yet here I am and Chingachgook is not here. Where could he be? It's only a one-bedroom on the twentieth floor and I have checked in all two of the rooms and the kitchen and in the closets and even the cabinets. I don't think anyone else has been in here today, and I think he was here when I left to go to work in the morning. It's all becoming a blur. That cat has not set a foot outside this apartment in over a year. He doesn't even go anywhere near the front door. And the balcony door is closed too, and I looked out there. I don't know what to do, or what to think. All I know at this moment is I just got another fucking email from work.

It has recently come to our attention that the male of the species sometimes has difficulty initiating, let alone sustaining, a conversation with any other member of the species regardless of gender. New research from the University of the Tri State Area has determined that these males display frequent aphasia at all times of day and at all times of the year. This has led to speculation that conversation is not particularly their strong suit.

A nominally anonymous survey conducted among employees at AllDat Corporation has revealed a tremendous amount of hostility both towards the company itself as well as specific individuals within it. A high rate of employees express dissatisfaction both with their managers and with their working conditions. It appears that the gourmet meals offered completely gratis in the brand new cafeterias is greeted with derision and contempt among the spoiled brats who constitute the bulk of the institution's employees. This sneering attitude is especially common in the engineering departments. Also of interest, there seems to be an unusually high level of gender role confusion, in the sense that there exist the misleading and erroneous concept that there even ARE different roles for different genders in the workplace.

I can feel this darkness coming over my mind. It reminds me of the days after the doctor told me I could never have a child, or the weeks after Jim and I were chased by that white Christian mob down in Birmingham. I just want to hide. At home I don't even feel like weaving - the loom is just staring at me from the corner of the kitchen, and the last thing I want to do is pick up the clarinet. I look at the case and wonder just who the hell I am these days. But into the office I go, every day, and I even had a decent idea at five in the morning on Tuesday. I sent it off to the boss and the boss's boss and the boss's boss's boss, and even Dillon Sharif jumped on the reply-all. I suggested it could be a 'machine language'. We all know that some of those little 'smart' things they've been manufacturing these days have started 'talking' to each other but no one has heard it out loud yet. So maybe that's what it is, the beepings I mean. Some kind of new machine language.

I pretty much slept through the PET scan yesterday. Like everything else in this whole process ("fighting" cancer == waiting in places you'd rather not be), there were a lot of obvious questions that have to asked every single time (what's your name? what's your birth date? what's your phone number? what's your insurance? what's your address? what medications are you taking? what are you allergic to? who do you love?), followed by needles either putting stuff in or taking stuff out, followed by more waiting, then changing into a robe, then being led to a room with a giant white tube in the middle of it, and lying down on a tray with your arms strapped to your side, then pulled in and out of the tube on the tray while the technician in his little room talks to you every now and then to let you know this isn't a permanent situation and you haven't yet lost all your marbles.

He already got with Harriet and tried and failed with MacKenzie and he's working on Marie (who can't stand him) and he's convinced Roman that getting you in trouble for harassment counts. It already counts and he doesn't even give a shit. I got this all from Harriet's buddy Aspen, who I met just hanging out near Harriet's office scoping her out. Aspen is a talker! Also the guys are arguing whether just getting the dick pic sent to MacKenzie should count. Roman says no because he could just send it to six random women in the company but George is all, no, it has to be safe "targets" so he doesn't get in real trouble. He got Harriet to hack the phony emails. She's a real piece of work according to her friend. Works in accounting but loves to hack. Thinks she ought to be a data scientist but Dillon has something against her. Paranoid much? Everybody knows that Dillon doesn't notice anyone. Aspen thinks that Harriet would make a hell of an embezzler if she set her mind to it, and they do both want to go on an Alaska cruise sometime.

He does not know anything about AllDat. He doesn't even know who Dillon Sharif is. I thought everybody knew! He's more famous even than Steve fucking Jobs, at least I thought he was. He interrupted me and told me that if I wanted to see another doctor I could go right ahead, but as long as he is my doctor I am to do what he tells me to do. Plan B is a combination of two drugs - one of which is largely ineffective by itself but when used with the other it makes the other better, or something like that. They all seem to have similar names, ending in "zumab", which means "humanized antibodies", which sounds pretty freaky to me.

You cannot separate a current event from the long trail of history preceding it. Once again we witness this snowball effect in the situation in El Salvador. The United States has a long history of meddling in the internal affairs of this and neighboring countries, including but not limited to outright military invasions and coups.

Even though the prisoner Vasquez would seem to be an innocent victim, the population as a whole has risen to defend its sovereignty against its tyrannical neighbor to the north.

I lost two or three days this week - I'm still not quite sure - and I don't miss them anymore than I miss all the other days that are now lost and gone forever. I might as well have lived my regular life those days. I might as well have got in my car and driven the freeway and sat at my desk and prepared my reports and presented my findings in one meeting after another and reviewed the conclusions and considered all the takeaways and accepted the action items and jotted down notes and set myself up for the next day when I would have done the same things all over once again. Instead I spent those days in a hospital bed and I'm told that I slept through most of it. I'm told they weren't even sure if I was going to regain consciousness or not. I'm told they shipped me downstairs for MRIs and CT scans and that the results are still pending. I still don't know what happened. What I do know is that they sent me home, because my insurance is gone and I have to sign up for extended coverage, not even the Premium Cobra anymore because they took that away from me too. So I am sitting here at home, at the little wooden table in my kitchen, in my favorite half-wicker chair, and typing away with my thoughts, and it might as well be tomorrow and the time I am occupying at this moment doesn't even exist as soon as it does. The same will be true of however much time I have left, however many days that turns out to be. What do I want to do with the rest of my life? Is it okay if I say 'nothing. nothing at all'?

Men were always nice to her and even now, even pushing sixty she still gets the looks, gets the deference, gets the "royal treatment" like the manager of the Golden Dough. In the old days it was always Angel drawing the crowds, though it was both of us in those skimpy outfits shaking our stuff because Cumbia, you know, especially back then when every record album had a nude girl on the cover. And the men would never believe that she was gay, they thought she was only saying that to fend them off, and maybe at first she was! Who knows what you are when you're only twenty two and out there on the road soaking up experience. Angel loved the life, and she was always in the lead, with her big hair and big trombone and big, well, everything where it counted. I was okay-looking and good enough but Angel, anyway, let's just say she could usually put the men where she wanted them, probably this Agent Harold Stash too. He was not at all very nice to me. Accused me of "playing the C card" when he came to my apartment and demanded an immediate interview. I was barely awake and in my robe but he didn't care. I made him coffee and explained about my head, he didn't care He wanted to know about Alfredo, about Nacho, Rodolfo, a whole list of names from thirty, forty years ago. And when I started to answer he interrupted and said he didn't want stories, he wanted facts. I don't care about the night Ronaldo fell off the stage, he snapped at me, even though it was typical Ronaldo who was always drunk and unreliable and one of the main reasons we got out of it in the end and Angel let me drag us into the engineering program. We'll change our lives! I promised her, and we did. Does anything ever leave us, though, anything important? When I dream, I still dream of the show, of the life, of music and dancing and some guy trying to grab my ass. I never dream about computers or offices or anything like that. God, my head hurts.

They think it might have been laundered through some drug cartel or something. They mentioned a Pancho Sanza but I think they're just being lazy and making shit up. Clearly they meant Sancho Panza like right out of a book like a stupid code name like nobody knows who it is.

Rosie B: It's the everydayness of the thing sometimes. Like it's normal. Like the rest of the world is going about its daily business and you are too. You're standing there in that same spot waiting for the bureaucrat receptionist to wave you over so he can ask your name and birthday and all that stuff and tell you that you can have a seat and he's very nice, a very pleasant man who sometimes even remembers you and smiles. Then one of the nurses will call your name in a little while - the lab I go to now is much quicker than the other one was - and she (or he sometimes) is also usually friendly and more or less good at sticking the needle into your arm and drawing the six or seven multi-colored vials of blood, each of which is coded for its own inscrutable purpose. They know but you don't know. And then it's back to sitting and waiting again, at least an hour until you see the doctor, and when it was Dr. Abbas it was usually two hours because although the screen said he'd be right with you he would never be right with you. Sometimes he was waiting for the lab to process all that blood. Sometimes he was just with other patients, more important ones, dyinger ones. You look around the waiting room and judge everyone you see. This one looks already dead. That one with the mask and the cane and nothing but wrinkles from head to toe, you think she can't have long. Then there's a man who looks okay, he's got gray hair but otherwise probably not a day over fifty and what's he doing here, waiting in the same waiting room, and you try to compare him with yourself and wonder if he's got more cancer than you do, or if he's illegitimate. Illegitimate because he only has a little bit of it, and Plan A is going to knock that shit right out, and then he's going to be all right and maybe live a long, long time whereas these other people here, they have it more, they have it worse, and why him, why is he so fucking lucky? Finally they take you into the little waiting room (and it is very nice of Pepa to come in here with me, she knows she didn't have to but she is curious, I know. I understand) and do some more measurements like blood pressure and temperature and oxygen flow through your index finger and then more waiting, only now you're (usually) alone and just anticipating the knock on the door at any moment, and minutes pass, then half an hour or more. What are you going to do? You check your feed, that's what. You pull out your phone and check your feed and there it is, all of it going on and on like everything is normal. Now it's that blondie again who was blown up in her car. I don't even give a shit. Then it's more craziness about Antonio. Who would have ever thought? Antonio? Shy, balding, pudgy little Tony? With two firecracker ex-wives and two firecracker daughters and that fiancÃ©e who's waiting for him down in Panama is probably a xerox of those other two, who were copies of the girls he hung with on the road, the girls he liked in college and no doubt in high school too, the mean, naughty girls who toyed with him like the good little boy he always was. My poor Antonio! And there's people with their jokes, and people with their lies, and people with their highlights and their lowlights, and the things they like and all the things they don't. Meanwhile you don't know what's going on right inside your own body. You have no idea what's in your blood, what's in your cells, or what the doctor's going to see or what he's going to share. I trusted Dr. Abbas because he was a doctor but now I don't even know. I'm sitting there in the new doctor's waiting room and I haven't even met him yet and I don't know. What's he going to tell me? Was it the Plan B that messed me up? Or maybe it would have happened anyway? Whatever it was that happened? How come nobody tells me what is really going on? And even if they did, would I even understand? Cells that have stuff in them like X, Y or Z and that's what makes them cancer. They could tell me anything and I would simply nod my head and say, okay but is it going to kill me tomorrow or not right away? It's all I really want to know. There will be more appointments, and more scans and maybe more infusions or some other kind of treatment. In the meantime, here I am, checking my stupid feeds again, and everything is normal and flowing on and on and on and on.

The story of This and That can gracefully and naturally end in one of two ways now, and either way the feed itself continues, on and on and on and on.

Does Rosie B, a.k.a. Rosslyn, a.k.a. Rosario Bolinas survive, and get to go on Plan C through Dr. Rubinzahl, and was Dillon Sharif correct in his assessment that Plan C could help prolong her life? Does she then get to work with Tony in his start-up and if so, does Angel join them? Or is Rosie B already dead from the cancer which has spread to her brain and caused a mass effect, shutting down both consciousness and breathing? I can't decide.

If Rosie lives, what about Pedro V, the jigsaw-puzzle-manufacturing guy from GreaterGreeter.com? Will he and Rosie ever hook up? He seemed like a decent sort. Will she ever reconcile with her adulterous sister Karen, and what did she mean by 'excalibur'?

If she dies there will be no ticket sales, no long lines waiting to see her in her demise.

Meanwhile, what becomes of the CandyKid-jacked rocket? Is Manhattan destroyed by a malware-infected nuclear-tipped missile launched in a fit of pique and impulse by a lunatic president of the United States?

Does George N ever get what's coming to him? Probably not.

Cancer kills. Cancer treatments can mess up your life. This is something I am learning for myself right now, every day, and is the reason I've been writing this particular story.
