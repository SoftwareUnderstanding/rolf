### Important Message From The Author, Jason Medley

This Book is brought to you by Jason Medley of Flipmyfirsthouse.com, which is dedicated to helping brand new and seasoned real estate investors grow their business.

After years of funding deals, consulting, and traveling the country to speak to large groups of investors, Jason Medley realized the biggest challenge investors faced was a continually changing housing market. This led Jason to tap into his network of top investors to create a private, results-oriented group of investors, aptly named:

### The Secret Six Figure Society Mastermind

This eBook is a verbatim transcript of an exclusive presentation from the **Secret Six Figure Society Mastermind.** This private mastermind consists of 37 of the nation's top real estate investors and educators. In addition to the private meetings, Jason Medley hosts exclusive webinar classes with other members of the "society" to share their tactics and strategies with other investors around the country.

### This presentation features Joe McCall being interviewed by Jason Medley:

Joe McCall from www.WholesalingLeaseOptions.com has been investing in real estate for over 5 years. His background and education is in Civil Engineering. Before he started working on his real estate investing business full-time, he had worked for several large engineering & construction companies all around the country.

Joe has tried nearly every type of investing strategy, but his favorite two have always been Wholesaling & Lease Options. When he got tired of spending over $3,000 a month in marketing for his wholesaling business, and throwing away so many leads from unmotivated sellers, he knew there had to be a better way. That's when he came across the special niche he calls "Wholesaling Lease Options".

As soon as Joe started implementing his simple, unique system, within 3 months his part-time income surpassed his full-time income. Needless to say, he quickly left his job and has never looked back. He's still only working 5-10 hours a week, and his virtual team consistently flips 2-4 lease options a month – all for him, in spite of him.

Joe is an expert at flipping properties remotely. Recently, Joe spent two months in Prague, Czech Republic, with his wife and four kids. Using his techniques, he was able to flip two lease options in the USA while he was in Prague.

### Intro- Living the Life

Jason Medley:

Good evening everybody. Welcome to another edition of The Six Figure Secret Society, it's Jason "The Money Man" Medley and we're going to rock the house tonight. I have a very exciting guest on the phone with us tonight, a buddy of mine named Joe McCall. This is just going to be a hard hitting, meat on the bone content call. Grab a pen and paper and saddle up. We're going to cover off on some really cool, dynamic stuff.

This call resulted from a conversation that Joe and I had about a week ago. He was saying, "You know, I've been gone for two months in the Czech Republic. I had my wife and my kids with me and I was still flipping properties over there."

Of course me, I was digging in and starting to get curious and just really started asking, "How are you doing this? Who's finding your leads? Who's calling those leads? Who's signing your documents? Who's going to see the houses? How are you doing all that when you're literally thousands and thousands of miles away?"

He started sharing with me how he was doing that. We're going to cover off on this stuff tonight. This is going to be a nitty-gritty call. Again, it's 100% content. Please, pay attention. Turn everything else off. I can assure you that you're going to learn more tonight than just real estate. This will empower you to actually start thinking about how to automate your life, or I should say remove yourself from things you don't want to do. I try to outsource and delegate everything.

If you want a laugh, I'll give you an example. If I don't want to do it, I don't need to do it, and I don't have to do it, I'm going to try to find somebody else to do it. That's the way I want you to start looking not only at your real estate business, but your life.

I haven't been to a grocery store in over five years. That's the honest truth. Occasionally, if my girlfriend drags me in there for some strange, odd reason, but I haven't been to the grocery store in five years. Why? Because I don't go.

I have a spreadsheet, I send over everything I want from the grocery on Thursday nights and I have some young lady who goes and gets it, cooks my food, brings it to me in Tupperware and drops it off at my house on Sunday. I only pay her $70.00 to do it all. Obviously, plus the cost of everything.

That's not the point. It's not about me and whether or not I go to the grocery. It's about learning to look at your life and look at your business in a way that you say, "You know what? I didn't get into business to be a slave. I got into business to have freedom." To have control of your time.

I want you to write this down because I'm hoping at the end of this call, this is going to resonate with you. Something that I have grabbed onto, and I actually got this from a book I read a few months back and it's called _The Millionaire Fast Lane_. The author of this book kept emphasizing that money is no longer your currency, it's your time. Time is your currency. The only reason you want money is to have control of your time, so time is your currency. Start thinking about that. When things get in your life that are trying to steer your time or they're not worthy of your time, get it out of your way.

Gang, I'm juiced up about this call. I want to introduce to you Joe McCall. He's a super good guy. He's actually coming to my next Six Figure Secret Society mastermind in San Diego in August. I'm very excited an honored to have him coming out. Without much further ado, I'm going to let you take it away, brother. Let's hammer it out.

Joe McCall:

Thank you, Jason. Feel free to interrupt me. You said this is a 100% content call. I have to correct you there. It's not. It's a 110% content call. I love these calls, actually. I was telling you before I got on what I was going to be talking about and I was going to be kind of telling my story and how I got started in real estate because that's what most people want when they want a content call.

You said, "No, no, no. Stop. We don't want to know your whole sob story of how you got into real estate. We want to know how you're doing deals, man."

I said, "Well, cool. I like talking about that." I had to redo all my slides, thank you very much. I was rushed to get them done. I love talking about the details of how I do these things. I use a lot of tools and resources to flip properties.

I love real estate, man. I've been flipping properties full time now for three years and my specialty is what I call wholesaling lease options. I wholesale anything I can get my hands on, but right now I think that in my experience the easiest deals to flip are lease options. Find a seller who can't sell their house and you tie it up on a lease option contract and then you wholesale that contract to a tenant buyer.

My experience is those are the easiest deals to outsource because you don't have to meet the sellers. I don't go see the sellers, I don't go meet them in their house. I don't take pictures, I don't shoot a video. The seller shows the house for me to my buyers. The seller emails me pictures, and then I have virtual assistants do my marketing and realtors who do the other marketing for the home itself.

Jason Medley:

Joe, let me spout something here real quickly. Gang listen, we'll have this as interactive as possible. If you want the opportunity to ask Joe questions, you're going to have to get off your voice over IP connection, which is very simple. On the right side of your screen under the audio tab on your control panel you'll just click "telephone" instead of "mic and speakers". A phone number will come up and you can call in.

The only way you can raise your hand, you click the little symbol that looks like a hand on the right hand side. The only way that you can get your question answered is you have to click that button, but you have to call in. Technology is not to the point where we can try to do this over voice over IP as far as taking your questions that way.

Please call in, click telephone. It will show you a phone number. Call in, ask questions. Let's get interactive. Let's get real. Let's get the real answers out there.

Sorry to break you up there, Joe.

Joe McCall:

My wife and I got married in 1998 while I was still in school. We went to Prague through a student exchange program. I wasn't in high school, I was in college. We went to Prague and fell in love with Europe. We were there for six months. We came back to the U.S., moved around quite a bit.

Now we have four kids. We've adopted all four of our kids. We love our kids. I'm the most blessed man in the world. We wanted to take them to Europe, but how can you take a family of four kids on a 12 hour flight to Prague for just a week or two? We asked ourselves, "Why don't we go for two months?"

We said, "Okay, why not?" We couldn't think of a good enough reason to say no, so we started planning on it. I started thinking, "You know what? Can you really travel all around the world with your family, flipping properties with only a laptop?"

I've heard of other guys talk about this stuff, but I've never met anybody who had actually done it. It's funny, since I've started doing this I've started meeting a bunch of people who have been doing it because I get calls, "Hey, I've done that before."

There's a guy, Justin Lee. I don't know if you know him, Jason. He's in Panama right now, flipping properties in San Diego. Anyway, I have friends who live in India flipping properties right now in Chicago, believe it or not so I said, "I want to do this."

I set off on a mission to flip properties while I'm traveling with my family of four kids. I can't tell you how many strange looks we got, but we got plenty of them in Prague, with our four kids, flipping properties. I'll show you in a minute where I was working mostly.

This presentation contains many slides and pictures to which the speaker is referring. As a Free Bonus and to make your reading experience easier you may follow along on the video by clicking here.

This is us. This was taken about three or four months ago in Prague. You see the Prague Castle behind there. It's the biggest castle in the world. There's also the Charles Bridge, which was built in the 1300s.

It's amazing to be in these buildings and to see these things that were built in the 1100s, 1300s when we didn't even know that there was a North American continent. There were still Indians running around, shooting buffalo and living in teepees. They were building these huge civilizations over in Europe. It blows me away thinking about it.

There we are in London at some castle, I forget what it's called. The London Bridge is right behind us.

We really wanted to get out into the country. We went to Ireland for about a week and saw lots of rivers and bridges and stone fences.

This is a barn that we stayed in. It's a converted barn that was built in the 1200s or something crazy like that. It was converted into a house.

That's my daughter at the beach.

We saw lots of these things everywhere. We saw tons of sheep. That's the ocean there in the background.

We loved Prague. I want to just show you guys. I was thinking as I was doing this, I'm wondering if anybody really believes me. You go into Facebook and the cool thing about Facebook and phones and technologies is you can take a picture from wherever you are and you use location services and the picture can tell where you are, and then when you upload the picture to Facebook it can tag you.

It's kind of spooky, but this is proof. Here we are in Prague right there with these pictures that I took from my phone, and Ireland. There's a place called The Dirty Duck, loved it, in London.

The other cool thing is I want to show you where I worked. Here's a Google map of Prague. Prague is a beautiful city. If you ever get a chance to go, you really should check it out. Here is the heart of Prague right here.

This is called Newtown right here, it's called Newtown if you can see that. This part of town was built in the 1600s. That's new for them.

We were living right down here on a street called Plaskus Street. If you take this little Google Streetmaps you can drive right past our street. It's absolutely amazing with this technology.

Here is our house, right up here. There are these tall, five story buildings and we rented a two bedroom, furnished apartment there.

Let me show you where I worked. It was about four or five blocks, there's a place right here called Café Savoy. This is where I spent most of my time working. They had the fastest internet from where I could find it.

Jason

Kind of like your Starbucks in the Czech Republic?

Joe McCall:

Yeah, but they don't have brewed coffee. You can only buy cappuccinos and espressos and stuff. That was where I worked.

I won't spend too much time walking through here, but the river is right over here and the famous castles and bridges are right over here.

There was another place I worked. If we have time at the end I'll show you some cool places. The public transportation is just incredible in Prague and we spent a lot of time traveling around the city, seeing a bunch of things.

I do want to show you one thing right here. This is the famous Charles Bridge that's really, really old. It's kind of the centerpiece of the whole city.

There was a playground right here. We would take our kids. There were tons of playgrounds and we'd always take our kids to these playgrounds. I would work about two to four hours a day, and the rest of the time it was scheduling it around naps. We would go walk around the city, see the touristy things and stuff like that.

Jason Medley:

You kind of grazed over that, Joe, but I just want to kind of make sure that everybody heard it. You said that you worked two to four hours a day. Not only is he doing it remotely, guys. He's doing it in 10 to 20 hours a week. I'll tell you this, I'll be very candid with you. I work about the same amount of time a week. That's being very straightforward and candid. I probably work around 20 hours a week consistently and routinely.

There are definitely times when I start new projects, I'm getting ready to start a new project where I'll burn it out for maybe the next 60 days. I might work from 11:00 until 8:00 or 9:00 for 60 days just to get some momentum to get the project off the ground, and then I'll go back to basically what I was doing, working around 20 hours a week.

The key is that starting to think – this is amazing that Joe was able to do this. This is more than just controlling your time. It's about a life experience. It's such an amazing way to spend time with your family. The point here is that we're going to get into the realities of how this is done. Joe is actually going to show you some of the tools that he uses, as well.

That's what we were talking about. I want to get nitty-gritty. I really want to show people how you're doing all this when you're that far away. How the heck do you flip houses when you're that far away? Everybody seems to be amused yet intimidated when somebody's telling them they can work anywhere in the world.

The bigger purpose of this call for me, gang, is not just to help you in your real estate business, not just to help you get off the ground, not just to help you grow it if you're already experienced, but to help you start thinking about getting rid of things you don't like to do, don't need to do, and don't have to do and let somebody else do it.

Joe McCall:

That's a good point. I talk about this a lot. I just write down everything that I do and I look at, "Okay, what am I good at? What am I not good at? What can I get somebody else to do?" I just outsource it.

I don't outsource my grocery shopping or my cooking. If you count my wife, maybe she does that for me.

Jason Medley:

It's a little harder to do when you have kids. I'm a single guy.

One thing, before we go any further. Gang, write this down. We're going to jump into the nitty-gritty of the call, but write that down. That phrase that I just shared with you is really the way that I started to improve my life from the perspective of having a lot of time. I wrote that phrase down and I put it on the top of a piece of paper. If I don't want to do it, I don't need to do it, and I don't have to do it, I'm not going to do it. Then I would just slowly start figuring out ways to delegate that or to get someone else to do it.

Write that phrase down. If I don't want to do it, I don't need to do it, and I don't have to do it – write that at the top of a piece of paper and on a daily basis just start putting things on there and take back control of your life.

Joe McCall:

Loron McGrann says, "The less I work, the more I make."

Jason Medley:

That's definitely the way it's been for me.

Joe McCall:

This is my second favorite coffee shop. There was Starbucks there, so I needed some brewed coffee and I was able to work at the Starbucks right here.

It's a cool place. You can see these old trams that are here, and that's an older one. They have a lot of newer ones, as well.

I could show you a bunch of pictures, but you guys are probably getting bored of the pictures.
Chapter 2

### Four Keys to Success

Joe McCall:

I believe that there are four keys to success in real estate that maybe could apply even to other businesses, as well. It's marketing, automation, delegation, and I added a fourth, sales – learning how to talk to sellers, learning what to say.

I'm going to spend all my time on the first three here about marketing, what kind of marketing I was doing. It's real important that you develop marketing systems so that they can be automated so that somebody else can do them. I say this over and over again – you're not in the real estate business, guys. You are in the marketing business. This is a marketing business through and through, and without leads your business is dead. You have to be an expert in marketing and understand marketing.

I learned this really early on because I had a full time job 60, 70 hours a week. The only time I could talk to sellers was on my lunch break or when I was driving home. I had to develop systems since I wanted to quit my job so badly of getting VAs to do my marketing for me. I even hired a friend on commission only to actually talk to sellers and I hired realtors to market my homes for me.

It worked. All of a sudden I started flipping these deals like lease options like I do mostly. Within three months of doing that, my part time income flipping these lease options surpassed my full time income. That was three years ago. That's when I left my job. I didn't even have any idea what I was going to be doing three years later, going to Prague for a couple of months. We're already talking about going to Costa Rica next spring. We're going to San Diego for a week or two weeks in August, next month, to see you, Jason. I'm bringing my family with me.

I'm going to Colorado a month after that for another vacation for the week. I'll be taking a lot of time off, but I'll still be working and my team will be running the stuff without me.
Chapter 3

### Marketing by the Numbers

Joe McCall:

I first want to talk about marketing by the numbers. It's important that you learn to break down your marketing into goals you can control. It's easy to say, "I want to make $100,000.00 a year." Or, "I want to do two deals a month." Can you really control that? I don't think you can. You need to break down your income goals. If you want to flip a certain number of deals, whatever your goals are, you need to break them down into something you can control so that you know, "If I want to do two deals a month or four deals a month, how many sellers do I need to talk to every day?"

That gets a little more down into what you need to have, but that's still hard to control. You need to break it down into, "How much marketing should I do every day or every week to talk to the number of sellers that I need to talk to, to get to the income goals that I have?"

I have a spreadsheet I want to review with you guys – and Jason can give it to everybody if you want on the list. Let me open up this spreadsheet here.

I'll try to zoom in here to make it as big as possible so everybody can see it. I just did this spreadsheet the other day. I was on a coaching call with some students and I said, "Let's say you want to make $120,000.00 a year." That just rounds it off to $10,000.00 a month. Let's be conservative. Let's say your average profit per deal is $4,000.00. You take four divided by 10 and that's about two and a half deals per month. Let's bump that up to three, let's say.

Now, let's be conservative again. Let's say you only sell half of the homes that you actually get under contract. I use what's called a flex option, so my options that I have on my houses are flexible. That's one of the reasons why I can do so many deals virtually is because it's so easy to sell to the seller. They can cancel my contract if they sell it or lease it before I do. They can cancel my agreement and they won't owe me anything. It's very easy to sell what I'm doing to sellers.

Here's my offer too, by the way. What do you need for your house? Okay, I'll get that for you. When you're doing a lease option, you just find out what the seller needs for the house, as long as they're willing to wait a few years for it. I get it under a lease option contract and I sell that lease option contract to my tenant buyer.

Jason Medley:

Let me say something real quickly. Because what you do wouldn't necessarily be called what's "in vogue" right now. It's not an REO, it's not a short sale, that kind of thing. It could certainly be a short sale, but the way you're structuring it is what's called a lease option. For those of you who aren't familiar with a lease option, don't get lost in the fact that you're not familiar.

Again, the goal of tonight, and we'll give you Joe's blog and you can go check him out and you can learn more about these options. I just don't want you to get like, "Oh, I don't know what lease options are so I'm going to bounce." Again, the goal of tonight is, just like look at this spreadsheet. This is how an intelligent, driven person thinks about their business. There's value in that and we're going to tell you how he does all this stuff from a virtual standpoint. There's going to be a lot to learn here even though you may not be familiar with lease options are.

Joe McCall:

Thanks for clarifying that because that's important. This spreadsheet will apply to no matter what kind of business you're doing, in my opinion. If you're doing marketing, if you're doing postcards, if you're doing Craigslist stuff, this really, really helps. I'll try to lay off on the lease option language that I use because really what I'm talking about can apply to pretty much any type of real estate investment that you're focused on.

Looking at the numbers, again you want to get goals and things that you can control. Let's say you only sell 50% of the houses you get under contract, or let's say you sell 75%. Let's break this up. I want to be conservative.

That means I need to get six houses under contract every month to make my income goals.

Let's say you have to talk to 25 sellers to get one house under contract. That's a good general rule of thumb. Maybe it's 20, maybe it's 30 but you can play with that number. Let's say it's 25 sellers you need to talk to, to get one house under contract. Remember, in real estate sometimes you have to dig through a lot of dirt to get to the gold. That means it's a numbers game, right? These are all numbers and the law of averages.

That means if you need to talk to 25 sellers, you need to get six houses under contract. Six times 25 is 150. You need to talk to 150 sellers a day. That's not cold calling 150 sellers a day off of Craigslist. That's 150 sellers that are responding to your postcards, to your letters, to your different Craigslist campaigns and marketing that you're doing. I'm going to be showing you the Craigslist marketing that I do so you can see that and start applying it tomorrow.

Jason Medley:

Another thing I want to point out real quick Joe is immediately when we're going through this, when I look at line item number 10 the first thing I'm thinking is, "I don't want to do that. I don't want to talk to 150 people a month." I hope that everybody on the line tonight is thinking the same way like, "That is not something I would want to do."

That's part of what we're showing you on the call. He's going to show you how he doesn't really do it. I want you to start having your brain thinking that way. Immediately when he's putting that number up there I'm like, "I don't want to do that. I don't want to talk to 150 people." I'm already asking myself, "How do I get out of that?" Go ahead, brother.

Joe McCall:

Thanks for clarifying that again. Keep on bringing those things up because I forget those kinds of details. When you're in this, sometimes it's hard for me to see it from an outsider's perspective.

You take 150 divided by 25 working days a month, let's say. That means you or your VA or somebody needs to talk to six sellers every day. Now we're getting down into a little more nitty-gritty. Let me be clear about this, too. While Jason and I don't want to talk to six sellers a day, for a newbie, for somebody who's just now beginning, I suggest that you do talk to six sellers a day and figure out how it works because that's really not a whole lot. That's an hour a day, maybe two hours a day talking to sellers. It is important that you learn how to do this stuff yourself so that you can train your assistants and people you hire under you – your realtors, your VAs, to do it for you. You'll train them what to say.

By the way, I'm going to be going over in a few minutes the scripts and the things that I give to my VAs to say to these sellers. I'm going to give you the questions that they ask. I'm even going to show you how they put the leads into our database and how we follow up with them and stuff like that.

In the progression of my business really what happened was I was doing all this myself and then I outsourced just a little bit at a time. I started outsourcing the Craigslist stuff to the VAs, then I had the VAs do postcards. Then I said, "VAs, I'm getting all these calls in the voicemail. I want you to call them back and just get their basic information." Then they started doing that.

Then I said, "Call them back and get their basic information and if they meet these criteria, then schedule an appointment for me to call them." They did that for a few months. Then all of a sudden I'm getting my calendar full of all these appointments. I said, "Wait a minute, stop. I want you to actually close them now. If they're ready to do a deal, send them my contract and get it signed." All of a sudden before I know it, my VAs are getting sellers to sign my contracts and they're sending them to me. I get them in an email and I send the email off to my realtor and she does the rest.

It's kind of a progression and sometimes I want to be careful that people don't get overwhelmed with, "Oh man, I have to have a VA to do my first deal," or whatnot. If you've already done some deals, this is kind of how it progresses. You can outsource everything, really.

Somebody has to talk to six sellers a day. Let's say 75% of your leads come from Craigslist. I'm going to show you how I do my Craigslist marketing here in a minute. Let's say 25% of your leads come from postcards.

You can change this to 50/50 if you want. I'm doing more direct mail now than I ever have. I'm doing more direct mail.

Now that means I need to get 75 leads per month from Craigslist and 75 leads per month from postcards. If you look at the average response rates here, Craigslist I'll just tell you, an average of 15% of the people that I send marketing to in Craigslist. This isn't putting an ad in Craigslist. This is me sending some marketing out to somebody who's advertising their house on Craigslist. I'll show you how I do that here in a minute.

I get an average of 15% response rate who say, "Yeah, maybe. Tell me more." With postcards I get about a 3% response rate and with yellow letters, about 8%. This is important. That means I need to send out 500 pieces of marketing to Craigslist every month, and I need to send 2,500 postcards every month.

If you look at the cost, there's zero cost in my Craigslist marketing. There's about $.46 per postcard.

In yellow, this is what's important. If you want to make $120,000.00 a year, you need to be sending out marketing to about 20 sellers and landlords every day on Craigslist. Five days a week, that's 100 leads in Craigslist. Somebody needs to go and find 20 different houses on Craigslist every day and send them something. The beautiful thing about marketing to Craigslist is that it's so easy to outsource and get somebody else to do.

You also need to send out 2,500 postcards per month to Craigslist, and that's about 625 postcards per week. I'm going to show you the postcards I use and how I train my VAs to send the postcards for me.

Jason Medley:

2,500 postcards off of Craigslist – are the addresses of the homes on Craigslist?

Joe McCall:

The postcards are coming from absentee owners that I'm getting from ListSource or RealQuest or something.

Jason Medley:

I gotcha.

Joe McCall:

The Craigslist, I don't have the ads. I'm just sending them text messages, emails, voice blasts, stuff like that.

Jason Medley:

Right, and that's what you were clarifying with me the other day. That's what I want everybody to know. Think about that. I always say it's better to be the hunted than the hunter. When you want to sell something or when you want somebody to do business with you, it's always better to be the hunted than the hunter.

A cool way that Joe's doing business, he's going to show you exactly how to do this and how he uses Google voice to do it. He sends text messages to the sellers on Craigslist. At that point it's kind of cold, but if they respond to him it becomes warm. It's not nearly as harsh or as fear driven as a cold call would be because you're only talking to the people who have interest.

Joe McCall:

Yeah, totally.

Jason Medley:

A lot of people have a fear of picking up the phone and actually having to have human interaction with other people. The cool thing about what you're doing, especially from a Craigslist perspective is you use technology to reach out to them and then that human interaction is made that much easier. You're only talking to the people who respond to you and who are motivated to talk to you.

Joe McCall:

Somebody put a question on here, "Is this a seminar or the Travel Channel?"

Jason Medley:

That's funny. I'll be frank. If you haven't gotten some value out of what we've covered so far, go back to watching _Desperate Housewives_ or something like that.

Joe McCall:

Go back to watching the Travel Channel. My favorite show right now is _House Hunters International._

The point of doing this is – you want to make $10,000.00 a month. So what, what does that mean? You need to break down your goals into things you can control. That is postcards per week. Let's say you don't want to do any Craigslist. You just change this to zero. Let's say postcards are 50% and yellow letters are 50%. Then you know, "I need to send out 2,500 postcards per month and 938 yellow letters per month, and it's going to cost me $2,000.00 to do that.

That is going to give you, based on the law of averages, your six sellers that you need to talk to or somebody needs to talk to every day. I did this because it's important. For developing the systems you need, you have to have marketing down so you understand that marketing is the most important part of this business. Once you figure out, "How much marketing do I need to do?" That's the first step in creating the systems in place to train someone else to do it all for you.

### Marketing on Auto-Pilot

Joe McCall:

Back to my PowerPoint, how much marketing should you do? This is the marketing that I do in Craigslist. I do what's called my 123 Punch and I'm going to show you right now what I'm looking for in Craigslist and I'm going to show you what my VAs do.

I'm just going to create a new spreadsheet here and I'm going to start copying and pasting just a couple of them so I can show you why I don't do this anymore.

I'm going to track in the spreadsheet the date, the title, the phone number, email, and link of these Craigslist ads.

This is what I used to do every day. I would go into Craigslist because I didn't have any money to spend on postcards. Nobody else I knew was doing this at the time. I'd go into Craigslist, I'd go into apartment/housing right here.

I'm in Craigslist For Rent and I use these things that are called positive and negative keywords. When you do a search in Craigslist, you have to have some kind of word that you're looking for.

Every ad has the word "Map" or "Location" in it, so I'm going to do "Map, Location".

I'm going to ad in negative keywords because I want to take out the ads that have words like "Realty, Broker, Apartment, Condo," and things like that. I'm going to do a negative "Realty, Realtor." This isn't going to take out every realtor's ad, but it's going to take out every ad that has the word "Realtor" in it. I'm also going to take out any apartment, I'm also taking out anything that has apartments with an "s", etcetera.

By the way, if you got lost in what I just did, in Craigslist go to Help and do a search for keywords and they'll show you how to search through ads and remove the ads that have certain words in them. Just go to help and figure it out.

Jason Medley:

Joe, when you just put that minus sign in there, does that signify that it's a negative keyword and you want to remove those words?

**Joe McCall:** Yeah.

Jason Medley:

Okay, I got you.

Joe McCall:

You don't have to do this. You could have your VA go through every single ad. Putting those negative keywords in removes about 50% of them right off the bat. I'm only looking for nice houses, so I'm looking for homes that have rents of over $1,000.00 a month.

I'm going to do minimum rent $1,000.00, I don't do a maximum. I only want three plus bedrooms.

I'm going to click search and I got 551 ads. What I do is I have this URL up here. All I'm going to do is just copy that URL and send it to my VA. You don't have to type in all this stuff, you just copy this URL and it already has your search parameters in that URL up there. I just copy that.

Here I have all these houses, so I'm just going to start going through them and looking for a house that I can send some marketing to. I actually like ads that don't have pictures in them. What I do is I used to do this every day.

I'd put in today's date, July 12.

I put the title of the ad and copy the title. Then I'd put the phone number, just copy and paste this stuff. If there was an email in there I'd copy it. Sometimes I copy this email. I copy the link for the ad itself right up there.

That's an ad I'm going to send some marketing to. I go back a page and I click the next one. I'm looking for houses that are not posted by realtors, that don't look like they're professional investors or property management companies.

Rentlinx, interesting. This is probably a realtor that has listed this property, so I'm just going to skip it and go to the next one. I'll just do two or three of these for you guys, all right?

### Get THEM To Call YOU

Jason Medley:

Guys, the point of what Joe is doing here is we're going to build through two or three of these. The point of what we're doing here is trying to show you how to create and then maximize and capitalize on a "list" and how to market to that list.

You are here listening to this edition of The Secret Six Figure Society right now because I have information about you. I've emailed you. A lot of you gave me your cell phones so I could text message you to remind you about the call. Basically what Joe is doing is he's harvesting sellers' data in a very similar way that I've done with you. He's getting their emails off of Craigslist, he's getting their phone numbers. Then what he's going to do is he's going to use very similar tools that I've used to get you on here with me tonight to communicate with these sellers.

It's super slick, and it's not rocket science. It's creative. It's a super slick concept in regard to what he's doing. The most intriguing thing about it for me is that he only ends up working with people who respond to him. They're going to invite him to communicate. If people don't respond, that's a lead he's not going to mess with. That's the thing that I think is coolest about it. It's kind of direct response marketing.

Joe McCall:

It is, and I'll show you what I send to these people in my voicemails and text messages and emails. It's really simple.

I go in and I look for 20 to 30 homes. I go through all of this until I find them.

This one doesn't have a phone number in it, so my VA has instructions on sending this person an email. She just clicks on this and sends them an email.

You're going to have 20 or 30 numbers in here and then you just check for duplicates. I have this formula in the spreadsheet I give to her and she can tell when she puts a phone number in here whether it's somebody that we contacted a week ago, two weeks ago. We remove the ones we've contacted before. Every day we're now only contacting the most unique sellers, homeowners, landlords, and things like that.

Now, if I were to show you the spreadsheet that we have, we have hundreds, maybe thousands of phone numbers and emails in there of landlords and sellers who have advertised homes before on Craigslist. Then what we do, and this is really cool and where I love systems is the first thing we do is we send them a text message.

We use Google Voice text messaging. It's free. Just go to Voice.Google.com.

You click "text" and you take one of these numbers, you copy it, go here, you paste the number in here.

By the way, you can paste up to five numbers at one time.

If I have five numbers here, I would copy all five, and I would paste them into this "To" field and it will send an individual text message to each of those five people.This is what I say. My VA just copies and pastes this every time. "Hi, my name is Joe. I saw your house on Craigslist." I only have 170-something characters available, but I'm at 103. "I was wondering if your house was available for..." and you can do whatever you want. Let's say you're just wanting to buy these houses and you're targeting "For Rent" ads. You could say, "I was wondering if your house was for sale?" If you're sending texts to FSBOs, for sale by owner, you could say, "I was wondering if your house was available for rent?" I like to say, "I was wondering if your house was available for lease purchase or rent to own?"

Jason Medley:

Joe, a quick question I have for you. I'm a little bit curious. I'm sitting here thinking five at a time and if you have a couple hundred of these it would be easier to use something like a club text or something. That obviously probably costs more. Am I thinking right when I would say that you're having a VA do it this way manually, say five at a time, simply because their time is so cheap that it's less expensive to do it this way?

Joe McCall:

Great question. I have four full time VAs right now. They work on my deal business and my teaching business, as well. If you look at the hourly wage when they're doing this deal stuff for me, I pay them about $1.50 to $2.00 an hour. I pay them about $500.00 per month.

Jason Medley:

What country are they in?

Joe McCall:

The Philippines.

Jason Medley:

So listen to that, guys. You have English speaking, very educated VAs out of the Philippines who are working for basically $1.50 to $2.00 an hour, so $500.00 a month for 40 hours a week.

Joe McCall:

Actually if you break it down, if they really are working 40 hours a week, $500.00 divided by 40 hours a week divided by 4.33 weeks in a month, it's $2.88 an hour.

Jason Medley:

The key point that I want everybody to understand is that is how you start to think about. We have such a global economy now. That's what I want you to start thinking about. That's one of the emails that I use to drive folks here. Instead of worrying about being fired and replaced by somebody who makes $3.00 an hour, you need to start thinking about how to use people who make $3.00 an hour to make your life easy.

Joe McCall:

One of my friends that I do a lot of business with had two full time jobs in California when he was there and he was hired by these companies to work for them. He just outsourced his jobs to VAs in the Philippines and he would surf. He was getting paid for two full time jobs and he outsourced everything to VAs.

Jason Medley:

He had a job and then he was getting paid a salary or an hourly rate by a company and then all of his admin stuff and so forth he would just outsource. That's cool, man.

Joe McCall:

These jobs were sales jobs, so he was getting a salary plus a commission and he was hiring the VAs to do all the marketing. He was training them how to do it and he would surf during the day.

One of his employers found out and got really ticked off, and then called the other employer and then he got fired. He lost both jobs. It was a good racket for six months or something.

You've heard the story of the four hour work week of the guy who was working in a big corporation. By the way, this friend of mine – I should say this just so you don't think he's a total dweeb. He was actually doing his job and doing very, very well. He made sure his VAs were doing what they were supposed to be doing and he was producing good results for the company. He wasn't stealing from the company, they just didn't appreciate that he wasn't the one doing the work since they paid him to do it.

I won't go into that story of the four hour work week. Just read it. There's a story in there of a guy who was working in Asia and his employer never knew about it.

Okay, so we were in Google Voice. There is a website I use sometimes called CallFire.com. CallFire.com allows you to send out mass text messages. The only problem is it doesn't let the people reply to your text messages.

I like Google Voice because you can see my inbox in here of different text messages. Most of these are voicemails. When a seller can reply to the text and it shows up like an email into Google Voice, then you can communicate to them through text message. Does that make sense, Jason?

Jason Medley:

Yeah, you can just open one of those and then just type and communicate back with them on your keyboard, like your computer keyboard is what you're saying.

Joe McCall:

Yeah, absolutely.

Jason Medley:

One thing I have a question for you, because I use Google Voice for voicemails and stuff like that but I've never used this text format. One of the things that I don't like about a CallFire or Club Texting is there are times when you want your text to look very real. If someone is giving you their phone number, at the end it will say, "To opt out, press X," and then you can tell it's not personalized. I would anticipate that on Google Voice they can't even tell that it's generated by the computer.

Joe McCall:

It comes from your Google Voice phone number, which is a local phone number. It's right there, you can see it.

Jason Medley:

Yeah, and it doesn't say anything as far as, "If you don't want this message, opt out." The power of what I'm saying here is that this really looks as if it came from Joe.

Joe McCall:

When I found this, I just fell in love with this technology because now I can have a VA send all these text messages for me. I would just come in every day and check to see if I got responses from them. If somebody responds, I can see their phone number from the response so I can call them up and see if they want to do a deal or not.

My message is real simple. "Hey, I saw your house on Craigslist. I was wondering if it was available for lease purchase or rent to own. If yes, call me." I still put my phone number in there. I don't have to because they can tell from the text message, but sometimes the phone number showing up in the text, they can just click on it and it will dial it. That's why I leave it in there, and that's it.

It sounds very personal. I'm not saying things like, "Hey, I can close in seven days. I can buy your house with cash. If you're interested, call me."

What you could do, and this is something I'm going to be starting to do soon here. This is something I'm real excited about. Right now I'm excluding all of the houses that are under three bedrooms and under $1,000.00 a month. There are a bunch of motivated landlords out there who want to sell their properties but can't and they're just advertising them for lease.

You could do a search for maximum rents of $800.00 and include everything and do a search. You might want to exclude apartments. I'll do Map, Location, and I'm going to exclude apartments. Let's do a search here.

I get a ton of them. Now I have 1,000. You can call all of these people up or send them text messages or voice blasts and say, "Hey, I saw your rental property on Craigslist. I'm an investor. I buy a bunch of homes. I was wondering if you would be interested in selling your property." Just send them a text and ask them if they would be interested in selling their property.

Here's one right here.

Joe McCall:

You know they're motivated because it's empty and they're advertising for tenants. You could send them messages asking if they want to sell their house. I'm targeting homes that are easy to wholesale real quickly, the cheaper properties.I was talking about Google Voice. Sometimes I'll do voice blasting and I will use CallFire to do voice blasting. I'm not going to spend much time on this because it can be a little grey area. I'm just going to tell you to use it at your own risk. I don't have a problem with it because on Craigslist these people are putting their phone numbers on Craigslist. They want you to call them if you're interested in leasing or buying their house. The grey area becomes can you use robo-calling to do that or not? I'll leave that up to you whether you are going to do that or not.

Jason Medley:

My favorite color is grey, Joe.

Joe McCall:

Here's the problem, though. If they call you and ask you what you're doing and if you don't explain it just right, I'm not talking about lying but they'll jump all over you. CallFire can get in trouble with the FTC if they're knowingly letting people abuse their system.

Enough of that. This is another cool website that I like, and this has been around for a long time. It's called Sly Dial. The cool thing about this, most of these numbers in Craigslist that you see here are most likely cell phones. What Sly Dial does is you dial this phone number first right here, you listen to a short little advertisement, this is completely free, and then if it's a cell phone it takes you directly to their voicemail. It won't make the phone ring or anything.

Again, because you don't want to do cold calls. Cold calls only work if somebody else is doing them, but even then still I would rather have my VAs do Sly Dial. I only want to talk to people who want to talk to me.

Jason Medley:

This is slick. Guys, before we got on the call I didn't have all the details. Joe and I had a conversation about what he was doing, I got some of the nitty-gritty, but I'm seeing a lot of this at the same time as you are.

What you're doing is you're getting the phone numbers out of Craigslist, your VAs are dialing 267-SLYDIAL and then they're actually entering the number of the person they're trying to call. When they leave a voicemail, it goes directly to their voicemail and their phone never actually rings?

Joe McCall:

Correct.

Jason Medley:

That's cool, dude. Again, that's where when we talk about it's always better to be the hunted than the hunter, you're only going to work with somebody who wants to call you back. That's what I love about how Joe has structured things.

Joe McCall:

Obviously, you have to have a VA who has decent English to do this. At the same time, I've had VAs do this for me that you can tell have an accent. It's really not that big of a deal. I don't even know if it has hurt my business. If a seller is motivated, they don't care. I do hire VAs who have very, very good English. You cannot tell they're from the Philippines. It's amazing. That's who I hire. You can find those guys, they're out there.

The message they leave is real simple. They call them up and say, "Hey, my name is Joe. I saw your house on Craigslist. I was just wondering if it was available for lease purchase or rent to own. If it is, call me at," and I give them my phone number, and then they repeat the phone number. That's it.

It goes to their voicemail. If the seller is interested in what I have to offer in lease purchasing or whatever, then they'll call me back. They could also say the same thing if it's a two bedroom house that's listed for rent. My VA could call and say, "Hey, my name is Joe. I'm an investor and I buy and lease properties. I saw your house on Craigslist and I was just wondering if you have any interest in selling it."

Or, they could call FSBO ads. You could call FSBO ads and say something like, "Hey, my name is Joe. I'm an investor. I saw your house on Craigslist. It looks like a house I'd be really interested in. I was wondering how negotiable you were with your price. If your price is at all negotiable, call me at," and it's a very friendly message.

The cool thing about voice blasting is I actually record the voicemail myself. I record the voicemail myself. My VA, every day they go into Craigslist and they copy these 20 to 30 phone numbers.

They just paste them right into CallFire, they upload them into the spreadsheet, they click a few buttons and they start to campaign. The system will automatically within like five seconds dial all 30 phone numbers. CallFire doesn't have a system where it goes right to their voicemail, but what it will do is if they pick up the phone and answer it live, it will play one message. If it goes to their voicemail it will play another message.

You can actually go in and pre record these messages with your own voice and then just give your VA your username and password to your CallFire account and they can login, upload the phone numbers, send out the voice blasts, and within a matter of minutes 50 people just got a call from you saying, "Hey, I saw your house on Craigslist. I was wondering if your price is at all negotiable. I'm an investor and I buy a bunch of..." and you can say whatever you say. Make it as personal as possible.

Depending on your strategy and how you're trying to get these houses, this is amazing. This is technology that you can do all of this stuff, your VA can do all of this stuff for you and it looks like it's coming from you.

Jason Medley:

The cool thing Joe is that I'm aware of all of this technology. I haven't seen Sly Dial before, but I'm aware of everything else that you've shown as far as CallFire and that kind of stuff and Google Voice. Sometimes it's the way in which you're using it that is revolutionary. This is some really cool stuff. I have a buddy of mine who buys cheap mobile homes for cash and he turns around and resells them and carries the paper for people. Maybe he buys it for $3,000.00 and turns around and sells it for $8,000.00 and he takes $1,000.00 down and he carries the remaining $7,000.00 that's due on the property and holds a note.

He just focuses on cash. I'm just sitting here thinking the strategy that you have shown me tonight, he could very easily use to sift and immediately pick out the mobile homes on Craigslist. He could use this technology to get the people calling him. My point in saying that gang is that no matter what kind of real estate you do, it doesn't have to be lease options, it doesn't have to be mobile homes. What Joe is showing you could be applicable to a lot of different types of niches on Craigslist. This is really cool stuff.

Joe McCall:

You know what you could do? I was reading some forum the other day and they were asking, "Can you buy cars subject to the existing car loan?" I was thinking about that.

If you wanted to, you could go into Craigslist, have your VA go into cars and trucks and do a search by owner only and do a search for all BMWs. There are 223 in here. You could have your VA go in and just copy and paste all these phone numbers. Then, send them voice blasts or Sly Dials or something and say, "Hey, I saw your car on Craigslist. I was wondering if you had a car you're trying to sell? I saw your Beemer. I was wondering if you would be open to selling it by letting me take over your loan payments," or something like that.

You could somehow phrase it where you can take over their car loan payments, if you had really bad credit for some reason and you wanted to buy this car right here. Certainly, you could just harvest these phone numbers, send them text messages and voice blasts and get a nice BMW without having to get your own loan or use your own credit. There are a lot of people out here wanting to sell their cars who would be glad to just let somebody take over their loan.

Jason Medley:

I have a few quick questions here, Joe. I have some folks, there's obviously somebody who's new on the line asking what a VA is. VA stands for virtual assistant. A virtual assistant basically means that's somebody who does not work in your office who is not your employee who is typically more often than not in a foreign country and they're English speaking but they work extremely cheap, typically for $1.00 to $3.00, $4.00, $5.00 an hour, all the way up to $50.00 an hour.

There are certainly some highly educated VAs who have probably been to school in America and have gone back home. They probably have degrees from some amazing universities. For what we're talking about tonight, VA stands for virtual assistant and it's typically someone who you can hire to do, for lack of a better term, mundane tasks that you don't want to do because, again, you want to have control of your life and have freedom. That means being in control of your time.

One other question that somebody is asking is how do you know when you pull these numbers if they're landlines? If they're landlines, you won't get to reach the people. Gang, whoever sent that message, please don't take this the wrong way because I'm not in any way trying to be ugly. Thinking like that is one of the ways that inhibits people sometimes from making progress or from growing. It's just a numbers game.

If you pull 100 numbers and most people put their cell phone in, hardly anybody uses a land line anymore, and 20 of them are land lines, only 80% of your text blasts were successful. Let it ride. It is what it is. Don't think about things that are little road blocks like that. Only focus on what's working rather than what's not working. That 20% is just not worth trying to figure that out.

Joe McCall:

Yeah, good point.

One other thing – I use Google Docs a lot. Now it's called Google Drive. The great thing about Google Docs is it's not like you upload a spreadsheet to some cloud server and then your VA downloads it and works on it and then re-uploads it so you can get the most current version that way. What Google Docs does is it lets you create spreadsheets that your VAs can update real time and you can see the results.

My VAs right now are researching different HUD properties in California and Missouri. Also, there's a website in Missouri where you can actually go in and get probate lists and evictions and divorces and things like that. Every day she goes in and looks in the court records and pulls up information in here from probates.

Many times there are addresses in here of the heirs or the executors of the estates. I have hundreds in here.

Every day she goes into the evictions. She can find out the names of landlords who have evicted tenants recently. Right here I can look up the name of the landlord, and then she pulls up the addresses of those landlords and their offices. I can send them letters and postcards asking if they have any properties they want to sell.

She does that all in Google Docs and then takes it from there. It's pretty amazing. Google Docs is another tool I use a lot of.

Here, by the way, is a spreadsheet. I have been updating this with one of my buddies in Phoenix since June of 2011. There are a gazillion number of leads in here. All it is, is the date, here's the phone number, we paste the phone numbers. My VAs make sure the format of the phone number is exactly the same every time.

These two blue columns will check to see if there are duplicates and they'll also keep track of the ads. They keep track of the CallFire status if it's an answering machine or leave a message. They also will keep track of whether they sent them a CallFire, a text message, or an email. They'll keep track of all this stuff.

It's pretty amazing. This is all updated in real time.

Jason Medley:

Joe, quick question. What company do you go through to get your VAs?

**Joe McCall:** I have a slide for that.
Chapter 6

### Tracking Hot Leads

Joe McCall:

I also use FreedomSoft a lot and let me just show you real quickly what that looks like. A seller calls in, they leave a message, they say, "Hey, I got your text. Yeah, I might consider selling my house or I might consider doing a lease purchase."

I have my VAs then actually go into my FreedomSoft account and there are other tools out there that I like that are good. FreedomSoft is the one I like the best.

They're going to put the person's name, Jim Smith Test. They're going to put in their address, 719 Falcon Hill Trail. They're going to save that lead in there. They're going to call the seller back and ask them some questions. I'm going to give you the questions here in a minute.

The cool thing about FreedomSoft is it's a great way to track the leads and assign them to groups and rank the leads by how hot they are and color code it and stuff. You can track the type of deal this is. It's going to be a lease option, let's say it's a new. You can put their email in here, test@hotmail.com. You can track the source of these leads and you can ask questions.

You can change these things around to ask them different questions. Why are they selling? Does it need any repairs? What do they need to sell it? What's their asking price? What's their lowest acceptable, etcetera.

The reason I'm showing you all this is because they put this information in, they put in their notes of the conversation right in here, and let's say the seller says, "You know what? I am interested in doing a lease purchase." I'm going to save changes here and they say, "I'm interested. Send me some more information." Now I just saved this and you can see right next to the email here is a little envelope.

My VA does this and they open up a bunch of different email templates and they can select who it's coming from and I can click right here, Email Templates and I have an email template called Lease Option.

Let's do this one. It inserts their name and says, "Hey, it was nice talking to you about doing the lease purchase on your house." It inserts the property address. I give a brief summary of how my lease purchase program works and it lists six or seven benefits. "We look forward to talking to you," and it gives the phone number, fax number, and all that stuff. They click "Send Email" and it sends that seller an email.

Then, you can track down below here the communication log, when the email was sent and things like that. Sometimes what I do – I don't do this as much as another friend I have – you can attach things on here. I have my VAs record all of their calls in Skype. You could have the VA then attach the phone call that he or she had with the seller and attach it to this lead. Then, you can go in and assign different tasks.

Let's say you want to assign a task to follow up with this seller in two days. You just say, "Follow up with seller," and you can give it a due date. You save it and close it. On the 17th, whoever is in FreedomSoft or I'll get an email, a little pop-up, "Hey, follow up with this seller." You click on the button and it takes you right to the lead and you can see the email that you sent and you can call them back and follow up.

It's really important when you're doing a bunch of this marketing to track your leads and where they come from.

You can even go in and get street views and stuff like that for some of these homes. That's one of my rental properties.

Whether it's FreedomSoft or whatever, you have to have a way to track and follow up with your sellers.

My VAs do all of this for me and they track all these leads for me in FreedomSoft. I can get online, go into my FreedomSoft account, see all of the hot leads that we have, and I can go and look at the notes, make sure my VAs are following up with them, making sure they're sending the information. If we sent a contract, we know that we've sent a contract and that we can follow up.

### Sign On The Dotted Line

Joe McCall:

Another tool that I use a lot is DocuSign. It used to be that DocuSign was the only thing out there that did this. Now there are several other tools. DocuSign is a website where you can sign things electronically. I won't spend much time going into this, but you can try it for free. I think it you can use it for free as many times as you want to, maybe.

I'm just going to login to my account really quickly and show you. If I click "Manage" I can send contracts to my sellers. Let me show you a recent one we had right here. I know this person.

On July 10th the seller filled out this contract. She puts in their information on the property, some description about the property, they tell me what they want to sell it for, what they want in rent, and the sign it electronically right here. Here's my one page option agreement. They signed my option agreement right there and then I get it in an email. "Hey, you have this document that's been signed and ready to go."

You could also send something to somebody. I'm going to create right now something here. I'm going to attach a file from my computer. Here's an assignment of agreement right here. I have a seller on the phone who wants to do a deal. I say, "Okay, I'm going to send you an agreement here." I'm going to put in their email address, test@hotmail.com, Joe Smith. Click "Add Signer". I'm going to say, "Hey, sign this. Thank you."

Then there are different things you can do. Click "Next" and it's going to bring up the document in here and you can drag where you want them to fill it out.

Then, you would say you want their name to go right here and you want the date to go right here. This is a data field but they have to actually type something in so you create a field that they type in. Here's another data field for the property address. You can make it required or not. I'm not going to make that required.

Then, you scroll down to where you want them to sign. Put the date signed right there and then you drag their signature right there and then you drag the other person's because you have multiple people sign this. Then, you just click "Send". Bam, the seller gets your contract. They open the email, they fill in these fields, and then they click "Sign Here" and it signs it.

You can set up different security measures to make sure it's the right person signing it. I won't go into those details, but it's pretty amazing. It will ask them for the last four digits of their social security number and it'll ask for their birth date, then it will ask them a series of five or six multiple choice questions that only they would know. Things like, "Where were your parents born? What was your first car loan? What is the bank that has your property in California?" It will give you choices. It does that to verify the identity of the person signing the agreement. I use DocuSign a lot.

Jason Medley:

Super smooth, bro. Super slick. I'm sure we have people listening to this edition of The Secret Six Figure Society with varying levels of experience. If you're an experienced investor this may be par for the course for you and it may be something you can easily go out and implement. For those of you all who are new, I know that we've shown you a lot. It's probably like drinking from a fire hose tonight. For the VERY new you may want to check out FlipMyFirstHouse.com to find out how to get started.

The thing I want to share with you is don't get overwhelmed. Everything that Joe is showing you that he's automated and that he's removed himself from, he probably did this one step at a time. When he started his business he was like, "Okay, I don't want to contact all these sellers. I don't want to look for the leads. How do I get someone else to look for the leads?" Get that automated.

"Okay, now that I have the leads, I don't want to talk to 150 people a month. How do I get out of talking to 150 people a month? Okay, if I'm doing four or five deals a month I don't want to sign all these contracts." You just start automating your life and your business one step at a time.

Make that list that I shared with you. I don't want to do it, I don't need to do it, I don't have to do it. Just start making a list. Start knocking things off slowly. I'm sure Joe, for people who are new, this is probably like, "Oh my gosh."

Joe McCall:

That's why I got so excited when you said, "Hey, let's give content and give me the nitty-gritty details," because I don't get to do that on webinars ever.

**Jason Medley:** This is tight, brother. This has been a great call.

Joe McCall:

The other cool thing that DocuSign will do here because I have to rush through this really quickly because we have so much to cover. Docusign will give you a link to this agreement now. You can set up what's called a template or something, and then you fill it out where the person signs. Instead of actually sending them an email, you can have just a link on your website where they go to your website, they click on that link, it opens up DocuSign on a web page, and they can fill out your agreement right there online.

I've taken it to another step where I don't even have to send them a contract. I just tell them, "Hey, go to this website and you can fill out my contract right there online. Just tell me the rent that you want and we'll work out the rest of the details."

**Jason Medley:** Nice.

**Joe McCall:** Who has a fax machine anymore either? Anymore you have to ask the seller to print something and then drive to FedEx Kinkos and fax it for you there. This allows people to sign things online. That's what I love about it.

That feature where you just give them a link to go to a page to fill out an agreement, that is a premium feature in DocuSign. I use it a lot and I love it.
Chapter 8

### Find Your Market

Joe McCall:

Now, what does my marketing say? I already said this. I keep it as simple as possible. I don't have a website, I don't make it sounds sales-y. It's just really simple. "I saw your house, I was wondering if it was available for lease purchase?"

If the guy has mobile homes he can say, "I was wondering if you have any mobile homes you want to sell."

Postcards – I'm going to go through this really quickly. What do I look for in each market? Where are the buyers? Let me show you something that's really cool. When I'm doing research for a market and I do this all the time, actually.

I wanted to do some marketing in Riverside County in California. I go to Google and I'm going to type in Riverside County Heat Map. I'm talking about direct mail now because I've shown you how I do all my Craigslist marketing.

By the way, my VA also sends emails but I wasn't going to show you how that was done because everybody knows how to send email.

Now I want to do some postcards. I want to know the best zip codes to send these postcards to. I want to target the median priced areas in a county. What I'm going to do is find out where the median priced homes are. Where do I want to target my marketing?

I'm going to type in the county that I'm looking for, Riverside County, and I type in heat map. It's going to give me Trulia link right here. Trulia is a website. It's going to take me to the county and it's going to color code this county. This color code is really powerful because it shows you in the yellow where the median prices are.

This is giving me the average listing prices. You'll notice the average listing price in this county is $207,000.00 to $252,000.00. There's always a difference between listing price and sales price. If I click on "Median Sales Price" it bumps down to $162,000.00 to $198,000.00.

I want to know which zip codes should I mail to where there's the highest demand for housing. The highest demand for housing is always going to be right in the middle. It's a bell curve. This is the median sales price for a reason, because this is where most of the houses are being sold and this is where the most affordable houses are, that people want.

You just put your mouse over here and you find the zip codes. It's 92509, so I'm going to write that zip code down. Here's another one, 92521, I'm going to write that one down. 92555, I may go for the light greens, so this zip code right here, 92571, 92582, so you get my point. I'm just going through here and finding where all the hotbed of activity is. These are the counties I want to target, the yellow, the light greens, and maybe the oranges.

Now what I do is I go into ListSource. It's my favorite place to go to get leads. I'm going to do a few things here real quickly.

I'm going to build a list. You go to ListSource.com, go to Build List and I'm going to look for, let's do 92509. I want to know how many cash buyers are in that zip code. I'm also going to do another search here for 92501. I'm also looking for where most of the investor activity is. I'm going to show you two ways to do this.

I'm going to make a list of 20 zip codes. I'm going to go in here to ListSource. I'm going to do Geography Criteria, I'm going to go down to Zip Code. You select a state, California in this case. I'm going to type in these zip codes one at a time – 92507. I'm going to add that in here.

Then, I'm going to go to Options and I'm going to say, "Give me absentee owned properties only."

It was at 9,000 and it's going to drop down to 2,500 absentee owners in that zip code. Right next to 92507 I'm going to write 2,579.

I'm going to go back to Geography here and I'm going to remove that zip code and I'm going to add in the next one, 92509. Add that in and that's going to give me a count. 92501, add that zip code in. That gives me 1,243 absentee owners.

I forgot something very important. You go to Property and you also want to search for "Last Market Sale Date". You want to click "Last Six Months." I'm looking for the zip codes that have the hottest activity in the last six months and then I add that last six months into here.

It's going to drop this down to 37. That zip code at 37 purchases in the last six months.

I'm going to go back here to Geography, I'm going to remove that zip code and I'm going to do a new zip code here. You just go through the top 20 zip codes that you wrote down and find out what are the best five or seven zip codes that you're going to mail to because that's where most of the investors are buying homes.

I'm going to type in the other one here, 92507. You do this and you'll get a list. You can rank and sort the list. 92507 will have 83 cash transactions or absentee owners purchased homes – 83 in that zip code.

I'm not trying to sell FreedomSoft, but there's also a thing in FreedomSoft called Cash Buyers. If I go into Cash Buyers I can do a search for all of the recent cash transactions by zip code in a certain county, and then I can export that into a spreadsheet and then I can find out what are the hottest zip codes for investors. You select your state, California. You select your county. Not every county in the U.S. is here. In the last six months, I click search. This is going to take about five minutes so I'll come back to this later.

This is going to give me then in that county all of the cash buyers in the last six months, and then I can break that down by zip code inside the spreadsheet and find out where all my hot activity is.

Then, why did I say all that? I'm going to go back into ListSource now. Let's go into Property. I'm going to remove this date. I know now I want to target zip code 92507 and I want a list of all of the absentee homes in that zip code that were purchased over five years ago. Then you just manipulate the dates. I won't do that right now, but you manipulate the dates.

These are now all the absentee owned properties in that zip code purchased over five years ago, let's say, or you could do 10 years ago. Then what you do is you go down here and you purchase that list. It works out to be about $.06 to $.18 a name.

Now I have 950 absentee owners right there in that zip code that I know has a lot of activity, and I can go now and I can purchase that list for about $.10 a name. Now I can send postcards.
Chapter 9

### Mail This?

Joe McCall:

Where do I send postcards? I use Click2Mail. I have not outsourced downloading the names, although I could. I want to make sure I'm getting a good quality list of absentee owners, so I like doing this myself. Once I have my list of 6,000 absentee owners that I want to mail, I put that in the spreadsheet. I put it into Google Docs and then my VAs once a week will go into Click2Mail.

What Click2Mail does is I already have my postcard templates in there. What they do is they will upload the names and the addresses from my spreadsheet, they'll upload them into the template that I've already created for my postcard. I have already uploaded money into Click2Mail as well. It's not like they have to have my credit card number. I've already uploaded money into Click2Mail. They're going to upload the names, Click2Mail will do all the merge fields. Click2Mail will bring in the date, it'll bring in "Dear Mr. Smith, We want to buy your house at 123 Main Street," so it will bring in all the merged fields. They upload it and 30 seconds later they click "Submit" and I just sent out 2,000 postcards. I love Click2Mail. Why anybody would try to do postcards by hand I'll never understand.

Click2Mail will print ugly, yellow postcards which convert the best, ugly yellow postcards that don't have any pictures or graphics.

In fact, this is what my postcard looks like right there. It's about that size, as well. It's maybe four or five inches by three inches. It gives a date, their name is in black, it's highlighted. "My company is interested in buying your property located at 3037 West Ina Road in Tucson."

By the way, I got this postcard from some guru a long time ago.

Jason Medley:

Chris Chico.

Joe McCall:

No, this isn't Chris Chico's. It's close to his. I think this is Richard Rupe's postcard.

Jason Medley:

I gotcha.

Joe McCall:

Chris Chico borrowed heavily, I'll just say, from Richard Rupe. They're both very similar and they both poll the same.

"We buy several houses each month and we're looking to buy more in this area. Should you have any interest in selling quickly and easily at a fair price, call us at this number. You can also go to our website and submit your property information. Here are the details. You can have a 24 hour free recorded message to this number. If you're not interested," etcetera.

That postcard outperforms every other postcard known to man. I am not kidding. Why realtors constantly send these glossy postcards, I just saw one the other day. It so annoyed me. It was a realtor who was super huge, standing on top of this house saying, "I can sell your house fast. I'm on top of it."

Jason Medley:

Was he also on his phone?

Joe McCall:

Yeah, pretending to be busy. I don't know, maybe that postcard does convert but I can pretty much guarantee it flopped. He just wasted $2,000.00 sending these pretty postcards that show him standing on top of a house saying, I'm on top of it." Realtors do these plays on words with their last names and they're talking on a phone. It's just, stop it for heaven's sake. You just don't get it.

This type of marketing is personal, it's ugly, it grabs their attention, and it works. The cool thing is, I don't have to lick any stamps. My VAs can send all these postcards every day. In fact, if you wanted to you could have your VAs schedule that it sends out 50 postcards every day and it just sends out 50 or 100 postcards every day to these sellers.

The thing that's really important is I am laser focused. These VAs are sending postcards to zip codes that I've done research on. You can train the VAs to do the research yourself. I'm targeting where the hottest activity is, the best zip codes where there's the highest demand, there are the most cash buyers, and I'm sending postcards to absentee owners who bought their houses 10 years ago, so there's still some equity in them.

You couldn't do this stuff five years ago. This is what technology has done and this is what allows us, Jason, to flip these properties from anywhere in the world. I don't have to be in an office. I don't have to be in my house in St. Louis. I can do all of this from Prague, from Costa Rica, from Panama, it doesn't matter.

It's the same if you're making offers on MLS properties. You could get access to the MLS from anywhere in the world, you can go to Realtor.com and you could just spit out numbers and have your realtor submit offers for you. Anyway, that's a whole other story.

Yellow letters – I'm going to give you a great recommendation for yellow letters. YellowLetterMail.com. The guy who runs that company is an investor himself. You can't get your yellow letters cheaper anywhere else. YellowLetterMail.com. If you give him my coupon code you'll get $.10 off per letter. It works out to be about $.89 or $.99 per yellow letter. They're red, hand written yellow letters that are personalized with the name and address, folded four ways, stuck into an invitation envelope, hand addressed at the top of the envelope with a live stamp. It converts like gang busters, 8-10%.

You get about double or triple the response rate that you do with postcards. This guy is cheaper. The coupon code if you want it is JOE McCALL. If you send him an email, tell him you heard about him from me. He will give you a good deal. He'll give you a discount. Nobody can do it cheaper. You can also buy your absentee owners lists from him.

Let me show you the yellow letter that I send real quickly. I've tested this. I used to send letters that were a lease purchase, "Hey, I'll lease purchase your house," and it just flopped. It didn't do well. Now, the only letter that I send is, "Hey, I want to buy your house," and it reads like this:

"Dear Name," and I do this from a husband and wife. "My name is Shannon. My husband Keith and I would like to purchase your house at," and it has the address of the home. "If you're interested in selling, please call Keith to discuss options. You can act quickly with no long, drawn out bank approvals – a typical hassle when you sell your house for sale by owner or through an agent. Oh, I almost forgot. Don't do anything to your house, as we are willing to buy it as is without any need for you to fix it up. Please call anytime during the day. Keith's direct cell phone number is... Or after 7:00 p.m. please call his work number," which is a 24 hour answering service. "We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, Shannon."

You see how all of this marketing I'm doing is very personal. It does not look like it's coming from a big corporate fat cat investor. It's coming from Joe Blow, a little small town investor who's looking to buy some properties. Your VAs can send this for you. I love it.

### Smile & Dial (or have a VA do it for you)

Bonus: Access The Private Video Presentation By Clicking Here

Joe McCall:

I'm almost done. I also have my VAs do cold calls. This is the script I have my VAs, when they're doing cold calls, this is what they say. They'll typically cold call anywhere from 30 to 50 sellers a day in each market. Sometimes we'll go after different types of deals. We'll go after cheap rental properties and our only message is, "Hey, we want to buy your house." We'll go after nice rental homes and we'll ask them, "Do you want to lease purchase your house?"

We'll also go after properties that are listed for rent and we do the strategy called quick turn leasing where we will actually flip the lease. We give an option to the seller to lease the property, we get it under an option contract, we advertise it for rent, and we fill these things within a week. We get them rented and we keep one month's rent for our profit to do this. We do this in the higher end markets like California where the rents are $2,000.00, $3,000.00. We flip these as leases and we keep one month's rent because of profit. It's not a whole lot of money - $1,000.00, $2,000.00 but you can do five, six, eight of those a month very easily and you can outsource literally 100% of that to realtors to do for you. You just need to get on the phone and have a VA make those cold calls for you.

On those calls, we'll call and say, "Hey, I saw you had your house on Craigslist. If we could find you a tenant in a week or two weeks in exchange for one month's rent, you wouldn't be interested in that, would you?" We just be quiet and my VAs let them talk. One out of every 30 will say, "Yeah, we got a deal." We average one deal a day with that.

My cold calling script is real simple. My VAs will say something like, "Hey, I saw your house on Craigslist. Is it still available? Can you tell me a little bit about it? We are investors who buy and lease properties. Would you be open to leasing your house for a few years and then selling it?" Simple as that.

My VAs have great English. You can't tell they're from the Philippines. We have different scripts depending on what exactly we're trying to do here. Some of my favorite questions to ask sellers – this is either when I am talking to them after my VAs have prescreened them out or my VAs are actually closing them.

We'll ask questions like, "What are you going to do if you can't sell your house? Rent it?" A lot of times sellers have never thought of that, so then we'll say, "Why would you want to rent it to a tenant? Are you prepared for your typical landlord headaches? Why not rent it to somebody who wants to buy it?" Then we shut up. We always are asking questions. Everything in my script is a question. It's pull versus push. I'm not pushing them into anything.

I am the buyer, this is really important to write down. When you're talking to sellers on the phone, remember you are the buyer, they are the seller. They need to sell you on their house. You need to play the role of the reluctant buyer. Use negative phrasing. I start conversations all the time with, "Hey, it sounds like I caught you at a bad time."

"No, no. This is fine. I can talk right now."

Then you know they've invited you in. They've given you permission to talk to them. Then you say things like, "I don't know if this could be for you. I understand you probably have a good handle on all of this, but we have a bunch of buyers looking for homes in this area. You wouldn't be interested in them, would you? You wouldn't be interested in getting access to our buyers, would you?" using the negative phrasing.

I like this question, too, "Mr. Seller, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your house to see if I would even be interested in making an offer on it?" I'm staying in control. I'm asking the questions. I used to spout off all the benefits of working with me, "I can buy your house fast. I can close in seven days. I'll buy your house as is." Now I turn it into a question. "Mr. Seller, let me ask you something. It's okay if you say no, I understand. If I could buy your house in seven days, pay cash, close quickly, buy it as is," etcetera, "what's the best price you can give me?" I asked it as a question. I listed the benefits in the question. "If I could do this, would you be willing to do this? Is there any reason why we couldn't do business today?"

The seller brings up objections. I'll say things like, "I can understand why you might be concerned about that. Let me ask you something. If I could resolve that for you and take care of that for you, is there any reason why we couldn't do business today?" Probably not.

My scripts that I give to my VAs are very simple. It's just some basic questions. My big thing I tell my assistants, and even when I'm on the phone is never be on the phone longer than three to five minutes with a seller. You should know whether they're ready to do a deal or not. You're in business to make money today. If the seller is not ready to do business today, get off the phone.

Don't send them a contract unless they've given you a deadline of when they'll give it back to you. Sometimes I'll tell sellers when they say, "I need to think about it," I'll say, "Mr. Seller, let's just be honest with each other. When I hear that somebody needs to think about it, that really means no. Isn't that right? You're just not interested. That's fine. It's okay to say no."

"Well, I need to talk to my wife about it."

Jason Medley:

That's somebody who's too polite to tell you no.

Joe McCall:

Yeah, that's why I get to the point. They say, "I need to talk to my wife about it."

"Okay, great. When can we talk to her? Let's get her on the phone right now. Will she be available tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. or tonight at 5:00 p.m.?" I give them deadlines.

If they say, "Just come out and meet me at the house."

"I'd love to meet you at the house, sir, but I don't want to waste your time. Let me ask you something. If I could send you an agreement right now and if we can agree on the numbers and agree to the terms, would you be ready to sign that agreement right then?"

Unless they say, "Yeah, if I agree to the numbers I'll go ahead and sign the agreement," I'm not going to go out and meet with them. This is all about managing your time.

This is so important. If you're going to be flipping these deals virtually, you don't have time to waste talking to unmotivated sellers. The harder you chase them, the faster they'll run. Think about it. You're trying to negotiate this deal from 5,000 miles away. You have to be on your A game and you need to be able to convince them that doing business with you is their best option. It's really not that hard.

That's why I talk about the four or five keys to success, marketing, automation, and delegation, and then learning how to talk to sellers, learning sales skills like this. It takes guts, but you can do it.
Chapter 11

### Outsource

Joe McCall:

I have all these systems. Now I want to delegate them out. What do I do? What I do is real simple. I get a Google Doc and I write down everything that I do, and then I Jing it. What is Jing? Jing is a simple screen cast program. I don't know if they're offering Jing for free anymore. Just Google Jing and if you go to Jing, it might still be free. It is. They were threatening to take it away because they have another product they want people to pay for called Snag It.

There's another tool called Screenr. What these programs do is they record your screen and they record your voice. It's instant screen cast, just click record. Now I have this Google Doc. Here's one I did for one of my students. I just let my student copy it and send it to his VA.

It says, "Hey, this is the purpose of what I'm doing here. I want to find nice homes. I'm doing this type of marketing and I want to do at least 40 homes a day. I want you to send this between 8:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. PST." Remember, they're doing this marketing from the Philippines. You don't want them to send voice blasts and text messages at 2:00 a.m. I have to make it very clear, only between these hours. That's happened to me, Jason.

Jason Medley:

You always say, "Ask me how I know."

Joe McCall:

I got so many angry, ticked off people. They said, "What are you doing calling me at 4:00 a.m.?" I was so embarrassed.

Jason Medley:

Let me just stress to people, this is how you systematize your business. This is how you actually have a business. This is how you actually gain freedom rather than being a slave to your business. You have to go through and write things out step by step by step. You can write them down on paper, or you can do what Joe said which is called a screen cast where you basically, as you're speaking about what you're doing on the screen, it's recording your voice onscreen. I've already had like 10 questions from you guys, "When are we going to get the replay?"

The only reason you're going to get a replay is because I've used a product called Camtasia which is sold by the same company as Jing which is basically recording everything we're doing. I'll post it up on a blog and then you'll get to use it and you'll get to view that content again versus Joe and I having to come back on and do this call all over again because you couldn't write as fast as we can talk.

The thing I want to drive home to everybody is this is how you systematize your business. You have to lay it out, step by step. That way you can give it off to someone else and then you can go do what you want to do.

Joe McCall:

Right. We just created bullet points. These are your search parameters. When you go into Craiglist, search for this. Look for minimum rents of $1,000.00, minimum bedrooms of three. They can ignore ads that have these words in them. Ignore ads in these areas.

Then what we did is we listed all this stuff, go to these websites. I didn't even talk about FSBO sites. You can get tons of leads from FSBO sites. Do the marketing in this order.

What we do then is I write all this out and I record my screen in Jing or Screenr and I walk through how to do all this stuff. I walk through going through Craigslist and clicking on each of these ads and looking for certain things and taking this phone number and copying it into its Google Docs spreadsheet and how to check for duplicates.

Then, once you have all these numbers copied, upload them to Google Voice and send them a text message, then take these emails and send them these emails. In fact, on here we have the emails we want them to send. This is about four or five pages, but I give them three different email scripts. I want them to mix it up between these three different email scripts. It's just one sentence, but I want them each different so that Craigslist doesn't start blocking them.

They just follow these instructions, and then they have a video watching me do it. The cool thing now, and this is what gets me so excited about outsourcing, is when you lose your VA, and you will. You might fire them or let them go. All you need to do is unshared the document in Google Docs with your old VA, share it with your new VA, and say, "Hey, read this document and watch this video."

In fact, here's the link that I did for these instructions. It's right there, it's a link. If you go there it'll bring up the video of us walking through that.

I did that a couple of years ago. There's the video.

I've already trained all of my future VAs. Let's say I want to bring on new VAs. I just create a new document maybe for a different city or something like that and I say, "Watch this video and do this every day." I don't have to train them. I'll show you how I find my VAs here in a minute. I don't have to worry about finding a VA who has really good English. If they can read that document and watch my videos, they can do exactly what I want them to do.

Are we doing okay with time?

Jason Medley:

We're at about two hours. The thing is, everybody is still on the call but my only concern is that I've lost recordings before when go out this far because the bandwidth gets so bad.

Joe McCall:

Give me just two more minutes.

Jason Medley:

We have two more minutes, bro. We're good.

Joe McCall:

The best source for VAs – my favorite website is oDesk.com. You can track your VAs. My full time VAs I don't use oDesk, these are just my part time VAs. One lady who does my bookkeeping here and this one does some customer service calls for me.

You can go into oDesk and see how they work, what they're doing when they're working.

It takes screen shots of their screen every few minutes to show me that they're working and doing what they're supposed to be doing. Is that cool or what?

Jason Medley:

That is so cool.

I'll give you a perfect example of how we use a VA, as well. I'm going to be starting an amazing new site and I'm working on it. It's going to have a blog and I don't want the site to have no content on it when I start it out. I have to get a bunch of content on it so when I roll it out to everybody when you go to it and I say, "Hey, go check it out," there's actually legitimate content on there and a lot of it.

I don't want to take the time to write 100 articles about real estate, so I basically created a process today where I gave the VA the names of the three biggest blogs and forums on the internet, like Bigger Pockets and stuff like that, and I told her to go through on a lot of the most viewed articles, find out who the authors were and get their information, get their website, go to their website, get their contact information and then contact those individuals to ask them if we can reuse their articles on my new site as long as we gave them credit, etcetera.

I don't want to call all those people. I don't want to dig up all that information. That's something that could take days to deal with. We just outsourced it on oDesk.

Joe McCall:

Here's the cool thing – I created this job 24 days ago and I forgot about it. I feel like a total schmuck. In the county of St. Louis County, you can go in and find out who all of the delinquent taxpayers are, the delinquent property taxes. There's a 500 page scanned PDF of all of these people who have been delinquent in taxes, long story. It's like 500 freaking pages of a PDF.

I posted a job in oDesk saying I want somebody to go to every page, and each page has about six addresses. I want somebody to go through each page and type into a spreadsheet all of the addresses of these delinquent tax people. I've had 443 people apply for this job.

I posted another job. I wanted somebody to actually go into our county website and scrape information off of the county website. I had 14 or 15 people apply to that.

I have 443 here. You can sort by lowest rate if you wanted and you're going to find people here. This guy is $61.00 an hour. Here's $.06 an hour, $.56 an hour, $.89 an hour, $1.00 an hour. I don't know how good these people are. A lot of the cheapest ones have zero work history, no feedback.

You can go in here and sort by highest feedback. I see my list here. Here's somebody, $39.00 an hour, $11.00 an hour.

I'm surprised they're this high. No wonder I had 443. This is not an hourly quote. Nobody from Hungary is asking for $28.00 an hour. Nobody from the Philippines is asking for $56.00 an hour. I asked for a per job quote, so I think these are quotes for the entire job. People are quoting me $44.00 to go through this PDF and type in these addresses.

Jason Medley:

Versus if you got somebody to do that in the States at even minimum wage.

Joe McCall:

Yeah, it would have been $500.00, I don't know.

Jason Medley:

Yeah, it would have been $500.00. These are not hourly quotes, I forgot. These are people for the entire job, $44.00.

Sometimes these guys will quote you $11.00 and I'll go ahead and give them the job. Maybe they can do it for $11.00. I don't care if they screw it all up, it's just $10.00 and maybe they'll get it right.

VirtualStaffFinder.com is a great website to go to if you're looking for a fulltime VA. You have to pay them $350.00, but they'll go out and find you three prequalified VAs. You interview them and you hire one of them, and then you pay that VA directly. You don't have to pay Virtual Staff Finder.

There's another guy we know whose name is Daven Michaels. He runs a company called 123Employee.com. He's a great resource to go to. He's a little more expensive than Virtual Staff Finder.

oDesk is great for project specific VAs. Virtual Staff Finder and 123 Employee are really good for full time, dedicated VAs just for you.

The sellers send me pictures to show me the house, the realtor takes the calls and advertises the properties on postlets, vFlyers, and Craigslist. The realtors coordinate the showings and they handle the paperwork.

I find realtors by putting ads on Craigslist, of course. "I'm an investor looking for a realtor to help me lease my properties." Realtors represent me, they don't represent the sellers.

For phones, this is important. This is my last slide. When you're traveling overseas you have to have good phones. You have to learn how to get good phones. I use Skype, Google Voice, Vumber is a great resource to use. Google Voice will only give you one number. Vumber will let you have as many as you want. I have probably 30. We do marketing for students with our VAs, so I have about 30 virtual phone numbers of different markets all over the country and it only costs me an extra $5.00 per number.

What Vumber does is my VAs can send all this marketing and it looks like it comes from this local number in that market. Then, when a sellers calls that Vumber it actually reroutes to the investor's cell phone or it goes to voicemail or whatever. Let's say you're in Texas doing deals in California. You dial your Vumber and then you dial the number you want to call. That seller will see on their caller ID another local phone number. It makes it look like it's completely virtual. Vumbers are great to put on banded signs, as well. It kind of cloaks your number.

Vonage is another great resource if you're going to be international doing calls. If you're going to be international you have to get a local cell phone. You can get prepaid phones for very cheap and you'll do very well.
Chapter 12

### Always Be Learning

Joe McCall:

If I had it to do differently next time, when I was in Prague I would be more disciplined with my time. We goofed off a lot. We spent a lot of time doing sightseeing and stuff. I did set aside time to work, but I didn't always work as much as I should have.

If I were to do it again I could have done more deals and I could have made more money if I would have been more disciplined. We flipped two deals, granted, but I didn't do as much as I wanted. I didn't meet my goals. I wanted to flip four and I wanted to flip a bunch of properties in this new market. We got the market started, we got it going.

I would have also made sure I had my own Wi-Fi, my own internet. I didn't want to spend the money on it, but looking back I should have. I should have gotten one of those, you know how AT&T and Verizon have those wireless 3G or 4G internet cards? You can get those in other countries in Europe and South America or whatever. I should have spent the money to get that and I should have been willing to spend the extra money for making international calls from my cell phone.

Part of the problem when you're in other countries is your landlords, your coffee shops, they will throttle the internet. In third world countries and even industrial countries like Prague there is a lot of illegal downloading of movies and sometimes a lot of the locals will go to coffee shops to get their high speed internet and will download a ton of movies from Pirate Bay or whatever. They will throttle the internet, which makes it difficult to make calls on Skype. If I were to do it again I would make sure I had my own internet and I would spend the extra money to make calls internationally with my cell phone so I don't have to rely on really fast internet to make phone calls.

That's all I have. I have a website where I started blogging about our trip in Prague and flipping properties remotely. You gave me permission to share this. It's just a blog. I don't have anything to sell on there. It's RemotePropertyFlipping.com. On there I have a lot of tutorials on how I flip lease options and how I do traditional wholesaling. I'm adding to it constantly with new tutorials that kind of relate to this stuff. It's a good place to go if you want to keep track.

When we go to Costa Rica I'm going to blog more about our trip to Costa Rica and the deals we're flipping there. Even though I'm back in St. Louis I'm still flipping deals in California. I'm flipping deals with students in other states. This is really a dream come true for me, man. I remember 10 years ago reading this stuff and thinking, "I could never do that." and here I am doing it. It blows me away.

Jason Medley:

Joe, I've got to tell you, I'm super impressed with tonight. This call was off the charts. Gang, go visit Joe's website, go check out his blog. I'm sure there's a bunch of other valuable content there. This was hot, man. I would like to say that relative to most products that you'll buy that you'll spend $97.00 on, you'll probably get more value out of this than you do most of those products.

Joe, I'm just really grateful for your time. I appreciate you coming on and really getting nitty-gritty and sharing some of this stuff. I learned a lot by being on here, to be quite frank with you. I already have several ideas on how to use Sly Dial. It's awesome, bro. I'm really, really appreciative of it and I know everybody on the call was. I know from looking at the comments everybody was very, very grateful.

Joe, I'm getting lots of people coming in and saying thanks. Thanks for blowing the doors off of it, man.

One other thing, guys. I'm going to send an email to all of the attendees tomorrow. I'll give you the link to Joe's blog again in that email and also I'm going to ask you to go to my Facebook page and actually just put some "Woohoos" out there about how we rocked the house on our 110% content call tonight. This is not normal, guys. I hope you know that. This is over the top.

Joe McCall:

I sell this stuff for a lot of money, man.

Jason Medley:

Yeah, I know and I'm hoping everybody appreciates that. This isn't a complete start to finish system in a package on a DVD or what have you, but what you got tonight was off the charts, man. You have a unique way of doing business and it's gotten me excited about the fact that you're coming to The Secret Six Figure Society because I'm sure the guys in my group – I don't know anyone else in there who does lease options but sometimes it's not about that, it's just about how you're using technology and how they can apply it to their business. Kudos man, awesome call.

Joe McCall:

We're getting great comments on here. I'll go ahead and stay online and answer some of these questions just by writing in here if you want.

Jason Medley:

Okay, cool. Yeah, lots of thank yous. "Freaking awesome call. You did not lie when you said it would be 100% content, thank you so much. Put the replay up ASAP. I was writing my butt off. See you on Facebook, Jason. We'll go to your page. Does he offer this as a program?" That is a true comment guys. I'm not trying to sell anything. If you do want to learn really step by step what Joe does, Joe do you have a website you can give folks to go if they want to buy your system or whatever?

Joe McCall:

Yeah, I have two websites. I have a course that I created on wholesaling lease options.

Jason Medley:

Why don't you type it up there? "Thank you, I feel we earned a Master's degree. Wonderful presentation."

Joe McCall:

WholesalingLeaseOptions.com is one of them. In case you are interested I have a $97.00 a month academy where you get all of my stuff in weekly modules here.

I also have a podcast, RealEstateInvestingMastery.com. The podcast is a bunch of really good free stuff. One good thing about the podcast is there on that website is a bonus. We have free videos on there. I give a crash course on how I flip lease options.

I'd say go to RealEstateInvestingMastery.com first and you can get access to these videos we created, they're free, on how I flip lease options, how my co-host does traditional wholesaling. We talk on there and we actually have a whole video on how we find, hire, and train our virtual assistants. We talk about the marketing that we do.

My co-host, Alex Youngblood does some pretty crazy things. His VA actually makes offers to all of his sellers on the phone. VAs call all the sellers back, they take the tax assessed value or the Zillow value, they multiply it by 70% and subtract $30,000.00 for repairs and make an offer. If the seller expresses some interest, then they pass it on to Alex. These VAs are just making the offers right there on the phone by looking at Zillow, multiplying by 70%, subtracting $30,000.00 for repairs.

There are so many things you can do in this business. You can wholesale properties from anywhere in the world.

If there's anybody still on, we still have a ton of people on.

Jason Medley:

I know. Joe, if you would email me that spreadsheet where you kind of broke out your income goal, I'll get that put up on our webpage and send that to everybody who attended, as well.

This was awesome. I have to tell you, Joe, I'm thinking about starting up a membership program where instead of people paying thousands and thousands of dollars for courses all the time, maybe just a couple hundred bucks to get content calls like this twice a month. The comments, when I go into Go To Meeting the comments that will be in the attendee report, what social proof that will be, right?

Joe McCall:

I need to save these and print them or something.

Jason Medley:

I'll send them to you, brother.

Joe McCall:

Please do that. I need to save these.

Jason Medley:

Yeah, give me a day or two and I'll get it all over to you.

Joe McCall:

I'm tired, actually. I don't see any more questions here. We've pretty much answered all of them.

Somebody asked if the sales techniques I was using, if it was the Quad Diamond Guts system. Yeah, Quad Diamond is one of my mentors. Everything I've learned about talking to sellers I learned from him. It's funny that somebody recognized that.

Jason Medley:

Gang, we're shutting it off. Please know I appreciate you, that's why I do these things. I'm very, very grateful to everybody. You guys follow me, put your faith in me, and put your trust in me. I don't take it for granted and I hope everybody has a blessed night. I hope this call impacted you. I hope it changes your business. I hope it changes your life and I hope it changes the way you think about what you can and can't accomplish. You are not built to be anything other than successful. That's what I always say to myself. God did not build me to be a failure; he only built me to be successful.

I hope that you will hold that in your hearts and just get out and take life by storm. As Joe has shown you, it can be done.

We're signing off. Thanks.
