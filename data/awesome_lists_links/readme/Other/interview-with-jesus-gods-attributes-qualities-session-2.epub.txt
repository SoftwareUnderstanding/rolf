1. Introduction

**Interviewer** : Hello, welcome. We're back here for the second interview on God's attributes and qualities.

**AJ** : G'day, Luli.

**Interviewer** : There are a few questions that I'd like to clear up from last week before we go back to talking about some of the other attributes.

**AJ** : Sure.

2. God's location and interaction with the universe

**Interviewer** : Last week we were talking about God's location being outside the universe, and how God comes into the universe to hear our thoughts.

**AJ** : Well, God doesn't have to come into the universe to hear our thoughts or to do anything else. But God is able to come into the universe with parts of His or Her Nature. There are certain things that come from God that can enter the universe, just like there are certain things that are in our nature that can exit the universe. For example, when we say a prayer to God that we actually feel from our heart, it actually causes particles to exit the universe and then enter God's location or enter God Herself. And when God has feelings for us, those feelings actually pass through the boundary of the universe and into our soul. Therefore we've got communication and transmission of matter occurring between ourselves and God, not only throughout the universe, but the communication also exceeds the boundaries of the universe because God obviously exists outside of the universe. [00:02:02.15]

**Interviewer** : When you said that God comes into the universe you're talking about certain feelings, Divine Love and energies that God...

**AJ** : Yeah. Let's call them certain qualities or attributes of God that enter the universe. God Himself or Herself does not seem to fully enter the universe, and in fact I believe that it's probably not possible for God to do so in the sense that God is too large for the universe to contain Him or Her; not in the sense that it's physically impossible, but rather in the sense that the universe is too small to contain God.

2.1. God does not manifest physical or spiritual bodies to express Himself through

**Interviewer** : Has God ever manifested physical bodies or spiritual bodies?

**AJ** : Well, no, there's no reason for God to do so. Obviously God has had children; we are the progeny of God and if you like we, being the progeny of God, are able to manifest or create a spirit and material body for people to actually enter. From that perspective the universe was constructed as the playground for God's children rather than the playground for God. I'm not sure how big God's playground is but I'm pretty certain it's much bigger than the playground that He's made for His children. [00:03:21.24]

**Interviewer** : One reason that God might want to manifest bodies would be to teach people about God?

**AJ** : God always uses what He's created to teach people about God, including the souls of His children. The reality is that God does not need to manifest a body in order to teach people about God, and in fact God wishes for people to learn about God through this really much more smooth and also, you would say, indirect manner. Thirdly you'd have to question why God would want to manifest a body when the body itself would be a restriction of God's nature. The only reason why we have a physical body, for example, is so that we can express our nature, not be restricted by it.

**AJ** : Now when we lose our physical body and we go to a spirit body we're less restricted again so we're growing through the process from full restriction, in other words where we don't know how to utilise our free will. By using our body and expressing our body we begin to learn how to use our free will; we learn what happens when we live in harmony with love and we learn what happens when we don't. As the process of learning goes on the physical body becomes a constraint and once we enter the spirit world that constraint is lifted. Then we have a spirit body, which we can use to grow further. And once we've gone through the process of growing with that body then that body starts becoming a constraint and now we can begin to understand the soul and how it learns; now we're not constrained by either a physical body or a spirit body.

**AJ** : Now I'm not saying that we have to not be constrained by a physical body or a spirit body in order to learn. What I'm saying is that the body is actually a tool for our learning, whereas God does not need a tool for His learning and God also doesn't need to create tools other than the tools God's already created for our learning. I believe there's an infinite number of tools that God has created for us to learn and so there's little need for God to actually become present within the universe in a physical form. [00:05:34.16]

3. God's Love

3.1. Different types of love that God puts into the universe transform the universe

**Interviewer** : Okay. So God puts Divine Love into the universe, obviously, so that we can receive it if we long for it. Does that Divine Love also affect animals and inanimate objects?

**AJ** : Well you could say that God has many forms of love but the primary form of love that God has for his children is Divine Love. The form of love that God has for all creatures, the general love that God has for all creatures is a different type of a love in that God gives that love to all creatures and all objects within the universe, in ever-increasing amounts. If any object in the universe is open to the reception of that love then that thing or object will receive that love and therefore have a transformation. Sometimes those transformations can be evolutionary steps that are all of a sudden changing into greater evolutionary steps, rather than the slow process of evolution. In other words, with evolutionary steps, once God gives more love, the capacity of the universe to change instantly becomes greater and, as soon as it becomes greater, then it's possible for any living organism and anything within that universe to change in an evolutionary step rather than in a slow process.

**AJ** : Now because we are people with souls, from God's perspective and our perspective we have the greatest capacity to change and that great capacity comes from the infusion of Divine Love into our soul. Animals can't receive Divine Love in a personal sense, in the sense that they understand that they are having a relationship with God. Animals are automatically in a relationship with God through their creation and automatically have a relationship with us as well through their creation. They don't actually have a soul that they can receive Divine Love with and use their intellect or their will to actually absorb, whereas with the way God's created our soul, humankind is the only organism that can actually embrace that process in a knowing and understanding manner. [00:07:49.21]

3.2. Receiving Divine Love is permanent

**Interviewer** : When we receive Divine Love it stays with us forever, so how does that work compared to when a person gives another person natural love? How is it that the Divine Love is a permanent thing?

**AJ** : Because the thing is a part of God; anything that is a part of God exists forever. It cannot be erased if something is a part of God. Something that is not a part of God does often change and can be erased. For example if we look at it from a purely material perspective, this table, if we do not maintain it, will degrade over time because of the processes of degradation that occur in an oxygen-based environment and other chemical environments. As a process that will slowly occur over time and eventually we'll end up with a table completely absorbed into other materials or other matter, and eventually even absorbed into other living things. That process of degradation occurs automatically over time because this table doesn't have God's Love in it, and as a result it has to go through this process of change.

**AJ** : The same applies to any substance that comes out of us as a human that isn't a part of God's nature. Anything that I can give to you, which is part of my love for you or my care for you or any other thing that I do for you, it can degrade over a period of time, not only in terms of my expressing it but also in terms of how long it lasts or how long an effect it has inside of you. The difference between that and God's Love is quite marked in the sense that God's Love, because of its infinite nature and because it's a part of God, cannot degrade over time. It can only be suppressed. So in other words, you can have Divine Love enter you and it be suppressed in you through an intellectual process that you are actively involved in suppressing, but the love still exists within you. You can't erase it once it's entered.

**AJ** : However if my love enters you as a substance, which is possible, over a period of time whatever you do with it, because I am not immortal without God's Love and my love itself doesn't create immortality, my love itself, or the love that I express or that enters you from me can degrade. Therefore whatever happens with my love given to you, if all of a sudden I decide not to give it, over time it will diminish in you and perhaps even disappear. You may have a dim memory of that love being expressed to you at one point in the past, but now you don't really feel that love entering you at all. And that is very, very different to God's Love.

**AJ** : Once God's Love enters the soul of an individual, the soul of the individual is automatically transformed. It now depends on what they choose to do with that love as to what happens after that. If they choose to suppress it, if they choose to act in disharmony with the Divine Love that exists within them, then of course they can deny and suppress the effects of that love and even act as if it didn't exist in the first place, but the love still is present within the soul. It cannot be erased once it has entered. [00:11:04.15]

4. The source of God's power is unknown

**Interviewer** : This is another one of those questions from the beginning of last week. But do you know what sustains God? Where all the power comes from and the love comes from?

**AJ** : Again it's a very difficult question to answer because there are just so many possibilities and it's hard enough understanding where our power comes from, let alone understanding where the source of our power comes from. And so that's a very difficult question to answer. In fact I feel it's one of those questions that we might eventually be able to ask and answer in the long run. I feel that mankind, given the time period that we've been as incarnated souls, have still got a long way to go before we can actually answer those kinds of questions.

**AJ** : I feel we can understand the attributes or qualities of God far better than understanding the actual physical form of God, if you could call it that, because those kinds of questions are very, very difficult to actually answer. [00:12:13.16]

**Interviewer** : Okay, no worries. Well during the week I thought of a whole lot of attributes of God.

**AJ** : Good, good. (Laughs)

**Interviewer** : I thought maybe we could talk about them in the context of the major attributes, such as love and power and wisdom and intelligence, because I don't know where these go under those attributes.

**AJ** : Okay, good.

5. Sub-attributes of God's Love

5.1. Beauty

**Interviewer** : One thing that came to me was beauty.

**AJ** : Okay, yes, beauty is an interesting quality of God and actually an interesting quality of the entire universe because beauty exists all the way through the universe. It also seems that within our soul we do see certain things as ugly and certain things as beautiful. I don't believe that all things are beautiful and in fact I feel that what whenever our soul acts in disharmony with love, the creations of our soul at that point are very, very ugly in many cases. That's actually a part of the feedback system that God's provided to educate us and show us that when we act in harmony with love, beauty is the result, and when we act in disharmony with love, ugliness is the result, and ugliness in all sorts of ways; ugliness emotionally, ugliness physically, ugliness in terms of disease and other harm that we perpetrate on the planet. Ugliness in terms of how we respond to each other and all of those are the result of a lack of love.

5.1.1. Our soul condition is reflected in our physical body in a delayed fashion and our spirit body immediately

**AJ** : I believe that beauty is a fantastic thing that God has created to demonstrate to us this feedback system of how the soul is actually working. Now of course generally on Earth we unfortunately measure beauty only by the physical and God doesn't do so, and quite often our soul can be in quite a lot of disharmony with the physical appearance that it has. In other words my soul can be connected to my spirit and my physical body, and initially in my early stages of my development my soul could be getting darker. But because there is usually a seven year time delay upon the physical body in terms of its replication process in the cell structure and so forth, it usually means that I won't see some of the ugliness physically for many years later.

**AJ** : And this is why we grow old and die as our soul follows its education in a negative direction, in terms of a fear-based unloving direction and untruthful direction. The soul becomes slowly more ugly itself and it then has a lack of energy, which is then fed to the physical form and the spirit body form. The spirit body form rapidly deteriorates in its beauty but the physical form, because of the cell replication time frames and so forth, slowly deteriorates based on the soul's issues and problems or whatever the soul's condition is.

**AJ** : So this is why as we get older we get more wrinkled, our body doesn't replicate itself properly, certain parts of the organs start closing down and so forth and by the time we get very, very aged a lot of our body is now shutting down as a result of what happened to our soul many, many years prior in most cases. That's a feedback system, but it's a slower feedback system than what would be present in the spirit world. What's present in the spirit world is a very rapid feedback system. If you take an action that is unloving in its nature or untruthful in its nature the physical form that you see, the spirit body form, degrades in its condition fairly immediately because the cell replication process in the spirit body form is a lot more rapid.

**AJ** : Therefore you see the changes immediately as you degrade in condition or even as you grow in condition; you also see the resulting changes into beauty as you grow in condition. So getting back to God's quality of beauty, I feel there are some things that God's built into our soul that we respond to as beautiful compared to others that we respond to as ugly. Those things in our soul that we respond to as beautiful are all associated with love, and the things we respond to that become ugly are all associated with things like fear and untruthfulness and everything associated with being unloving.

**AJ** : I believe that the beauty quality of God is like a sub-quality; remember we talked about primary qualities and then we talked about sub-qualities. I believe that it's one of the sub-qualities of God's form of justice and also God's Love. When we connect with God and we receive Divine Love we automatically also start becoming more beautiful at the soul level. And then eventually if we become at-one with God it affects our spirit body and physical body so much that both of those bodies no longer age and they also start improving in their condition and God's basically showing us the effects of love. So I'd say beauty is an effect rather than a cause, but it is one of the attributes of what love does. [00:17:54.19]

5.2. Joy

**Interviewer** : The next one on my list is probably highly linked with that, because that is joy. That seems to be an effect of God that's built into our feedback system as well?

**AJ** : Exactly. Yeah, there's a lot of emotions that you could say that we will come to experience in our life that are the direct result or the effects of us embracing other things like truth, love, justice, humility and other qualities, which are real primary qualities of God. As we embrace those primary qualities of God, we'll find that we'll have the secondary effects of joy, happiness, peace and many other qualities that are what I would call displaying our having the primary cause of the effect, which is the love or the truth or the humility or one of the other primary qualities.

5.3. Sensitivity

**Interviewer** : Alright, well I'm going to carry on down my list.

**AJ** : Sure.

**Interviewer** : Okay, sensitivity.

**AJ** : Sensitivity, yes.

**Interviewer** : Because obviously to be able to respond to everybody's prayers and feelings and feel everyone's feelings you've got to be pretty sensitive.

**AJ** : Very much so. One of the primary feelings that you could say inside of God is this direct sensitiveness to every single occurrence in the universe. In the first century I said that God was so sensitive that God could feel how many hairs there were on your head growing at any one point in time. And God can feel when a sparrow dies, when the life force exits something; God feels when the life force exits any one of God's creations because the life force returns to God, and so God feels it. God is extra-sensitive to everything, far more sensitive than we are sensitive.

**AJ** : As we grow in Divine Love we become more sensitive to everything around us and therefore this sensitivity causes us to not act out of harmony with love. In other words at some point we become so sensitive to any disharmony with love that it's impossible for us to act out of with harmony with love without feeling a huge amount of hurt inside of us. And God is encouraging all of us to allow ourselves to be sensitive. It's interesting when you see that as a comparison to what most parents encourage their children to do, which is to stop being sensitive and to encourage their children to be insensitive so that they can cope with the pain of life.

**AJ** : The way God views pain is that if we were so sensitive to pain and its cause, we would never want to embrace the cause of any pain. It makes sense then that sensitivity is one of the attributes of love. And so I feel again that that's one of the attributes of Divine Love; it's one of those sub-qualities. One of the effects of the love operating on the soul of an individual is that they'll become more sensitive. [00:20:58.10]

5.4. Patience

**Interviewer** : I think the next one's another attribute of love: patience.

**AJ** : Patience is certainly another attribute of love, yeah. It's a beautiful aspect of love because it's the opposite to demand and impatience, and if we think about demand and impatience, they impose upon another person that you've got to do a certain thing by a certain time. If you think about the loving thing to do it would be to never impose upon another person that they have to do a certain thing by a certain time. You would just be patient and let it all operate.

**AJ** : Now that doesn't mean you would break your own laws for the time frame. In other words if a person doesn't want to do a certain thing by a certain time, then it's up to you. You can say, "Oh well I don't want to interact with that person on that particular project anymore because they're just taking too long," but that doesn't necessarily mean you're impatient. It might be practical factors about love of other people involved in that. What I mean by that is that sometimes, if there is a group of people working together, if all of the people are working together well except for one person, and the group is not impatient with that one person, but that one person is not performing the task that they've been asked to do for the group, then the group is wise to say to the person, "Well obviously you don't want to do that, and that's fine. You're allowed to not want to do that, and we're totally patient about that. But we want to go ahead and do this so we would like to find a person who does want to embrace that process with us."

**AJ** : So we can be patient and still have deadlines. A lot of people would feel opposite to that perhaps but the truth is that we can feel patient and have deadlines, we can feel patient and have rules. And God does have laws but God is still patient. God's patient about every law you break. God goes, "Well there they go again, they've broken another law and there they go again, feeling the pain of the breaking of another law. There they go again seeing their beauty degrade from breaking this other law and their sensitivity degrade because they broke the law." And God's going, "I wonder when they're going to actually..." God usually does know when but you imagine God there going, "I wonder when they're actually going to work out that they're doing something that's unloving and change." God is very, very patient as a result.

**AJ** : We get a lot of patience from God. If God was totally impatient then I don't think most of us would be alive at this point, because if you think about it there'd be so much pressure on us to change coming from God that it would be very, very difficult to withstand it. You'd also have to question whether we'd have free will anymore if God were impatient. The reality is that patience is definitely one of the primary qualities of God's nature and as we receive more Divine Love we become more patient as a result.

**Interviewer** : It helps if you've got this everlasting infinity of time as well to be patient.

**AJ** : Exactly! Of course, from God's perspective, God's got forever to wait for us to come to God and so there's no need for God to hurry. That being said, I do feel and believe that there is no reason for mankind to not hurry. And what I mean by hurry is, what's the point of delaying a relationship with somebody who's going to bring you joy, beauty, love, kindness, compassion? Why would you want to delay such a relationship? From mankind's perspective if we embraced God truly, if we really had a desire to know God, we'd obviously want to embrace God right now as far as we're able to. But that doesn't mean we need to be impatient with ourselves about how we go about that process because we've got different injuries and emotions we need to address. We've got different belief systems that we've imbibed through the environment and these all need to be released before we can enter this relationship. And we need to patient with ourselves in terms of finding those particular problems, and releasing those particular problems. And we haven't God going up there, going, "When's Luli going to do this?" and imposing all of this will upon us. [00:25:28.17]

**Interviewer** : I do that to myself.

**AJ** : Often we do it ourselves, which is actually a mark of being unloving to ourselves, and that's also an indication that we need more of God's Love to understand that we also need to be patient with ourselves. They're beautiful qualities of love, all of them so far.

5.5. Perfection

**Interviewer** : There's another one. I think this is coming under the love category as well: perfection.

**AJ** : Yeah, perfection is very associated with beauty I feel. For most people, in terms of their definition, beauty is more often taken to be physical beauty, something that's attractive to look at and attractive to hear or listen to and attractive to see, attractive to taste and so forth. Perfection has a lot of other hallmarks to it besides beauty. It also has the hallmark of being perfect in function and form. Beauty is about the form and perfection can also be about how perfect the function is. If you look at our body, as an organism, it's a perfectly functioning system. And if we look at the body's diseases even as a perfect functioning system we can see that as our soul degrades it creates disease to tell us that our soul's degrading. So we know through this feedback system what's happening to our body. It's a perfectly functioning system, even feeding back to us moment by moment what we're doing.

**AJ** : It's also a perfectly functioning system in terms of the reception of pleasure. On the one hand we've got the pain, which is the feedback system telling us that something's out of harmony with love, and then on the other hand we've got this perfect system that gives us a lot of pleasure, through sexual pleasure, joy, peace and other qualities as well that we absorb through the process of engaging things in love. As that happens we get all of these pleasurable sensations in our body and so our body becomes not only perfectly beautiful but also perfect in how it functions, and this is a result of love as well. [00:27:36.03]

5.6. Efficiency and economy

**Interviewer** : Okay. How about efficiency?

**AJ** : Efficiency or economy, shall we call it?

**Interviewer** : Yep, that was another one further down the line, yeah.

**AJ** : Yes, these are two very, very interesting attributes of love as well.

**Interviewer** : Oh they're sub-attributes of love as well?

**AJ** : Yeah.

**Interviewer** : There's a lot of attributes of love.

**AJ** : Yeah. Because when you become more loving towards anything in your environment or even in yourself, everything that happens within you all of a sudden also becomes more efficient. In other words you don't want to waste time, either your own time or anybody else's time, or even nature's time or the environment's time. You also don't want to waste resources. Love for the resources is so strong that you only want to use them in an efficient manner. You don't want to abuse them. And you also have an internal priority system that happens as a result of this efficiency in the sense that you prioritise your life around the things that are the most important, which are all to do with Divine Love and all of those kinds of things. And you prioritise your life so that those particular things become your highest priority and everything in your life is geared towards the efficiency of changing your life into more harmony with love and truth and connecting with God in terms of the relationship with God.

**AJ** : Economy is an interesting part of efficiency in the sense that if I'm loving then I will want to get the best out of every single thing that I use, but not in what I would call a psychologically disturbing way. For example, some people want to eat all of their food even if some of their food's a bit bad. They'll cut off a bit of the bad food and eat the rest of it and things like that, whereas I feel part of economy is that all of the living things within the universe need to benefit from these particular food sources. [00:29:43.09]

**AJ** : When I see a bad piece of food, I go, "You beauty, that's great, I can feed that to my worms," and the insects will increase in number as a result. The insects will have a lot of other work that they will do, and as a result of that there's so many things that will change in my environment. So I don't see economy as just how it affects me but also how it effects the entire environment in terms of how I use these systems that I use. I need to be very careful about the choices that I make with anything that degrades the environment in any way. With anything that's going to improve the environment I need to make those economical choices immediately to improve the environment.

**AJ** : Mankind unfortunately has a focus on money, rather than economy. We often do many things that are not in harmony with economy but are in harmony with the dollar. When they're making roads, for example; we often see that the roads are made by having people at each end stopping the traffic flow. And then you have a whole long stream of vehicles all piled up in a row, all still with their engines on, all with the people sitting in the cars doing very little at all, which means that there's very little efficiency and economy. And it's all done for a road, but if the road were done at night time, for example, when there was far less traffic, or a second road was built alongside it rather than the road itself, even though it would be more expensive, it would actually be far more efficient and economical to everybody involved.

**AJ** : Unfortunately mankind is not very good at measuring all of the economies or all of the efficiencies. They only measure the efficiencies with respect to money. God doesn't do that. God's efficient right across the board with all things and all the efficiencies of God are a beautiful expression of God's Love.

5.6.1. God's efficiency in the design of the universe

**AJ** : If we look at another part of economy and efficiency, it's this aspect of how God's created the universe. God's created the universe so that all of the living things in the universe have the ability to transform the dead matter in the universe into living things. What this means is that if I build a home out of dead things, it means that all the living things in the universe are now geared to attack that dead thing, that home. [00:32:05.08]

**AJ** : I will have insects wanting to eat the wood, I'll have insects coming in, spiders making their nests and all these other things happening, and all of these things are a process of the attempt to degrade this home back into nature so that it can be re-used by something living. Every time I create something out of dead material, I am actually not demonstrating very much efficiency. God's not like that generally. What God does is create a lot of living things, and because the living things have intelligence built into them they are then also able to manage this process of turning all of the dead matter back into living matter in some way.

**AJ** : If you look what happens in a forest for example, when a tree dies and falls on the ground, it is instantly attacked, or instantly consumed but over a long period of time - by fungi, by insects, and other living organisms that cause the entire tree to totally degrade back into the environment over time so that it can be a source of food for other living things. This is the way God creates everything in the universe as well. So God is very efficient in every single creation. It's not like mankind; we are generally only efficient when money is involved, whereas God is efficient and economical with respect to love and truth. They're the primary efficiencies.

**AJ** : If we change ourselves to become more like God we will find we would leave a money-based economy in fact, and go to a different type of economy that's more based on what is the efficient and economical thing to do because that's the most loving thing to do. [00:33:53.01]

5.6.2. Abundance is a part of God's economy

**Interviewer** : A side shoot to that is abundance, because there's economy but there's also abundance.

**AJ** : Exactly, and actually I feel that abundance is a part of economy.

**AJ** : With abundance we can see that the way God creates is very different to the way we create. When we manufacture there's a lot of resources that go into something and that thing cannot generally replicate itself very easily, if at all. To replicate itself an organism needs to be alive, for a start, and secondly it generally needs to have a genetic code of some kind to replicate itself over and over again. Now God has created all of these very intricate organisms right the way to the most complex, which is the human soul itself, but in the process of creating these organisms every single living organism has the ability to provide abundance within itself.

**AJ** : For example, if you look at the very smallest of organisms, they all replicate very rapidly and they all have similar form and function. When you look at things we need to eat, for example trees or seeds of any kind or anything that provides fruit or vegetables, every single one of them firstly provides the material that we want to eat but secondly it seeds and has the genetic code for replication automatically involved. In every single thing there is automatic abundance. For example when you plant one peach tree seed it grows into a peach tree and, unless it's been genetically modified, it automatically fruits, and every one of those fruits has a seed that you can plant again, and you have another tree. And that first tree is still producing thousands of pieces of fruit every year while you plant the second one. It grows over a few years and that's now producing thousands of pieces of fruit. This is just from two seeds, one that comes from the other. [00:36:05.08]

**AJ** : That's a mark of God's feelings of abundance in the universe. Abundance can be created quite easily when you're able to create something genetically. If you can't create something genetically then abundance is very, very difficult to create of course. And then we have to use resources to create; the resources that are the output if you like of the living matter that turns everything over and changes matter around us. And then we grab those resources and produce things. Man's not very good at producing abundance. We're also not very good at understanding abundance because we do things like eating meat for example. We get a cow, we mate it with a bull; two animals are needed for that. We create a third, a calf or maybe two calves at the most. If one of those calves is a male, he will generally be slaughtered and eaten for meat. And then the other calf, if she's a female, she will generally be grown to become a milk source or something like that.

**AJ** : But if you look at the entire process, to do those two things requires a huge amount of resources around the world. This is why the rainforests in Brazil are getting cut down; it's largely because of meat production. Humankind is becoming more and more desirous of eating meat, and as a result of that we have to destroy more things to create more cattle to eat, which we are also destroying through the process. And any animal we eat can't replicate. The difference between that and what God's provided is that everything that we eat in nature generally, even after we've eaten it, can replicate, which is automatic abundance.

**AJ** : So there are a lot of things that are a part of God's nature, which are a part of love that God's provided, that can cause us to see that abundance is a big sign of love. [00:38:09.09]

6. God's creativity is a quality of God's Love and power

**Interviewer** : We haven't really talked about creativity yet, which is obviously a huge part of God.

**AJ** : Of course.

**Interviewer** : That comes under power, does it?

**AJ** : Well creativity's a combination of love and power, because it's one thing to imagine something within your creative space, but quite another to be able to produce it. You could say that the production of it is to do with what physical power you have to produce it, whereas the imagination of it comes from all different sources; creativity is a part of us but it's also a part of God's nature.

**AJ** : You can see creativity is part of God's nature if you look at the variety. When mankind sees something new and different, we go, "Wow, that was pretty unusual," but if you look through nature, everything is new and different, everything you look at. And this is a part of God's nature, how God creates in this very creative multi-functional way. Every single thing that God creates has multiple purposes, it's not just limited to one thing. Most of the things we create are limited to a few purposes but when we find something that we create that has many purposes most of the time that particular thing grows exponentially in terms of its sales. Look at what's happened to the iPhone or the iPad or those kinds of things that have multiple purposes. They have often grown much more rapidly than other devices that we create that are for single purposes. [00:39:47.04]

6.1. God creates everything in harmony with Her Laws

**Interviewer** : I think you've said one time that God creates just by the power of intention and it automatically manifests.

**AJ** : That's oversimplifying it perhaps, but it is true that God has the ability to imagine within Herself and then automatically whatever is imagined comes into being, and that thing that comes into being is automatically in harmony with all of the laws and principles of the universe. That's a pretty amazing process or quality of God I feel; the ability to be able to create and yet everything that God creates automatically lives in harmony with all the rest of the creations that God has made, of which there are literally billions and billions and billions. In fact you could almost say it's an infinite number of creations that God seems to have created, and yet every new creation God creates always fits in with every other creation God's created.

**AJ** : That is mainly because of the framework of laws God makes. The framework of laws is different to looking at these attributes of beauty, perfection, joy, sensitivity, patience, efficiency, economy and abundance - what I would probably call effects of love. What I feel is one of the truly amazing things about God is that God's placed a framework in which all of these other effects exist. And you could call the framework "Laws"; they're the laws of God. There is a hierarchy of laws, but the laws associated with Divine Love are the highest laws. They become the laws that govern everything. Every new thing that God imagines is automatically in harmony with the laws of Divine Love, every single new thing that God imagines and therefore calls into creation. As a result of that, it automatically fits within the framework. And that's an amazing thing.

**AJ** : With the things that man creates, such as the laws of man, for example, the copyright laws; we had to change as soon as the Internet and other forms of media arrived. Even when film and sound recording was introduced, we had to change the copyright laws for every new form of technology that was introduced. This is because the laws are so limiting that they limit what we're able to create whereas with God the laws are so all-encompassing that any new thing God creates automatically conforms itself to one or more of the laws. And therefore God doesn't have to go and make a whole new set of laws every single time God goes and creates another thing, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, because it shows you that the laws have been so well thought of that any new thing that God even imagines automatically conforms to those laws. [00:43:08.05]

**Interviewer** : It covers everything.

**AJ** : It covers everything.

6.2. How God creates human souls

**Interviewer** : It's pretty clever. How does God create our souls? I think you said a few weeks ago in the soul interview that the souls have genetic structure. Does God create our souls through a kind of replication process?

**AJ** : Well I'm still investigating the way God creates our souls. When you pass through the different dimensions of the spirit world and you enter what's called the soul union condition of the spirit world, in that condition you have the means to investigate how souls operate. Because you're now not limited by physical body eyes, and you're now not limited by your spirit body's eyes, now you can observe things with your soul's eyes, if you like, and so are able to observe what actually happens. Now at this point in time I can't remember ever seeing a new soul come into existence. That doesn't mean that God doesn't create new souls; I've just never been present when God's made one. Therefore I don't know the process that God goes through to make one.

**AJ** : However after they've come into existence I've seen many souls that are yet to incarnate. I see their basic form and their basic structure and what happens before they come to Earth or to other places in the universe to incarnate. We have the ability to see what happens after their incarnation but not yet the real ability to see what happens during their creation. That is certainly something that I believe that God desires to teach us and so that's why I feel that God does want us to learn that process of how to bring new souls into creation ourselves.

**Interviewer** : Is God still creating new souls? Or you don't know?

**AJ** : I believe so, but, if you think about the universes that I've described in previous discussions, there are many physical universes and therefore the potential of many pools of unborn souls, if you like, that are yet to incarnate. And so it makes sense that God would potentially still be creating. But again, as God has done with many other processes, a lot of these processes are probably automatic in the sense that they don't actually need God's saying, "Oh, we need twenty more souls today," but rather it's an automatic process or flow. Because if you look at everything that God has done, there is always an automatic process or flow in the creation of things. That then would tend to indicate that God Herself is automatically creating as things are incarnating; more is coming somewhere in the universe. [00:46:11.20]

6.3. How God creates in the universe

**Interviewer** : Is God creating other things? Do you know if God is still creating other universes even?

**AJ** : Yes, but it's interesting how God creates other universes; a lot of it's done with the aid of the creations that God has already created. If we look at what happens genetically and in terms of evolutionary cycles, we can see that certain things come into existence through processes that God has already created, which allows for the new thing to come into existence.

**AJ** : For example, imagine the existence of trees without insects. Now trees without insects on this planet would be very, very difficult because insects are a major part firstly of pollinating the tree, oftentimes distributing their DNA or with other animals distributing their DNA. But the insects also polish off the dead trees; they actually turn the dead trees into matter so that other living organisms including trees can survive. Without the insects you could see that the trees would have a lot of difficulty surviving. That being the case, you can see there are symbiotic relationships. So when God created a new tree, there already had to be some kinds of things that God created to support those particular things in their existence.

**AJ** : Often the way God creates is that lots of things come into existence all at once rather than one thing coming into existence at a time. When you think about it, if one thing comes into existence at one point in time without there being any supportive network for that thing to exist, then naturally it's going to die. If many things come into existence at once, then there is a supportive network for the things that come into existence and therefore a high likelihood they'll all survive. The way God creates is not just creating one thing at a time and hoping that it's going to fit into something; God's already imagined how it should all work and then through that imagination can cause, through His power, for things to come into existence as a result of the imagination. [00:48:25.16]

**Interviewer** : Right. What was I going to ask next? (Laughs) That could go in several different directions.

**AJ** : Sometimes you get so involved in these interviews.

**Interviewer** : I know! Oh dear I've lost it! (Laughs)

**AJ** : I feel a bit sorry for the interviewer sometimes because they get so involved in the response that they forget where they were in the questions. (Laughs)

7. Getting to know God's nature by developing a personal relationship with God

**Interviewer** : Do you know what desires God has other than to enjoy creation? You said when you're in the soul union state you could feel God's desires really well.

**AJ** : Yes.

**Interviewer** : Do you know what they are?

**AJ** : They're not dissimilar to our desires in many ways. They're just much more powerful and much more loving and creative. One of the reasons God has created a universe like this is that we can examine ourselves as living entities that have free will, and we can learn a lot about God in the process of examining ourselves, but the examination of ourselves has to be without injuries. In other words, we can't impose the injury system upon God because God is without injuries, but we can examine the positive qualities that we have, the positive desires and the nature we have and all of those other things that we have internally in our soul.

**AJ** : And we can say to ourselves, "Well if it exists within ourselves, God must also experience it at some level." If you look at what happens in our soul, you can see that there are many, many aspects of our life that interest us, don't we? There are some aspects of our life that we like in terms of observing. There are other aspects of our life that we want to be involved in and there are other aspects of life that we're very creative in, not only creative in terms of the literal creations that we can use our power to create, but also create in the sense that we can have a child. We can create through that process a living thing. [00:50:27.07]

**AJ** : We're also able to take genetic code that God has manufactured and be creative with that genetic code as well. We're able to, you know, plant a seed for example and became creative through the usage of all the things that God has given us. If you look at it we have a lot of different areas in which we express our creativity. We express our joy, we have our pleasure, we have our fascination, we have our areas of investigation and all these other aspects. And all of these qualities must have come from somewhere for them to exist in us. And I believe that God has all of these qualities as a part of Her nature as well.

**AJ** : God is fascinated with things. God is creative. God has imagination. God has joy. God has sexual joy. God has, as well as physical joy and peace-related joy, emotional joy. All of these different things or qualities, you could say, or emotions, are a part of God's nature. What we observe in ourselves in a pure state is certainly a part of God's nature as well. We can assume many things about God as a result of that and then we can investigate whether our assumptions are correct. We can say, "Well, let's assume that the best part of my nature is that I love, so let's now assume that God loves but loves better than I do."

**AJ** : Another part of my nature that I really enjoy is expressing my creativity, so let's assume that God has creativity but is far more creative and powerful with it than I am. And we can analyse ourselves and what our pure nature is and we can then say, "Okay, well let's make some assumptions that God is like that." But the only way we're ever going to know whether God's like that is to actually experience this personal relationship that I described last week in the interview and then we'll start to absorb some of that nature of God and then we'll realise that God is like that. And not only realise, we'll also experience God being like that, which is different to assuming that God is like that.

**AJ** : And this is where it requires the personal relationship.

**AJ** : You see, it's one thing to answer all these questions about God's nature, but we're never really going to feel any of these things about God's nature until we actually experience God Herself by actually entering a relationship. It's like I can see you on a television show, and I can make a heap of assumptions about your nature from that show; many of them could be incorrect and some of them could be correct. I can make a lot of assumptions about your nature, and I could write down all of those things. That tells me "Luli" but I've still never experienced Luli. So I still don't really know, do I? I don't know what Luli is like. [00:53:22.01]

**AJ** : I often see this happening with respect to Mary and me. There are many people who see us on video or hear our words or whatever, but because they've never had a personal interaction with us, they don't really know us yet. They don't really know what we're like. They're making a lot of presumptions or assumptions about our nature. And many of those assumptions or presumptions might be incorrect. It's only by engaging the personal relationship that you work out which one of those assumptions were correct and which ones of those assumptions are incorrect. And because you handle our email line coming in you often see many assumptions made about myself and Mary that you personally know are totally incorrect because you've spent some time in our company, just as I've spent some time in your company so I know that many of the assumptions that other people make about you are either correct or incorrect based on my personal experience of you.

**AJ** : It's the same with God. What we need to understand is that we need to have a personal experience with God before we're going to know whether any assumption or presumption that we have about God is true. We can discuss God's nature and characteristics and qualities; however the discussion itself is really in a way wasted unless we're prepared to have the personal experience of entering into a relationship with God to find out whether those assumptions or presumptions are correct or not. My recommendation to every single person on the planet is to not assume that you know somebody without having some kind of personal relationship with them. And even then be careful because many times you're judging them through your own unhealed and unloving nature rather than your healed loving nature.

**AJ** : What God is teaching us to do once we have the personal experience of engaging this interaction with God, because God does not have any unloving or untruthful parts of Her Nature, whenever I'm not experiencing God I know that it must be me. I know that there must be something wrong, or something that's going on inside of me that causes a block in the relationship because I know that God would never block the relationship. Once I start understanding that I can have a personal experience with God I start understanding that any time I'm blocked in that personal experience it has to be something to do with love that I need to correct inside of me, or with truth that I need to correct inside of me, or with humility that I need to correct inside of me that is causing the blockage. [00:56:09.13]

**AJ** : Once I release this blockage I can re-establish the relationship and if you think about it that way, we can then enter this personal experience with God and therefore come to know every one of God's qualities, not as an assumption that we think that God's like this, but rather as a personal experience that we know God's like that because that's the way God's treated me. I can say, for example, many of the things we've already discussed because I know the way God's treated me and therefore I know that God's nature and qualities are like what I'm explaining.

7.1. God is not angry or wrathful

**AJ** : I know that God has no anger or rage in Her. None whatsoever. All of the Bible's depictions of a wrathful angry God coming to destroy the wicked at some point in the future, for example, which is the hope of many Christians, are not ever going to be fulfilled because God does not have an angry nature. It's impossible for God to do such a thing in wrath. I know that because I've had a personal experience with God where many times God could have been angry with me and has not been, so I know that God is only loving in Her treatment of me. Through that personal experience, I get to feel, you see, and then in that personal experience if I assume God's going to treat me angrily, then I know that there's got to be something inside of me that is causing that assumption because that's not a part of God's nature, and in fact it doesn't make any logical sense that it's even part of God's nature.

**AJ** : But I can assume that God's nature is loving and at the same time feel that it's not. That's because I've yet to release my own emotional baggage maybe about my parents and how my parents treated me. Again, I need to have a personal experience with God directly, not impose my parents' belief systems which have now entered me onto my relationship with God, assuming that God is all those things my parents have taught me, without having a personal relationship. I feel that it is really important to take away this idea of personal experience from a discussion about God's attributes and qualities,. One of God's primary attributes of love is that She wants us to have a personal experience with her. He wants us to be able to express ourselves to Him and express Himself to us and to have a relationship that is going to withstand time and therefore be able to be developed over a period of time. We can only achieve that by having a personal experience. [00:58:50.01]

8. God's Sexuality

**Interviewer** : You mentioned He and She a few times there, and one thing we didn't cover last week at all are the masculine and feminine sides of God.

**AJ** : Exactly, what appears to be from a sexual perspective a dual nature. Could we call it the sexuality of God? The sexuality of God is also what God has created in the combined human soul with the male part and the female part of the soul, of which there may be varying quantities. You may have a soul that has a large male and a smaller female part, for example, or you may have a soul that has a small male part and a large female part. That doesn't mean it splits into a male and female, it means that when it splits, it might split in a way that there'll be a dominant male side and a less dominant male side but both will be male. And it might split in a way where there would be a dominant female side and a less dominant male side in each half of the soul. Or it might split in a way that there is a dominant male part and a dominant female part in each half of the soul with a little bit of masculinity and femininity in both. But how it splits determines sexuality.

Human souls are created with different amounts of masculinity and femininity, and they can split with different proportions of sexual gender upon incarnation

8.1. Humans reflect the male and female attributes of God through the different genders

**AJ** : Now let's go back to God. If God is teaching us, by making us in God's image, then it would make sense from that discussion that God obviously has masculine parts of His nature and God also has feminine part of Her nature. When I refer to God oftentimes I'll refer to the masculine or the feminine parts of God's nature. For example I see love, particularly the nurturing part of love, to be a very feminine part of God's nature but love is also a masculine quality and so unfortunately today on Earth I see many distortions. There are many females on Earth who believe that men are not capable of love, for example. And there are many men on Earth who feel that women are not capable of truth, for example, and yet both qualities are available to both halves of the soul. Therefore both qualities are available to God as well. I also feel because of all of these things that God does have sexuality. If you think about all creation: all creation generally comes from a process that involves sexuality, in other words a process of the merging of the two halves. This, I feel, tells us a lot about God in the sense that there's a merging of God's masculine and feminine characteristics in order to create. And there are different effects from each part of those masculine and feminine characteristics; the masculine characteristics having certain types of forms, and the feminine characteristics having certain types of forms. [01:02:15.09]

**AJ** : Many times you see this playing out in today's society, even in an impure way, but sometimes you can see it's quite pure as well. For example you see a lot of women enhancing the creation that a man creates. In other words a man might build a house, but he's usually not very interested in putting curtains up or any other thing like that; that seems to be a more feminine trait. There's a saying that we have: a man builds a house, a woman turns it into a home, and those kinds of traits or qualities that are a part of the woman's nature are also, I believe, a part of God's nature. And part of the man's desire is to create the external shell, the structure, and I feel that that's a part of God's masculine nature as well; to create the structure, for example the laws, that allow for things to be filled up inside of it.

8.1.1. The merging of male and female parts in man or in God is involved in creation

**AJ** : It's those two halves, which I don't feel are separate in God, they are just two parts of God's single soul, that merge during the process of creation. That's what I term God's sexuality. God does not wish to have sex with her creations, just like you, if you were married and had a child, wouldn't desire to have sex with one of your children unless you had some kind of emotional problem. The reality is that these people who believe that God is sexually involved with Her creations are not correct. God is sexually involved with Herself and Himself due to the process of creation. And God has created us to be sexually involved with the other half of our soul in the same manner, where we're sexually involved with ourselves but no other part of creation.

**AJ** : We create life through the process of being sexually involved with each other; for example the creation of a baby at the time of conception. That's a beautiful example of how the merging of two intentions and two loves come together to create, if it's done in a pure manner. My belief is that it's exactly the same with God and that's my experience as well. Living matter and living things are created through this merging of the two halves.

**AJ** : I feel that this aspect of masculine qualities and feminine qualities is something that is highly overlooked on the Earth with regard to God's nature, but I feel it's an essential and key part of God's nature and qualities. [01:05:07.15]

**Interviewer** : Are there certain aspects that are entirely masculine and certain aspects that are entirely feminine in God?

**AJ** : Certainly.

**Interviewer** : And then if we grow in Divine Love, can I still absorb the masculine aspects and just express them in a feminine way and you can absorb them and express them in a masculine way?

**AJ** : Yes. Remember that each of us has a little bit of femininity or masculinity in us no matter what our underlying dominant quality is. We would definitely be able to express some of those qualities in different ways. However my feelings are that God created the female half of the soul to reflect the female half of God's soul in a dominant way and God created the masculine half of the soul to reflect in a dominant way the masculine half of God's soul. In the end that is what we're capable of performing. Of course we do this with very different personalities, which is a different part. All of us have sexuality, and personality is separate to sexuality in the sense of how sexuality is expressed. But it has to be expressed within the laws of love because remember the Laws of Divine Love are the highest laws of the universe, and then the Laws of Natural Love are under the laws of Divine Love.

**AJ** : That being the case, how I express my personality and my sexuality, when it's in harmony with love, will cause me no pain whatsoever. When I express my sexuality and personality out of harmony with love it will cause me and potentially other people and other things in the universe a great deal of harm. And this is part of God telling us too about Her nature; She only creates out of love, She doesn't have creations that are in disharmony with love. Otherwise if God did, She'd be in immense pain and the fact is that God is in no pain whatsoever. [01:07:11.13]

8.2. Experiencing God's masculine and feminine qualities

**Interviewer** : In your relationship with God you feel certain aspects are more feminine or masculine, and through that relationship with God, when you experience a certain attribute of God, you experience it with a feminine flavour or a masculine flavour?

**AJ** : Yeah. Remember the experience of God is different to God's nature. For example God has a perfect interblending of masculine and feminine qualities. Most people are one half of the soul, currently separated from the other half of their soul. If the male half of the soul experiences God, this half of the soul is capable of having a relationship with both the feminine and the masculine parts of God, but that doesn't mean that this half of the soul will become more feminine in the process; it's just having an experience of something external to itself. The female half of the soul is also capable of having a relationship with the feminine and the masculine parts of God, but it doesn't mean that the primary part of its nature will change as a result because it's God's nature being expressed to it, not its nature.

Each half of a human soul (below) is able to have a relationship with both the feminine and masculine parts of God (top)

**AJ** : In other words, what will happen is that when we enter a relationship with God, sometimes we'll feel certain things from God that definitely feel feminine. It won't make me more feminine as a result of feeling it. I am going to retain my degree of masculinity and femininity that I have as an interblending within my soul for the rest of my existence until I become at one with my soulmate. Once I become at one with my soulmate, we are one and therefore we feel in the way God feels. We feel together. The combined soul can now have a relationship with God's soul as a complete entity once that occurs. This is the soul union state, where we're now experiencing God together.

The soul in a soul union state has a relationship with God's soul as a complete entity

**AJ** : When most people on Earth and in the spirit world begin to experience God at this point in time, they are not experiencing God together. They are experiencing God as the half of the soul experiencing God. As a result of that, they will feel the feminine half of God and they'll feel the masculine half of God as separate feelings entering them. Potentially even when we're in the soul union state, we can feel the feminine half of God expressing something to us and we'll feel the masculine half of God expressing something to us; we'll still be able to do that. But because we are now one, we feel it together, not separate to the other half of ourselves.

**AJ** : We don't need to be afraid if we're a male, for example, that if we experience God and we experience the feminine side of God that somehow that will make us more female, because it will not. And we don't have be worried if we're a female that if we experience the masculine half of God that somehow that's going to make us more male, because it will not.

8.2.1. Misconceptions about masculinity and femininity on Earth

**AJ** : A lot of times on Earth the qualities that are attributed to masculinity and femininity are not. For example, many women believe gentleness is a feminine quality, and it's not. It's a quality of love; it's not a quality that's assigned to gender or sexuality. If I become more loving, I'll become more gentle. A lot of women on the planet believe that sensitivity, in particular emotional sensitivity, is a sign of femininity, and it's not. Emotional sensitivity is a sign of love; as we become more loving we become more sensitive and that's a sign of love. Some of these qualities that we believe are masculine in nature and feminine in nature are often not masculine or feminine, they're just our expression of our own injuries in fact.

**AJ** : Often when people come up to talk to me or Mary they'll say things like, "Oh I just feel you need to become more feminine in the way you do things." And I go, "Well how can I become more feminine when I'm a male, for a start, and secondly what do you classify as more feminine?" "Oh I just feel that you need to be more gentle with the way you say things to people." "Okay, very interesting, so you believe when I'm truthful and direct that that's not gentle for a start? And then you believe, because I'm truthful and direct that that's a masculine quality and not a feminine one?" However you'll find out that God is, on the feminine side, very truthful and direct. Once you connect with the feminine side of God, you will realise in fact that She is just as direct and blunt as the masculine side of God is, and just as conforming to law as the masculine side of God is. This is a misinterpretation of the aspects of femininity and masculinity that happen on Earth.

**AJ** : Because on Earth we have so much distortion about masculinity and femininity we then push those distortions onto God rather than just clearing ourselves of these distortions and allowing God to teach us about Her nature through the experience. Again, it always gets back to the experience. If I can experience the masculine side of God and I cannot experience the feminine side of God then that tells me that I'm blocked to experiencing the feminine side of God. It's not that the feminine side of God doesn't wish to talk to me or the feminine side of God has a certain nature; it just tells me that I'm blocked. If I'm a woman and I can't connect to the masculine side of God then that tells me that I have the blockage because the masculine side of God certainly wants to connect with me and that's a part of God's nature at all times. And so I need to go through the experience of releasing from myself the blockages to each half. And remember when I use the term "half" I'm talking here more in a metaphorical or an allegorical sense of God's nature because God is one soul who has masculinity and femininity perfectly expressed in that soul. If I can only connect to the masculinity perfectly expressed but I can't connect to the femininity perfectly expressed, then that tells me that I have blockages inside of myself that prevent me from doing so. It's not God that has blockages inside of Herself preventing Her from doing so. [01:13:47.05]

**Interviewer** : Is it harder for people to connect to the feminine side because of the lack Divine femininity that's ever been on the Earth?

**AJ** : Yes it is, but it's also difficult for people to connect to the masculine side of God because masculinity on Earth has been highly distorted as well. For example, what we absorb from our environment is what we then believe about God most of the time. Unless we go through a process of just rubbing out what we've absorbed from the environment and let God express Herself or Himself to us, we will continue to retain these viewpoints about God that we then push upon God. What finishes up happening is that I believe the masculine side of God to be like my environment has defined masculinity to be and I believe the feminine side of God to be what the environment has defined femininity to be.

**AJ** : Unfortunately there are positives and negatives to both of those definitions. For example, many people believe masculinity to be strong and powerful and God's masculine nature is also strong and powerful. But many people believe strength and power can be exercised without any love and gentleness, and they believe that love and gentleness is the feminine side of the power. That is not correct. The masculine side of God is perfectly able to express love and power in a gentle way without femininity. It's our absorption from our environment of this belief that men are generally emotionally harsher than women that we then impose upon God. But it's not true that men are harsher than women; it's just an absorption from our environment. Men have the capacity to be as sensitive emotionally as women do, and as a result we have the ability to connect to both sides of God. On the planet we finish up thinking that true femininity is the way it currently exists on the planet and true masculinity is the way it exists on the planet. And these are very bad assumptions. When I say bad assumptions, they're inaccurate but they also cause us not to have an open mind and allow God to teach us what femininity or masculinity actually is. [01:16:10.18]

**AJ** : Many of us also have a lot of definitions about one of those natures of sexuality. For example with femininity, a lot of men believe that femininity is weak. Why do they believe that? Because through their environment they see women crying, they have judgement of women crying. They feel that the way that women act is based on fear, and they have a judgement of fear. They don't see that fear in women is created by them a lot of the time, for example. They don't see the creation of the fear, they just see it exists in a woman and they see that the woman is expressing her fear many times. And they see that as weak.

**AJ** : They then assume that the feminine side of God must be fearful, and that's not true, and the feminine side of God must be emotionally unstable, and that's not true either. And when women look at men, they go, "Oh he's only logical, he doesn't connect with me emotionally. He'll do things if I just tell him what to do but he won't really feel about them much." That's also inaccurate and those women are going to impose those beliefs upon God and believe that that's the way God is with them. But that would also be inaccurate because God has totally different feelings for them than that, both on the masculine side and the feminine side. We've got to be very careful with masculinity and femininity, that we don't judge God through eyes which have been distorted through our environmental experience. [01:17:43.14]

**Interviewer** : This is why we can only really come to know God when we've got rid of all of those distortions from us?

**AJ** : Yes, and through the experience of God. And this is why I keep saying to people, and I said it right from the time I was in the first century as well, that without this personal experience of God, it is impossible for us to truly come to know God. We can talk about God all the time and still never know God except through the personal experience. And unless you are willing to engage the personal experience, you're never going to discover the nature of God. You can talk about the nature and attribute certain things to God's nature, but never know for certain those things about God's nature without actually having the personal experience.

9. God's attribute of being infinite

9.1. Difficulties in measuring change in God due to the infinite difference in condition between mankind and God

**Interviewer** : Last week we talked about God changing and growing. During your 2000 years, have you noticed God changing? Has there been a noticeable change for you in that time?

**AJ** : Well I believe that it's very, very hard for me to measure whether God has changed much because God is infinite in nature. Let's assume infinite is a measure; from a scale from zero to ten (and obviously that doesn't make much sense from a mathematical perspective but for the purpose of illustration), if infinity is ten, I see myself right now as being just above zero.

**AJ** : Now in that space of being just above zero, in terms of my nature, it is going to be very, very difficult for me to measure what's happening to the changes in God. I am down here, so overwhelmed with the changes that are happening within myself, all the way through my 2000 years of experience, that it's very, very difficult for me then to go, "Well how would it feel being God and changing?" at the same time.

AJ views himself as just above zero in comparison to God's infinite nature

**AJ** : At the moment my soul does not have the capacity to absorb the changes that are in God and even to measure them because of the difference in our condition. The difference in our condition is so large as to be infinite and as a result of that it is very, very difficult for me to measure God's changes when I am just above 0. So in response to your question, it does not feel like God's nature has changed much to me. And the reason it doesn't is that I'm totally overwhelmed by every little new connection I get with God that I cannot, as a result, measure the changes that are in God.

**AJ** : I find that a lot of people try to examine God through intellectual eyes. Now I can assume, based on my experience of the universe and what changes are happening to me and what changes are happening to the universe that I observe, that God's nature is changing. I feel that is a valid assumption. But in terms of measuring how much it has, and to actually feel how much it has, that is very difficult when I'm just above zero in terms of my own development in relationship to God's development. [01:21:09.13]

9.2. Milestones in discovering God's infinite nature

**Interviewer** : I gather you would feel then you've only just discovered above zero of God's nature as well?

**AJ** : I believe so, yes. I believe that there are certain milestones in your progression when you discover bits and pieces about God's nature. I may have listed some of them in last week's discussion or in a previous discussion, but if we look at the milestones again:

9.2.1. Incarnation

**AJ** : There's basically the initial moment of conception; that's a milestone because at that moment the soul has actually incarnated. From the moment that incarnation has occurred the soul is able to have a conscious experience of the universe that it exists in, and a conscious experience of itself. So that is a milestone. It is a very, very important milestone, an essential milestone to every soul ever coming into existence. Many souls are yet to experience incarnation, by the way; they live in the soul world waiting for the experience to occur. But once incarnation occurs, this process of incarnation is a defining point in our existence. From that moment on we're starting to experience, and it's even possible from that moment on to start to experience God's nature if our parents are connected to God. So we can start this process of experiencing God. If we had people on Earth who were receiving Divine Love and they have a child, then the child themselves can also, through that experience, start to feel part of God's nature from the moment of conception onwards. So that's a milestone.

9.2.2. At-onement with God

**AJ** : You could say the next milestone, in terms of the soul's progression, is at-onement with God. Now this is the milestone of the transition between the 7th and the 8th dimensions and it's the milestone that a half of the soul undertakes. One half of the soul that undertakes it first. For the first milestone, incarnation (at conception), both halves of the soul must incarnate; that has to occur twice. At at-onement, two parts of the soul have to go through that transition, and in the transition between incarnation and at-onement I'm going to learn quite a large amount about God.

9.2.3. Soul union

**AJ** : And then there is soul union, the process of the two separate halves of the soul becoming one. That is another time of a major milestone in the soul's transition, and two halves of the soul must allow themselves and have the desire to go through that transition. [01:24:17.21]

The major milestones of soul progression

**AJ** : There are two halves of the soul going through each transition. They are the major transitions in the life of the soul. Now most living people experience that incarnation. In terms of percentages very few people experience at-onement, and no person aside from myself in the first century have experienced that on Earth, in comparison with the total amount of people who have ever incarnated. And as yet very few souls have experienced the soul union state. But I view soul union state as just above zero on the scale to God.

The soul union state is just above zero in comparison to the infinite nature of God

**AJ** : Who knows what other transitions God has? In this soul union state I am now capable of absorbing far more of God's nature, far more of God's attributes and qualities, understanding far more of how God interacts with the universe and so forth, than I was when I reached at-onement. And when I reached at-onement, I was capable of understanding far more about the qualities of God, the nature and personality of God and all of those other things than when I incarnated. That makes sense of course; that is a part of our growth. But I have also got to consider that if God is infinite then it means there may be an infinite number of these transitions that my soul needs to make.

**AJ** : Therefore I am trying to project the future now; these are the points of discovery that I am trying to engage myself in. Every little state that I find myself in, I find myself understanding there is more to understand. And most people find that through their life.

**AJ** : Now imagine if there is an infinite God and I am at this point, just above zero, having undertaken the first three milestones in soul progression. That is where I am in understanding God's infinite nature and infinite qualities and infinite attributes and infinite imagination and so forth. When I look at that I go, "Hmm, there's not much I understand yet." While it might look a lot from other people's perspectives, it is still not very much. And that also helps me remain humble of course because I can see, "Wow, there is still a lot for me to find out about." And who knows how many other transitions I am going to have to go through to even approach knowing some of these things about God that I feel I want to know? [01:27:15.15]

9.3. Discovering God's infinite personality and attributes

**Interviewer** : We were talking about the personality of God and being put into different souls as a unique attribute. So in the same way you would have to meet every single soul in the universe...

**AJ** : Eventually, I feel, yes.

**Interviewer** : ... to see that expression of God?

**AJ** : Yes I feel that if I ever get to point where I've met every single soul in the universe, and that is not in this universe only, but in all universes that God has created potentially, then I will have a very much better understanding of God's nature than I currently do.

**Interviewer** : Could it be that as God is changing God is creating new souls with these new attributes?

**AJ** : Yes. That is also possible. And therefore I would have to meet them as well to truly understand. (Laughs)

**Interviewer** : You're going to be busy.

**AJ** : Yes. Can you see how you have to be quite busy in terms of your desire to understand God if you want to go through that process? This is the reason why I said in the first century, "If I cannot love my brother, who I can see, then how can I love God, who I cannot see?" because in every single one of my brothers and sisters there is a quality or an attribute that I need to see to understand God better.

10. God's attributes of being childlike

**Interviewer** : Right, well I've got more lists from before.

**AJ** : Yes, let's proceed.

**Interviewer** : Okay. Well there are a bunch of attributes that surround being quite childlike in terms of playfulness and spontaneity.

**AJ** : Yes, let's list them. It's good to list the actual qualities of what it's like to be childlike, because it doesn't mean to be a child. For instance a child has a very, very little understanding of its environment, it has very little experience. We can be adults with very, very long experiences and very large understandings of our environment and still be childlike. So let's look at this. Spontaneity...

**AJ** : What else did you mention? [01:29:37.20]

**Interviewer** : Playfulness.

**AJ** : Playfulness, yes.

**Interviewer** : That was it actually under the childlike bits.

**AJ** : Yes. Any others you can think of?

**Interviewer** : No. (Laughs)

**AJ** : Not at the moment.

**Interviewer** : Not at the moment.

**AJ** : Not under pressure.

**Interviewer** : No. (Laughs) Not with a camera pointed at me!

**AJ** : (Laughs) Exactly. You could look at those qualities of spontaneity, playfulness, and one other quality that I can think of that is very childlike is "being fully absorbed." Generally when a child is doing something, it's not distracted very easily by other things. It's fully absorbed in what it's doing. Part of this being fully absorbed in its environment is that it understands its environment through the experience. And there are many other things we could list there but let's start with those three.

**AJ** : Yes, each one of these things is a part of God's qualities; spontaneity certainly, is part of God's qualities. I've experienced spontaneity where God has instantly desired for something to occur and I've not known about it before that point in time and I could feel instantly, "Oh, God wants that to happen," so off I go and usually try to be involved in whatever that was.

**AJ** : Playfulness, yes definitely. God has very large feelings of playfulness in terms of desire to be playful, not only with all of His creatures, but the universe itself and in fact the whole process of God using Her imagination is playful. If you look at most of the creatures that we see on the Earth you can understand that playfulness is involved in the process of creativity because God obviously had a lot of playfulness in the creations of many of these things that we see around us.

**AJ** : God is also fully absorbed in everything. God does not have moments of distraction. In other words God doesn't go, "What were you saying?" (Laughs) God is fully absorbed in the moment in the particular thing God is doing. And because God has the ability to have so many things happening at the same time, God is actually absorbed in every one of them at the same time to the full extent. And that's something that we eventually come to do in time. In other words, in time you will be able to have a conversation with many people at the same time, hear them in response, and you will be fully absorbed in every conversation. You won't have, "Oh that one's Joe Blow over there, I don't like him very much so I'll be partially absorbed with him. I'll just be present." God doesn't do that and neither does a person who becomes at-one with God, where you're not just present without being involved.

**AJ** : And being involved is another part of the childlike quality. Children generally are not fearful of involvement. The only fear they contain generally is when their parents have inculcated in them that they need to be fearful, then of course the child is automatically so. But if that hasn't happened, a child automatically wants to be involved and asks to be involved, even. That's a part of our childlike nature as well. But that is not the same as childishness. Childishness I feel is to do with a lack of development, a lack of understanding. And many adults who are eighty years of age on this planet are totally childish in the sense that they are still angry, manipulative, controlling, and all these other things, which are all unloving creations through their life, and they are not a part of their childlike nature actually. [01:33:23.10]

11. God's attribute of showing attention to detail

**Interviewer** : Okay. This may be related to being fully absorbed: attention to detail.

**AJ** : Yes. If you look at everything God has ever made, it has so many multiple roles; it has so many multiple characteristics. It is intricate in detail; even single-cell living structures are intricate in detail. Mankind still has a lot of trouble understanding how they actually operate. God gives attention to every single little tiny thing. You think of things that we just swat with our hand, like an insect or a mosquito comes along and we just swat it even without thinking, and it's gone; God felt the life of that insect disappear and return to God, in fact. And God also felt what we did in the sense of understanding what we did; God felt the action and God doesn't have any judgement about the action of course, but He felt it. He understood what happened in His universe just then. And if you look at the insect itself, what a small little creature to look at and examine, and yet the only time we generally look at a mosquito is when we're just about to hit it.

**AJ** : With God, God gave enough attention to detail with it to create it. And not only that, but to create it with a purpose. That's a part of it too. What I love is that God has created all of God's creation in intricate detail with a focus and attention on it, with an intention for that particular thing to have a purpose. And God has made every single thing so intensely intricate and there's got to be something in that about love. When you look at it, yes, love does look at the intricate involvement in things and love plans for every possible contingency as well. Love is often very, very logical. [01:35:49.10]

**Interviewer** : You would say attention to detail comes under love?

**AJ** : Certainly but it also comes under truth and power I feel. The more powerful you become the more ability you have to attend to smaller details.

**Interviewer** : Because you're not all wrapped up in the big picture?

**AJ** : You're not wrapped up in the big picture all the time and in fact you see the intricate detail and how it supports the big picture. For example when I examine the environment, I see the soil and I see the insects and I see them as primary parts of the intricate nature of what God has created. I see any living organism as having intelligence and so therefore needing to be a part of any system. And yet the average person when they think, "Oh, do you want to go and create a garden? Well let's bulldoze the place or let's dig holes here or let's push over this tree here and let's create what we want," without any attention to the soil oftentimes, and definitely not the insects. Most people just totally ignore what happens to them completely. God doesn't. God created them. God created them all for a purpose and God defined that purpose in an intricate manner. God is obviously very interested in them and interested in their purpose. And the more connected with God I become, the more interested I am in the smallest of creatures as well as the largest: the human soul. [01:37:13.09]

**Interviewer** : If God didn't show attention to details in creating the universe, something would go horribly wrong, wouldn't it?

**AJ** : Exactly! Exactly, that's the other thing when you look at the universe. A lot of people would argue that the universe has gone horribly wrong and I can't agree because all the things that I've observed going wrong have been because of what man has created, not because of what God has created. At some point mankind or womankind need to say, "Look, this is what we're creating. We're creating things that are obviously out of harmony with love, they're obviously out of harmony with creating joy and peace and happiness and in harmony with creating pain and suffering." We need to stop and we need to understand that a part of God's nature is to not do that. Any time we see ourselves creating something that's out of harmony with love, out of harmony with joy, out of harmony with beauty, out of harmony with any of the other things that we've listed as a part of God's nature, we need to go, "Hmm, yes I can see I'm out of harmony and I just need to stop. I need to stop this creation for whatever reason." The reason might be that I want to transport myself from one place to another. I need to stop these creations, you see.

**AJ** : The more in harmony I get with God, the more in harmony I will get with that place where I'll be able to learn how to do things differently and desire to learn how to do things differently so that they're all in harmony with love. [01:38:39.23]

12. God's attributes of justice and impartiality

**Interviewer** : Okay. I'll just carry on, there's a few more on the list.

**AJ** : Fire away.

**Interviewer** : Yeah there's a few more: impartiality.

**AJ** : Yes, again I feel that this is a mixed quality and the results of love and justice.

**Interviewer** : So justice is a major core attribute?

**AJ** : Yeah, I feel so. You see justice built into almost everything God has done, particularly at the human soul level. God is very, very interested in justice. The reason God is interested in justice is that God sees that when mankind creates injustice, pain and suffering are the automatic results. Everything God does is always very just. Impartiality is a part of God's justice system, as well as a part of God's Love. It makes sense that if you're going to have children you'd love them all the same and I know a lot of people on Earth don't but that doesn't mean God doesn't. And it would also make sense that you would treat them all the same. If you don't treat them all the same, you cause pain. When you examine a person on Earth who's been brought up by a parent, if he's had siblings, oftentimes those brothers and sisters have been treated differently. As a result of that, the person has a lot of pain in them generally because they can feel how differently they've been treated compared to their brothers and sisters.

**AJ** : Impartiality is an essential part of the expression of love. God doesn't love me more than God loves you. Even if there's more of God's Love in me than there is in you, it doesn't mean that God loves me more, or doesn't want to love me more. What it means is that I have accepted more; I have chosen to accept more. The reality from God's perspective is that God wants all of His children to love God and God feels love for all of His children impartially. In other words, God has just as much love available to you as God has available to me. [01:40:54.12]

13. Proportions of people in different conditions in the universe

**Interviewer** : You said before that only a few people have made it to the at-onement condition. What kind of percentage out of everybody is that?

**AJ** : If you look at the souls that I'm aware of that are surrounding the Earth and the immediate spaces surrounding the Earth in terms of multidimensional spaces, at this stage the figure comes to mind of around about sixty billion souls that I know of that have come into an incarnated phase. There are still many billions and billions of souls in an un-incarnated state, but there are around sixty billion incarnated souls at this point. Of those incarnated souls around 4%, just over two and a half billion of the souls, have come into an at-onement condition with God. And of the sixty billion on Earth and in the spirit world, around one third of those souls who have passed over, twenty billion or so are in the hells of the spirit world.

**Interviewer** : Oh dear. That's a lot.

**AJ** : Another one third of those souls are in the second dimension. The rest of the souls make up the third to the seventh dimensions. So what we are left with? About seventeen and a half billion. This is without the population of Earth. [01:43:32.21]

**Interviewer** : To me, that kind of says that something's gone wrong a bit.

**AJ** : We haven't been here long.

**Interviewer** : Haven't we?

**AJ** : No. And at-onement only began 2000 years ago.

**Interviewer** : Okay.

**AJ** : Remember it's driven by free will, and so by their own free will two and a half billion people have entered the at-onement condition. I think that's pretty good. It just depends on how you look at it. As you said earlier, God's looking at it from an infinite perspective, so God will be going, "It doesn't even matter where it is, sooner or later they're all going to find me." (Laughs) The issue from my perspective is that I want to help the people who are in the hells and the second and the third to the seventh dimension and on the Earth to embrace the process of getting into the at-onement condition, to the extreme happiness that these groups of people who are in at-onement are experiencing, which is not experienced by the others. It would be great if they could begin to experience that extreme happiness. Now I believe over the coming years this graph will change greatly. [01:44:44.04]

**Interviewer** : Is that as a result, as you said, of more Divine Love being pumped into the universe?

**AJ** : Yes but also the result of our presence on Earth, being able to deliver Divine Truth back on the Earth again without distortion. That's also a large part of it. There's a great chance of us affecting a lot of people in the long run. When I say the long run, within a few hundred years there's a great chance of affecting a lot of people in the hells and in the second dimension and helping them progress them through into these more happier states of their existence.

**Interviewer** : Would you feel that God's plan is for every one of His children to be at-one with God?

**AJ** : Yes, and also to be in the soul union state. Remember if you're impartial, you wouldn't create one set of souls to never experience one thing, if that's the underlying purpose, and another set of souls to experience another. There may be times though where a group of souls are saying "no" to God, "Look I don't want to do that," and God says, "No worries. The offer is withdrawn for a while so that you can feel the pain of that condition and at some point in the future I'll offer it again and we'll see how you feel then." Over a period of infinite time, it is impossible in fact for all of these people not to reach this state of at-onement, this state here from there onwards of at-onement.

**AJ** : Now for the soul union condition, there are only a handful of people that have actually reached that condition, and so therefore in percentage terms it's hardly anything, which is a sad case. However we're only in the beginning of the process. This is the problem on Earth, we look at things and feel like eighty years is a long time, but eighty years is not very long from God's perspective and certainly not long from the perspective of the development of your own soul. [01:46:48.15]

14. Sub-attributes of God's Love (continued)

**Interviewer** : Okay. Well I've got a few more of the attributes and then probably we'll be out of time.

**AJ** : No worries.

14.1. Nurturing

**Interviewer** : One thing I've noticed sometimes when I receive Divine Love is that there's a nurturing and protective quality to it.

**AJ** : Yes. Part of the quality of love is to nurture and if we look at that word "nurture," it's a word that sort of keeps us embraced, if you like, while we go through change. That's the whole process of nurturing. If we look at nurturing a child for example, we nurture the child so that it has the ability to change in the most rapid possible way. And part of God's nature is to continually nurture His children so that they all have the ability to change in the most rapid way. Unfortunately many of God's children also exercise their will in a negative direction, which means that the people who God is trying to nurture often don't feel very nurtured because of the attacks that they're receiving from others. But from God the quality is to be nurtured and protected. [01:48:03.17]

14.2. Helpfulness

**Interviewer** : Is helpfulness a sub-aspect of that?

**AJ** : Of course.

**Interviewer** : Being immensely helpful.

**AJ** : Yes. Of course. Any person who wishes for your improvement but also wishes for your happiness is going to try to assist you to become as happy as possible in the most rapid possible way. And therefore if you look at it from God's perspective, God wishes to be as helpful as possible. God provides everything possible that we need to be able to assimilate truth, and it's only our arrogance that causes us to reject it. It's only our arrogance that actually pushes the whole thing away, that causes us to criticise. You'll find that there will even be a group of people listening to this interview who criticise. They are being arrogant because they are not seeing God's nature and they don't even want to engage the process of seeing God's nature. So how does God help those people? Well God already has ways to help them and try to nurture them.

**AJ** : They are using their arrogance to not listen and that's fine, they're able to choose to do so, but God is already trying to engage them in other ways so that eventually God breaks through their arrogance so that they finish up listening. God is even helping the darkest of individuals, let's say what we classify on Earth as the darkest of individuals - the murderers, the rapists, the people who influence large groups of other people in a negative way - God is trying to influence them through their experience as best God is able given their condition. Remember of course that on the receiving end we need to be open to be nurtured. Open to being helped. Open to being loved. Open to being treated kindly. Open to being treated compassionately. Open. So you can see the quality of being open, wanting to have an openness to being nurtured, to being helped, to being loved, to being cared for and so forth, this is a part of our humility.

**AJ** : Openness is where most of humanity falls down while they're on Earth. They become quite arrogant; they're not open. As a result of not being open they cannot absorb qualities God is trying to give to them, that they are personally rejecting. [01:50:45.19]

To feel God's Love we need to be open to receiving it and its sub-attributes

15. Communicating with God through prayer

15.1. Prayer opens up pathways in our soul and transmits desire

**Interviewer** : When we pray for some help, how does God actually instigate the help that is then offered to us? Can God ramp up laws around us?

**AJ** : No, God doesn't change a single law, but there is a law about desires. You see when we pray, we are engaging laws that we're not otherwise engaging. One of the laws that we're engaging is to be open. There must an openness in you before something can be given to you by God. When I pray, and it's a sincere prayer driven by passion and desire inside of myself as a feeling, my soul becomes open. When my soul becomes open I have the capacity to absorb the gift that God is giving. This is the operation of prayer. Prayer does two things, not one thing. Firstly it creates a condition inside of the individual of receptiveness. It has this transforming effect on your own soul initially, of creating a condition where you're willing to accept something. In other words it actually opens you to humility. It opens you to being open to receive. Now that you're open to receive, something can be given.

**AJ** : The second thing is that it transmits what you desire to the person who's capable of giving it, God. It is also a transmission of desire. It could even be a desire that is out of harmony with love, by the way, and if that's the case it won't be answered by God because God is incapable of answering any desire out of harmony with love. But if we're transmitting a desire in harmony with love to God, why would God not want to give? When God does give, because we've already created a condition of receptivity inside of us through the process of prayer, we're going to receive. We're going to receive because the openness inside of our soul emotionally has been created.

So prayer has a multitude of effects upon our soul. And it's not the kind of prayer that most religions talk about, a prayer that comes from the mind, a rote learning of a certain type of slogan, or a series of statements that we then say over and over again. Obviously none of those kinds of prayers can open our soul so therefore those kinds of prayers do not create receptivity. And many times, although there may be a transmission of desires, because we're not already open, we will never receive anything, even if God wanted to give them. [01:54:05.21]

15.2. Particles that are transmitted during prayer

**Interviewer** : Last week you talked about the particles that travel from us to God.

**AJ** : Yes, which are emotions.

**Interviewer** : The particles are emotions as well?

**AJ** : Yeah, they are actual emotions, which are particles. They have colour, sound, taste, smell; these emotions that come out of us have got all sorts of qualities. The emotions that we transmit towards God are particles that actually exit our universe and enter God.

**Interviewer** : They're a different type of emotion than if I project an emotion at you?

**AJ** : No.

**Interviewer** : It's the same thing?

**AJ** : Same kind of thing.

**Interviewer** : But a different particle?

**AJ** : Well, no both come from me; they're the same kind of particle. It comes from me and enters another person. God has created all persons with the ability to transmit emotions towards each other and to receive them. And it can occur instantly, and as a result of that these particles are not bound by space or time. They involve our emotions, our feelings and our passions and desires. If they're in harmony with love they will create a condition of receptivity and a transmission of desire. They can also be out of harmony with love and still create a receptive condition. In other words I can have a desire to go and do something evil, and that's going to create a receptive condition in my soul to accept evil things.

**AJ** : In other words I accept that I want to create that particular thing and I'll also attract people to me who will show me how to do evil things, as a result of that desire. Naturally. Our prayer can be exercised in a negative way as well. But if we're talking about the kind of prayers God answers, then God can only answer the prayers that are directed towards God, a transmission of desire based on a pure motivation for truth or love or humility, in particular those three things, but also for justice and other parts of God's nature. We can pray for anything that's a part of God's nature to enter us, but it has to be a pure desire and we have to have an openness to the reception of it before it's going to benefit us. [01:56:30.17]

15.3. Similarities in God's Soul and our souls

**Interviewer** : When someone in the Bible, and it might have been you, I can't remember... (Laughs)

**AJ** : (Laughs) Yeah, go on.

**Interviewer** : ... said that man was made in God's image. Was that you? Or was it someone else?

**AJ** : No, it's also said in Genesis, in the book of Genesis that man was made in God's image.

**Interviewer** : Was that referring to the souls or these particles... the souls?

**AJ** : Yes.

**Interviewer** : So God is a soul. How have you discovered that?

**AJ** : I'm not saying that God's Soul is created of exactly the same matter as our soul. But the fact is that we are God's children in a pure sense and in a scientifically physics-based sense. That being the case our soul is made up of very similar particles as God's soul. The fact is that we can receive particles from God's Soul, Divine Love is one of them, and we can transmit particles to God's Soul that God receives, and our love is one of those particles. The reality is that if we can transmit particles between ourselves and God and God can transmit particles between God and ourselves, then it makes sense that there's very similar matter inside of our soul as there is inside of God's soul.

**AJ** : It doesn't mean that we have the complete set of matter inside of our soul that's inside of God's soul because God's soul is much larger and infinite in nature. But it does mean that there is a high likelihood of similar particles existing in both souls. [01:58:11.20]

15.4. Soul to soul communication

**Interviewer** : And so with us being souls, we communicate in a certain way and then you can communicate with God in the same way?

**AJ** : Yes. You know how we communicate at the moment? We have our soul, we have our spirit body which has its mind, we have our physical body which has its brain, and we have a feeling in our soul that generates a thought in our mind which is then translated to language in our brain. And then we speak it. It's a very, very inaccurate form of communication. If we could just transmit it by coming out of the soul to the other person's soul, then that would be very accurate. It doesn't have to go through intellectual analysis and it doesn't have to go through language translation and speech, and it doesn't have to go on the receiving end through a hearing device. And it doesn't have to go through the reverse translation again, which is often fraught with dangers of its own. And then back into a mind and then back into an emotion. Transmission of emotions using this method is very, very cumbersome and also not very accurate.

Communication from soul to soul is much more accurate than via the spirit body and physical bodies

**AJ** : This is why I can say many things and I'm often feeling at the same time in a person, "They have no idea what I'm saying to them because they're hearing something completely different because they're not hearing my feelings. They're hearing my words." Now with God and us, God's teaching us to hear His feelings for us. And God's teaching us that we need to have feelings for God in order to have a relationship. And in a way God's also teaching us that this is the best way for us to communicate, you and I. If you and I communicate with feelings for each other, now the feelings will be much more accurate, we'll feel the feeling rather having to interpret the feeling. And this is why you can be talking to some people and the words coming out of their mouth are all words of love and at the same you feel like you're getting attacked or you feel like you're being harmed and that's because the feelings coming out of them aren't in harmony with the words.

**AJ** : They've learnt to cut their spirit and physical bodies off, but their soul has a totally different way of feeling to what their bodies are expressing. God does not wish us to do that. God wishes us to learn how to communicate with our feelings, even if we've got to communicate them with words, so that we can actually feel each other more accurately and not base things on all of this interpretation process, which is fraught with miscommunication.

**AJ** : This is why I find many people who listen to my videos these interviews don't get to feel me unless they're open enough to stop the intellectual barrage that they get inside of themselves about what I'm saying. If they could feel me, then they could feel my sincerity. If they could feel me, then they could feel my love for them. If they could feel me, they could feel that I'm stating the truth. They could feel all of those things. But the fact is that most people are still very detuned from their feelings, and as a result of that they're also detuned from God because the only way God can transmit Her feelings to you is by you being open to feelings. That's the only way that God can transmit Her feelings for you, to you.

**AJ** : This discussion of God's attributes is a very important discussion but it is more important I believe to understand that while God has all of these attributes, I am never going to personally experience them unless I enter this experience with God. To do that I am going to have to be humble. I'm going to have to be very truthful with myself. And I am going to have to want to learn how to love. Because that is the thing God wants to teach me the most. And if I could do that, then everything will change quite rapidly in my own life and in the lives of people around me. And I feel like the attributes of God and the qualities of God are all geared to help me do that. Every one of God's attributes and qualities that I have personally felt have all been geared to help me come to terms with love, come to terms with truth, to be humble and to just be open to this process of learning how to feel everything around me, to be sensitive to everything around me. [02:02:31.05]

16. Benefits of engaging a relationship with God

**Interviewer** : As you said we've talked about all of these great attributes, but could you summarise what's the benefit of actually connecting to God? What do we get out of it?

**AJ** : Well I think the benefits have been probably been explained through the course of the interview in the sense that once I connect to God and become at-one with God, the qualities of God enter me. I become joyful all the time, not just some of the time. I become desirous all of the time, not some of the time. I become creative all of the time, not some of the time. I become spontaneous all of the time, not some of the time. And so forth. All the things God is, is what I start to become. If you think about it from that perspective, there's so much involved with that in terms of the beautiful results of having a connection with God.

**AJ** : I also become less of all the things that God is not. In other words, once I become at-one with God I'm no longer angry because God's never angry. I'm no longer sad because God's never sad. The things that are unpleasant and painful to experience in this life all disappear as a result as well. And I know it's difficult for most people on Earth to trust that and to even believe that it is possible, but it is possible, and we can trust it because God is far better in characteristics and attributes than any individual on this planet. If you think about the best individual on this planet, whoever that is, God has far more love than they do, God has far more kindness and compassion, God has far more of these attributes of truth and humility than they do. God has far more of every one of those qualities. Now if God has far more than any one of those qualities, then God's imagination of what this Earth could be is far better than any person on Earth's imagination of what it could be, even in their most positive moment.

**AJ** : Having a Pollyanna attitude or an attitude of positivity about God and God's creations and the future is, I feel, an automatic result of understanding where God is and understanding what parts of God's nature can enter me and transform me. As those parts of God's nature enter me and transform me, I will automatically become more and more of what God is; more and more kind, compassionate, understanding, just, humble, modest, and all of these other kinds of capacities, attributes and qualities that God has enter me and I become more like God.

**AJ** : And that's why in the first century I said, "You must become perfect just as your heavenly father is perfect." And as you do that, you will go through this transition of becoming more and more like God so much that not only will you personally understand God's attributes and qualities but anyone around you will also begin to understand what God's qualities must be through your interaction with them. [02:05:38.23]

**Interviewer** : Awesome. (Laughs)

**AJ** : That's good.

17. Closing Words

**Interviewer** : Thank you very much, AJ, it's been a delight.

**AJ** : Thanks, Luli, yeah.
