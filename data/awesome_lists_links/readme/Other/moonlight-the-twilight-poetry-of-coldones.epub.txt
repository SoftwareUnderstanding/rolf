Say that upon the altar of her beauty

You sacrifice your tears, your sighs,

Your heart, write till your ink be dry

And with your tears moist it again and

Frame some feeling that may discover

Such integrity!

(Two gentlemen of Verona)

PREFACE

The thought of you lying pale, cold

Your innocent smile, your warm flushing cheeks all gone

An honest simple girl killed by a hundred year old

A century ago, I should have been gone

Your eyes will not shine anymore

Your heart been stopped forever

I won't hear your honey voice anymore

I snatched your soul from you forever

On my chest, your head will no more rest

I can no more run my fingers through your delicate hair

Now I can never hold you close to my chest

To you, my love, I can no more come near

BELLA'S LULLABY

Sleep, my darling, sleep

See how beautiful is this night

After the hour of twilight

Sleep, honey, sleep

You are my life, my existence cause

Only thing that would hurt me to lose

Only one yet to touch my heart

If I had a soul, it would have been yours

Only want to see your lovely face, my eyes

My ears want to hear just your voice

So sleep, my destiny, sleep

See how beautiful is this night

I will hum to you my lullaby

Sleep, my love, sleep

Do you know the most important sound for me?

Is your distinct, pure, rhythmic heartbeat

I only want one thing to see in Alice's mind forever

That me and you are always happy together

Now I know what was the reason

Behind my being the fastest Cullen

So that when you call I am the first to help you

To miss not a single beautiful moment with you

1

My love, if I could ever sleep

Only of you I would ever dream

Can love be this strong that it,

Can make you forget everything?

To cross the non crossable limits

Can it be so divine and lively?

Can love make you defy your nature?

Is it possible that a predator

Can fall in love with its prey so deeply,

That for him the prey becomes his most important thing?

How can you live in the situation

When near your love your dominant emotion

Is to kill her, is to murder her

But when your life is nothing as compared to her

Then becomes dominant your love

On all the other emotions,

You can now live all the time with your love

Even if you have to struggle to control every second

It doesn't to you anymore matter

That you have to struggle to defy your own nature

So that you can be near that beloved one

So that you can stay with your divine one

When life gives you a forever awaited gift

2

How can you not accept it gratefully?

When to your life a meaning is finally given

Making it meaningless again, how can you think even?

When after 90 years, life gives you a single gleaming ray of hope

How can you not cage it forever in your heart, in your soul?

When you are waiting for over 90 years for one thing

And life presents before your eyes that thing for you suddenly

How can you even think of letting it go?

When doing this can kill you, can hurt you so?

After 90 years of loneliness

With your true soul mate you are blessed

How can you even think of losing her?

How can you, even for a second, stay away from her?

Can you ever dare to let go

Your only reason to smile? It just can't be so

Can someone soulless be gifted like this?

Can someone kiss without killing?

His most wanted prey?

Now on this what would you say?

Can someone put his lips to his

Most favorite wine and not drink it?

Can someone ever possibly resist

His perfect brand of heroine?

When he craves to stay

With that brand always?

How can a more than 100 year old

3

With a young girl form a bond

When he has lost his soul

And most innocent is that girl's soul?

The most pure and divine in the world

Is the precious soul of this girl

When she doesn't even know

She is really bonding with whom?

But just tell me at this moment

How can he miss the few most precious moments

For which he has waited his whole life?

When without her, he will simply go wild?

So I won't ever leave you, honey

Sleep, my Bella, sleep

How can the lion save the lamb from other lions

Who are worse than him so many times?

But I know that when more important to him than his life is his love,

When his own life is always ready to be slayed at the altar of love

When he can love the lamb with all his might

Then he can also cross any limits to save her life

Fight, till death, he will

And if he has to, he will kill

I have traveled the whole world,

It used to look so vast before you

But now my own personal world

Has shrunken to contain only you

You are my whole world to me,

Only you are everything to me

4

Not years, decades; I'll love you till eternity

Not years, decades; But I waited for you an entire century

You don't know how it has tortured me but you

Are worth all the wait that I had to go through

I wandered far and wide to know why I was living

For this I searched every corner of this planet

I was lost in a frenzy of meaningless life,

It made no sense; I was living why

I found you... I found myself... I found the meaning

Now my life makes sense to me

I just existed like a flame extinguished

Then you made me all bright and full of spirit

You revived all the desires and wishes

Buried deep inside me

Revived the deep buried humanity in me

After you I felt more human, more living

To any sort of happiness I was blind

But now with you I can see all with your eyes

I was inert to the sentiments that bonded people

But now I can feel the abstract emotions

So sleep, my life, sleep

You are the true love of me

You gave the life to me,

So sleep, darling, sleep

5

Just for you I am living

Just for you I am breathing

You look so beautiful sleeping

Like an angel I am dreaming

As long as I live

No one can harm you

Because in fact, I only live

To love you, to protect you

I will never let tears fill your eyes

I will give you happiness so divine

That you will forget all the hurts

There will be just peace in your heart

Isabella Marie Swan, I promise to love you forever

You are the only one to live in my heart ever

So sleep, my darling, sleep

See how beautiful is this night

After the hour of twilight

Sleep, honey, sleep

EDWARD CULLEN'S

STORY: TWILIGHT

"YOU ARE MY LIFE NOW''

Dying of Spanish influenza

I was in a hospital

Mom and dad, dead, ah!

There was no hope's sparkle

A doctor came over to me

An angelic face he had

With a warm smile he said to me

You are not gonna be dead

He sank his teeth into my neck

Currents of pain flowed through me

Except pain I don't remember anything back

Just screams and agony accompanied me

Thus, a century ago began my new life

My soul lost, I became one of the damned

I had been changed by Carlisle

I was the new member of the Olympic clan

7

The thirst burning my throat weakened me

I fled leaving my creator all alone

Drinking human blood strengthened me

I had become a monster on the whole

I found something strange with me

I heard all that people were thinking

Hearing their thoughts led me

To kill only those who were deserving

My life was all empty

There was no peace

I could never be happy

To hell I was destined

Tired of wandering alone

I rejoined my family

My body deprived of soul

Nothing about me was humanly

An alternative Carlisle provided

To support my existence

Only animals now I hunted

Some peace returned to my conscience

Our family expanded

We were now seven

But my heart still waited

For you; my love, my Heaven

8

I was all alone

Then the future indicated

You were coming to fill the hole

That in my heart existed

That first day, that first sight

I remember it so clearly

From you skin the perfume took flight

I was almost maddened by agony

My throat burned

I had never felt such thirst

My control was challenged

I had to get away from you first

In a single moment

I could destroy

Every single effort

Made by Carlisle

I left my family

How weak I was, while

What were you to me?

Just a weak human, so fragile

So I decided

To face you

I decided

To endure you

9

So I came back

With you I became friend

But your mind couldn't be read

So the story doesn't end

You were an angel

Next to me so delicate

Like a soap bubble

Wandering on grass blades

Then I saw the van about to crush you

I couldn't wait, I had to stop it

In my head saying, "No! Not you!"

I pushed the van away; lifted it

You always surprised me

Your thoughts so unique

They always impressed me

They made me happy

I didn't want to put you in danger

My secret I didn't want to reveal

But you deliberately came near and near

To the extent my secret I could no more keep

My secret was worked out by you

I was essentially a selfish creature

But I could never risk your soul

I could never put you in danger

10

That was the start of our forever

For a century I hadn't heard my heart beat

What do you live for, when you can live forever?

Simple; it was just you I wanted to keep

My heart was the target

Your arrow found it

Beginning of magic

Your love started

Your smile brightened my life

Your heartbeat made me sigh

Your warm, flushed cheeks, your big eyes

Your beauty made me watch you throughout the night

And so the lion fell in love with the lamb

I have left my heart with you

You gave me life when I was damned

Now I belong only to you

You have become the only thing

That would hurt me to lose

My world is only existing

Because your heartbeat is so pure.

11

EDWARD'S STORY:

NEW MOON

"I AM SO SORRY"

"Bella, you are my life now

You are the cause of my existence

Only to you my heart does bow

But there is still this restlessness

I never wanna lose control with you

No matter how hard it may be

But I am not good for you

You are wasting your life with me

I have always feared to lose you

But whenever, I look at you

I feel I am being selfish to you

I feel I am doing wrong to you

I am damned forever

I am surely destined to hell

I can want this for you? Never!

Your soul is far more precious, I can tell

With me, you are always in danger

I tried my best to protect you

12

But first James now my brother

In danger, I can no more put you

Bella, I have to leave you

I am so sorry

But still my heart only belongs to you

Everything will be alright, don't worry"

I had been thinking

All these thoughts

But I could surely

Tell you not

For then you won't let me go

You will fight to stay with me

Which is bad for you, I know

So these thoughts, to myself I will keep

"This is the last time you ever see me

It would be as if I had never existed

You won't do anything reckless, promise me

I am sorry, our fate is just twisted"

"You don't belong in my world

I don't want you,"

Ah! The biggest lie of the world

I said because I had to

13

It was unimaginably hard for me

To say such things to my life

But how quickly she believed me

As if these weren't just lies

That was the hardest thing

I had ever done, I'll ever do

That was an unforgivable sin

That I forcibly had to do

During those moments

The look on your face

Will haunt the rest of the moments

Of my existence, what a fate!

I gave her my last kiss

I quickly had to move away

Her heartbeats then, how could I miss?

Which always gave her away

Her heart was stopping

Her breathing was frantic

Inside she was breaking

I could no more take it

I quickly left the forest

Leaving her standing there all alone

Everything was gone, all of my rest

My peace, my life, on the whole

14

I had never imagined how

A little drop of blood could change our lives

But I realized it now

That was the doom of our lives

Every shred of my existence ached

The pain was unbearable

Any peace could not be gained

The loneliness was intolerable

I hoped that she would forget me

While I could never

I hoped she would move on without me

While I could never

I clearly remember that day

Of my fragile human

It was eighteenth birthday

But she craved away from fun

Her mind was always a mystery to me

She had forbidden me to give her any present

But how could I not give her a gift when for me

She was the life's most beautiful present

I had composed her a lullaby

She was the inspiration for it

In it I had promised to never say goodbye

To spend with her eternity

15

But how could I know

That the very next day

She would be standing alone

Because I could not stay

I had spent in darkness

Over 90 years of my existence

No hope, no light, no happiness

It was all beyond tolerance

I had always thought

That someone deprived of soul

Someone who with himself fought

Could have any ray of hope?

My existence was purposeless

I was a hideous monster

I was for sure destined to hell

On world I was a burden

I loathed myself

I felt angry

I hated myself

Sad for eternity

I seldom smiled

No happiness ever touched my heart

How I used to hear people's minds

The rhythmic beat of alive hearts

16

How their hearts were

Full of passion

How their souls were

With hope brightened

From life, I always ran away

There was nothing for me

I was always nothing for anyone anyway

There was nobody there for me

So why I should live

Such a hollow life?

So why I should breathe

In a world so wild?

But then you came

Like hope, like light

And you became

The core of my life

Now I found my purpose

Why I had been created

It was for your protection

Only for you I existed

I had promised myself

That I will forever love you

I will devote myself

Completely to you

17

I was trying to fulfill this promise

As hard as I could

But this incidence so easily broke my promise

A thing I never imagined to do

My initial thoughts were right

I was indeed a monster

To exist I had no right

I was completely cursed

So cursed to hurt that person

Who gave me all my happiness

So damned to leave that person

Without whom there was just emptiness

I don't know what

Life wants from me

Why it gave me love

When happiness is forbidden for me?

But I don't care about myself

I just care about you, Bella

Life isn't fair, why? I cannot tell

But what I have done to you is completely unfair, Bella

I can never forgive myself

In the very first place

I should have stopped myself

On that first day

18

I don't know why

I couldn't resist, Bella

I don't know why

I couldn't stop myself, Bella

I knew I was dangerous

I knew I was bad for you

I knew I was cursed

I shouldn't have come to you

But I badly craved

For your company

I badly cared

About your safety

When your weren't in sight

I used to become utterly anxious

I just couldn't think right

When you were not near

I always feared

That you will get hurt

Whenever you were near

Peace drowned my heart

I fell in love with you, Bella

I don't know when

I couldn't stay away from you, Bella

All my rules, I had broken

19

Your warmth, your smile

Your fragrance

Sweetened my life;

My existence

I just wanted to live

Every moment with you

And after your life would end

I would kill myself, too

But see our fate, Bella

After all my promises

That I made to you, Bella

I shattered your heart to pieces

That last look that I saw on your face

In that damn wild forest

Will haunt me forever, alas!

Will take away all my rest

How would you endure this, Bella?

I have shattered you to pieces

I know you always wanted one thing, Bella

To spend every waking hour with me

You were most afraid

That I would leave you one day

I was helpless because that

Was inevitable on that unfortunate day

20

I know you loved me

The way I never deserved

I hope you will learn to hate me

Because this is what I really deserve

I have read Jacob's mind, Bella

He will take good care of you

But I will always be there, Bella

In shadows, waiting, ready to protect you

Humans have this great blessing

The power of oblivion

You may one day forget me

Your past; I will become

But I will suffer forever

With fresh pain everyday

Because your memories can dim? Never!

Instead they become sharper everyday

The sound of your heart beat

Is most significant sound for me

And to pass time without hearing it

Is sucking the life out of me

I am sorry, I was weak, Bella

I should never have come near you

But you are strong, my love Bella

You will move on, I hope for you

21

I miss every moment spent with you

Our taking classes together

Sitting in cafeteria with you

Why couldn't these moments last forever?

Driving you home in my Volvo

Sneaking into your room

Through your opened window

Why did this all end so soon?

Your laughter, your bright smile

Your voice, your fragrance, your heartbeat

Your honest eyes, your inability to lie

It's only you every moment, anywhere I see

Humming to you my lullaby

Watching you talk in your sleep

You used to call my name, in a way so lovely

A way to live without all this, I just cannot see

An eternity has passed since

I last held you in my arms

Since last our lips locked in kiss

How sweet were those lovely hours

You know what

I would trade absolutely anything

To become a human

And live with you, honey

22

Someone take away from me

My strength, my beauty, my immortality

I want nothing of this for me

I just want to spend with you eternity

There is autumn in our little meadow, Bella

My house is silent like coffin without you

I have become intolerably hollow, Bella

I have lost everything since I left you

My heart hadn't beat for over 90 years

But this time it was entirely different

Hollow, like it had never been there

My everything with you, I had left

I am the most loath able creature

In this entire universe

I hurt the one who gave me life, who was my redeemer

Any crime cannot be any more worse

Time will pass for both of us

Though it is passing slowly

It is passing for even me, love

Who is not even alive truly

.

.

23

What are you thinking? Rose...

What are these pictures in your mind?

When did Alice saw this? Rose

This can't be, I must be losing my mind

Rose, stop! Don't say these words out loud!

This can't be; she had promised me

She can't give her promise such wound

She jumped off a cliff? Don't tell me!

I just can't believe it, Bella

How could you do this!

When you had promised me, Bella

I couldn't even imagine this

I only had a least bit

Of satisfaction remaining in my heart

That you were safe, alive without me

Although I had broken your heart

That I was breathing in the same air

That you were breathing in, love

Now you have gone to Heaven and here

I will now go to hell, my love

I don't know how farther apart

Hell and Heaven are from each other

But I assure you that in my heart

I will keep you forever

24

Oh! Can't I go into past

And change everything

The decision to leave you in my past

Had caused this everything

Shall I get to go back

I will never ever leave you

I will take my words back

Said in the forest to you

My decision worked out, sadly

Neither for you nor for me

Everything turned on badly

On both you and me

Had you been alive

I know I would have returned

Someday, somehow, some night

Through your window you always leave opened

I would have begged you

To reaccept me

I would have begged you

To marry me

I know you would never

Ever forgive me

But to live with you forever

Was the perfect Heaven for me

25

But now nothing can be done, nothing!

I am sorry, Carlisle, forgive me, Esme

That like this my life is ending

But there is no other way, to survive this news for me

Isn't it possible that Alice might be wrong

I should once ask Charlie about it

"Hello, Is Charlie at home?" I asked on phone

There was Jacob on the other side of it

"No, he is not. He is at the funeral."

And the line on my side was cut

Charlie was on my beloved's funeral

Now alas! Alice's vision was confirmed

My love wasn't breathing anymore

I must stop my breathing too

I can't take in that air anymore

Which is deprived of her life's proof

In the plane there were humans

Some going to their homes, some leaving them

Half were excited, half sadness-laden

But not even nearly as empty as me was any of them

Because I was again that lonely person

That I was before, only more worse

Because I was that unfortunate person

Who had lost with his own hands his love

26

I so very clearly remember that day

When I had first told you about the Volturi

You were so scared by my same planning as was of today

Only then James was about to kill you and now you were killed by me.

You had forbidden me to think

Any such idea again

But now inevitable it is

For death, I can no more wait

Only one image is stuck in my mind

Trembling, shaking, breathing frantically, helpless you

When I had told you that you weren't anymore mine

How severely and brutally I must have tortured you

I can't say in words the torture, the pain I had felt

When I was forced to say those cruel, hollow words to you

But I am a vampire, you are human, I can't tell

Who was in more pain, may be in same, both me and you

I should never have been saved

When I was destined to give

To my beloved the worst possible pain

I have committed that crime which no one can forgive

At last, Volterra, I have arrived

I will ask Aro to kill me

Tell him that you had died

27

He will agree after hearing my story

Ah! What was I expecting?

And what Aro planned

He was all the time imagining

Me joining his hideous clan

But no one can stop me from dying

I will force them to kill me

A backup plan I had been planning

If they refused to kill me

The Volturi are very protective of their city

And this will be my target

Marcus day was to be celebrated

My wish will surely be granted

When I will step out shirtless

Gleaming brightly into the sunlight

They will kill me, I was doubtless

Because the chances were very bright

The thought of you lying pale, cold

You innocent smile, your warm flushing cheeks all gone

An honest simple girl killed by a hundred year old

A century ago, I should have been gone

Your eyes will not shine anymore

Your heart been stopped forever

28

I won't hear your honey voice anymore

I snatched your soul from you forever

On my chest, your head will no more rest

I can no more run my fingers through your delicate hair

Now I can never hold you close to my chest

To you, my love, I can no more come near

I lost my love

A dad his child

Friends their pal

Could something be anymore wild?

Just wait till 12, Bella

I am going to hell

I will ask for the most severe punishment, Bella

Which will be certainly given I can tell

Even if it wasn't my guilt

To the Volturi I still would have gone

Because I can't live in a world where you don't exist

I can't exist; I can't live, when you are gone

I took off my white shirt

Standing bare chest at the edge of alley

Waiting for the clock to strike twelve

When the sun will be at its peak

29

My arms were hanging at my sides

I was relaxed, "It will be all over"

Eyes closed, I could hear the festival's noise

Ah! 12 the clock has stroked, "All is now over".

I stepped out into the sun

Feeling the warmth of its rays

Something else was also there

Someone trying to break my daze

Very slightly, I smiled

Opening slowly, my eyes

There she was beautiful and fragile

"Amazing! So Carlisle was right"

"I can't believe how quick it was

I didn't feel a thing, not even slightly

They suck the honey out of your breath

But cannot affect your beauty"

I brushed my hand against her cheek

So I was after all in hell

You, they will make me forever see

Make me inhale your smell

So that my biggest crime

In the form of your fragile figure

Will always remain in front of my eyes

Inducing me the worst torture

30

In hell I will forever see

My love whom I had killed

Standing right in front of me

I will repent, burn in guilt

"But why are you struggling, Bella?

What is it?

What? You are alive, Bella!

I can't believe it"

Yeah, she was alive

Breathing frantically, drenched in sweat

Her beauty always made me sigh

Neither she nor I was dead

.

.

.

.

"I just can't believe it

When all hopes were gone

When darkness had drowned me into its pit

There, my love, you like an angel dawned

I am so sorry

Because I hurt you

It just didn't work, honey

Even if I had lied to save you

31

But how could you believe me

After all the 1000 times I told you I loved you

How could you let one word break your faith in me?

When, in fact I could not even exist without needing you?

I have always loved you

I will always love you

I was thinking only of you

Every second I was away from you

I will prove that I love you"

I leaned in to kiss her

But she pleaded me not to

Why? What was with her?

"Is it because I am too late?

Because I have hurt you too much?

Have you moved on like I meant?

That would only be quite fair

So please don't try to spare my feelings

Just tell me whether or not you can still love me

After all that I did to you, after all those cruel things

Can you still accept me? Can you still love me?"

"Yes, of course," she replied

"The way I feel about you will never change

32

And in these words there is not a shred of lie"

That is all I needed to hear her say

"I will never let you go

For even a second, out of my sight

I will never ever leave you alone

I will hold you closely every night

My love, forget all your pains

I will heal all your wounds

Now only happiness you will gain

Inside me only love for you will be found

Now there will be no more worries in our lives

I will make everything alright

Let's begin a fresh chapter in our lives

Which is with love and hope all bright

I will never be able to forgive

The hideous crime I committed

But such pure love I will give

That all your pains will be eliminated

I promise to love you forever

Reaccept me, Isabella Swan

I will hurt you never ever

Marry me, Isabella Marie Swan"

33

WHO IS THE ONE

FOR HER?

Jacob, may be you are better for her

Than me, you also very much love her

Although, of course, not nearly as much as me

But enough, I think to keep her happy

You won't have to change her

You don't crave to kill her

I honestly want to keep Bella human

For this, you are better than me for her

Too precious, too pure; her soul is

There is only one way to preserve it

That I stay away from her

As I am too dangerous for her

You don't every second

Badly lust for her blood

You won't kill her, she is safe with you

She won't lose her soul with you

You don't have to control the desire to kill her every moment

You don't have the fear to lose control with her any moment

Thus, her life is not at risk every second, with you

Her life is secure as long as she stays with you

34

Moreover you are strong, though not as much as me

You are a shape shifter; still you can fight with those like me

So you can support and secure her both emotionally and physically

But I don't know why in doing this my heart isn't at peace

What if your love isn't enough to keep her happy?

What if she forever solely craves my company?

What if she doesn't love you, not even a bit?

What if every shred of her heart beats just for me?

Will she ever be able to leave me?

With you will she ever be able to live?

Even if you don't have to change her

What is the guarantee that you will never leave her?

Even if she can live with you being still human

What is the guarantee she won't kill herself for me?

Because I have felt how her heart beats for me

In her eyes I have seen infinite love for me

Even if you don't lust for her blood

But you are still a shape shifter; not completely human

You can't always control your anger

What if it proves a danger for her?

May be you won't kill her deliberately

But you can take her life by your control losing

What if when Sam and others are not with you

35

You won't be able to protect her alone?

So may be this is not to be decided by you or me

The decision making should be in her power completely

Because she has every right to spend her life

With the person she can't live without; the one she desires

And I promise that I won't leave her again

Until and unless she herself orders me to go away

So if you want a competition, I will give you one

A strong one; let's see who wins, let's see for her who is the one.

36

BELLA'S CALL:

"COME BACK TO ME"

"You don't belong in my world, Bella

I don't want you to come with me

It will be as if I had never existed, Bella

You won't do anything reckless, promise me"

"No, this isn't real, this can't be

I am breaking, Edward, don't say this

Please, don't snatch my life from me

My heart is too weak to endure this"

I wanted to say all this to him

But ended up promising what he had asked

That I won't be reckless even without him

But was this possible? From me my heart asked

He gave me his last kiss

His lips cold on my forehead

This was my last moment of bliss

He left like wind, it was my life's end

The tree's leaves rustled due to his quick passage

Love, life, meaning, all he took away with him

My limbs went numb, bones felt weak as if old with age

I could not lose him, I had to find him

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

37

The forest was silent around me

He left no signs behind him

Even then, nothing can stop me

"Edward! Edward!" I began to call him

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

My eyes were burning

My breathing was frantic

My body was shaking

What just happened, I couldn't believe it

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me!"

I kept searching the forest for him

Evening fell, it was new moon

I couldn't believe that I had forever lost him

I fell on the forest floor, drenching in rain, amidst gloom

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I remember the first day I saw you

I had never seen such other worldly beauty

I was dazed, mystified by you

But you behaved so bad with me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

The first day you talked to me

Your voice was honey, your eyes gold

Your charisma had imprisoned me

And I remained such even as our relationship grew old

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

38

I had never ever imagined

That in this little town of Forks

A vampire so beautiful will love me

Someone so perfect can love me, it always seemed odd

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I used to drown in those gold eyes of you

I used to get dazed inhaling fragrance of you

I just loved and loved and loved you

I can never imagine a life without you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I miss you every moment, Edward

How I used to wake up to see

And what bliss it used to give me, Edward

You waiting with your Volvo for me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Driving me to school

Taking classes together

Why did this end so soon?

Why couldn't it last forever?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Gym without you used to be hell

Sitting in cafeteria, you eating nothing

We used to have so many stories to tell

With you days didn't seem to end, time didn't feel escaping

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

39

I loved your beautiful meadow, Edward

But still it wasn't as beautiful as you

When sun's rays made your skin gleam like diamond

Angels seemed nothing to me when compared to you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

We used to be there for hours

Lost deeply in each other

Just loving each other all in all

You were the most beautiful thing I had seen ever

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Lying silent we talked through our eyes

Your amazing fragrance made my mouth water

A stupid lamb had fallen in love with a majestic lion

Even after knowing that he was the most dangerous predator

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Your perfect voice, your too perfect face

Your cool breath, your sharp features

The way you walked with striking grace

You were the world's most perfect creature

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You used to carry me on your back

And run faster than the wind through the forest

The wind watering my eyes, my hair flowing back

Still I felt completely safe as my arms were holding your chest

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

40

The way you had, that day, lifted the van

To save me, you had risked there your everything

Your courage, your bravery, your strength

Your love, just you, only you are my everything

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Your beauty always mesmerized me

Your perfect body, your angelic face

Carved in some unknown stone; life for me

Your bronze hair I had always loved to gaze

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You looked like a male super model

Your color shifting eyes made me sigh

With you, all my worries were forgotten

How you used to read my face and tell everything right

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I was completely dazzled by you

Your mind reading talent was so unique

But my mind couldn't be read by you

Was there something wrong with me?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Your crooked smile had always taken away my breath

Lost in your eyes, I would completely forget to breathe

Your lovely sweet voice I kept recalling in my head

One can never thank enough for such complete bliss

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

41

The hours when you used to be away hunting

Seemed so hard to pass, long like eternity

And what will I do now? I am thinking

There is no way I can survive this, honestly

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

When during classes how we used to be talking

And when the teacher used to come and ask

You would tell each and every word correctly

What incredible intelligence and memory you had got

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

My writing looked like an ugly scrawl

In comparison to your fast, elegant calligraphy

How perfect was each tiny detail, just all

And you wanted only me? It seemed such an impossibility

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

My bedroom always blossomed with your scent

Your, staying over each night, watching me sleep

The kisses you gave, with me every moment you spent

My heart started racing every time you touched me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

How I had always used to hate rain

But now strangely I had started to like it

Because not seeing you at school was a pain

The clouds, the darkness, everything with you seemed brightly lit

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

42

Your most beautiful gift to me was your kissing

Whenever your cool firm lips crushed mine

My heart went racing, I felt dizzy

I couldn't believe that someone like you was mine

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

When our lips parted in between

I used to inhale deeply your scent

I always wanted you to keep kissing me

But you felt yourself dangerous for me, so a distance you always kept

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

When your skin touched mine

Currents began to flow through me

You were most precious, utterly divine

I loved the way you looked at me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You gave me such pure, selfless love

I didn't believe such love existed before I met you

There were no boundaries, no limits of your love

How crazy it felt when you said I was the life of you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You were perfect in other things too

What a taste in music you had

When you used to play for me your piano

Colors and beautiful emotions in my heart played

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

43

Without sleeping you had spent 90 years of your life

Hundreds of books you read, inspirational music you collected

You were the most charming, complete, genius man I had ever met in my life

The fastest Cullen, most gorgeous of all, only in you my ideal I founded

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You had lived more than 100 years, you were immortal

Still I was the only one to touch your heart

How sincere and caring you were, extremely loyal

Over protective, extra careful, my lively and bright sweetheart

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Your family was so nice and caring

How you dearly loved them all

I also considered it my family

"My other family", I used to call

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

When I look back at my life before you

I wonder whether I was living at all?

Those 16 years were a waste without you

A dull, colorless life it was, all in all

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

44

I had never felt myself special before you

I didn't believe in completely pure and selfless love

I had never dated or loved anyone before you

Because only you could give me an otherworldly love

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I had never imagined that

Such beauty, honesty and purity existed

When you came you proved to me that

There was so much more to life that I was thinking

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You had everything a girl could possibly dream

Beauty, love, sincerity, strength, devotion and loyalty

Were all concentrated in you to their highest degree

And you completely gave it all to me, your life you called me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I had never ever dreamt

That someone will give me so much love

That someone so beautiful, so pure existed

I just can't describe it in words

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

My life was brightened by you

You became my total universe

I could dream and think only of you

I didn't believe that someone like you I could deserve

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

45

In your love I had forgotten

My friends, my relatives, my earlier family

In you my entire world I had gotten

With you at my side I cared about nothing

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

But there was still restlessness

In my heart that I would lose you

Because I don't deserve you, my ordinariness

My being average in everything would be the cause of losing you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

In my heart I thought

That I am no match for you

I deserved you completely not

I wasn't good enough for you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

On the other hand you always thought

Yourself to be bad, dangerous for me

That you too deserved me completely not

I can't imagine why, but this you had always told me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Both of our thinking were wrong

We were both made for each other

But sometimes, some things can't go on

Like me and you living together forever

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

46

We both were lost in each other

But see what fate did to us

Your thinking that you were a mere danger

Forever parted us, forever doomed us

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

What happened with Jasper was nothing, Edward

Because you were always there to protect me

You had saved me from both James and Jasper

How could you possibly be a danger for me?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I know you hated the life of a vampire

You thought that one losses his soul in this

You wanted to become a human for me at any price

But as this was impossible, you should have changed me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

And this you never accepted

You could never imagine my heart stop

You could never imagine my soul wasted

You could never imagine my warmth gone

"Come back to me, Edward come back to me"

Why? Edward, why? I need nothing of this

I only want to spend with you eternity

I loathe my being human because we were separated by this

I just want you; you were my life, my breathing

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

47

The nature was against our love

But we could change it forever

If you could ever change me, my love

We would have been together forever

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I had seen intense love for me in your eyes

I just can't believe that you didn't want me

I have always seen love, my want in your eyes

And I know that a lie was nothing of this

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I know all those promises weren't a lie

I know you had always been honest and truthful to me

Its impossible that your eyes could have lied

Only once you lied, in that forest, because no expression in your eyes I could see

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

At that time I was so shocked

My mind had stopped working

Not knowing, I let you go, not fought

That was the biggest mistake of me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

You are a good liar, Edward

I had almost believed you

But when I thought afterward

I knew I could only be loved by you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

48

The only lie you had ever told was this

That you didn't want me, that you didn't love me

There are only two things possible, either this

Or that ever since I had come to Forks, I had been dreaming

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Yeah, it could all have been a dream

I had always been doubtful

That someone like you could be existing

Just for me, just to love me, how impossible

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

If you were a dream then unfortunately

I was forbidden to remember you

But I was terrified of forgetting

It was very difficult to live up to

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Or may be I am just going crazy

May be there is something wrong with me

Someone like you, on my own, I can't possibly imagine

I had felt your pure love and my feelings don't deceive me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Someone so perfect and beautiful

My imagination just can't create

You existed, yeah, but still I am doubtful

It was something beyond our power which made us separate

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

49

In my dreams, my nightmares, too

I am miserably looking everywhere for you

But still can't see you, can't reach you

Due to my horrible screams, Charlie can't sleep, too

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I am losing my confidence in myself

I am falling into pieces

Breaking, shattering, I am losing myself

I am still confused that you existed

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I needed proofs so I went to find them

First, I liked living in Forks which is dark and rainy

Why? Because in sunlight I won't be able to see you out there

Yeah, you existed, you were here with me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Second, the seat beside me in class

Is always empty, no one sits in there

Because it's only you I can see in it at all

Yeah you existed, with me you were there

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Third, my friends weren't being friendly with me

Because it had been such a long time

Since I last sat with them; with me

You used to sit at a separate table since long time

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

50

That table is now empty

No one sits there

One of its occupants is too weak

To be all alone there

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

The sure proof I got

When I went to your meadow

It was not that beautiful without you, though not changed a lot

All the place I recognized, a blessing upon me you had endowed

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I recognized where we most often used to lay down

Lost in each other, lost in our perfect love

I felt nauseated, pain of losing you was breaking me down

My memories were haunting me, how I had lost you, my love

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

All the flowers were there, lively, dancing, the meadow was so brightly lit

Unaware that its occupant, its most beautiful part was gone

It felt incomplete, it felt hollow, my soul was from pain trembling

And there I saw someone, your proof standing there all alone

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

51

It was Laurent, a still figure

Shining like a diamond, staring at me

At his sight, ran down through me a shiver

He was gracefully progressing towards me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

He told me that he had been sent by Victoria

And he felt me extremely mouth watering

Although he had initially been there to asses the area

But now he was unable to resist killing me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

So you were really there all that time

I had not simply imagined you

Someone like you was right in front of my eyes

Now I was no more confused about you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

"How much could you mean to him?

He left you here unprotected, all alone

Surely you are not that important to him

May be you were before, but now not anymore"

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Each of his words with all its hurt

Went like a sword through my chest

Piercing my lungs, devastating my heart

Taking away my little feeble remaining rest

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

52

But of all the world I was sure of this one thing

That I loved you completely, thoroughly, infinitely

Doesn't matter whether or not you anymore wanted me

Just you were my whole life, my only life for eternity

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I closed my eyes, inhaling Laurent's scent

He was now so close, my life was about to end

"I love you, Edward, I love you", in my heart I said

Having picture of you in my mind I braced myself for death

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Suddenly, there was a whooshing noise

Laurent stepped back, his eyes wide

Six huge wolves were there, each unusually oversized

A russet brown wolf eyed me with some strange expression in his eyes

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I couldn't understand what it was trying to say

But I knew that it was the only chance for me

To save my life; from death I could only now run away

I broke into a run without a single glance behind me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Although the experience in the meadow was terrifying

But it had its own benefit, I had finally learned that

You weren't merely an imagination, you were existing

Somewhere I couldn't reach, nor I could try to find that

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me''

53

You were a vampire, Edward

I could look for you nowhere

For my safety you had left and your moving backward

Was impossible, your decision couldn't be changed ever

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I didn't give much thought on Laurent's words

That you didn't want me, didn't love me

He knew very little about our love and his few words

Couldn't break my trust in you, couldn't break me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

It is quite a relief to be finally unconfused

At least I am breathing in the same air as you

But it is so painful to breathe without you

It is utterly impossible to live without you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Time used to pass so pleasantly with you

Now each second passes like a pulse hammering behind a bruise

There were no worries, no sadness with you

Now there are just horrible screams and only tears from my eyes ooze

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I can't live without drowning in those gold eyes of you

I can't live without inhaling the sweet fragrance of you

It is just impossible for my heart to beat without you

How can I live without you when there is no life without you?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

54

I hardly sleep at all, surrounded by nightmares

The feeling of losing you has bored a hole through my chest

And when I wake up in the morning, my room without you looks bare

You are no more there with your arms open for me, how can I rest?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Your fragrance doesn't prevail in my room anymore

Your Volvo doesn't wait for me outside my home

Your love isn't there to comfort and brighten me at school

There is no one to lay there with me in your meadow

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

The lion is gone and the lamb is lost, devastated

No one carries me on his back and run through the forest

No one is there to shine like a diamond when sun lit

I no more rest against your heart which belonged to me in your chest

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

No one stays over every night and watches me sleep

No one is there to give me the kiss so pure with love

The pieces of my shattered soul, together I can no more keep

I can't breathe, I can't live without you, my love

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

55

I miss your crooked smiles, your honey sweet voice

Your mind reading, your color shifting eyes

Your humming me your lullaby to sleep, so angelic, so nice

Your playing piano, your vast knowledge, everything makes me sigh

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Besides the pain of losing you there is another worry

I think your memories are fading, I may forget you

You took away all your pictures, your gifts, your things

This only gave me pain and I know to you too

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I never could get used to your perfection

And when there is a fear of forgetting it

I have become completely numb, completely restless

I will have to work out some way to remember it

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

On my way back with Jessica, that other day

I saw some people which I thought I knew

They seemed dangerous, still I couldn't stay away

It will make me remember you! That I never knew

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

When I progressed towards them I heard you

So clearly as if you were right there beside me

I know you would have stopped me, if you had been really there

56

Like the voice of you in my head which had then warned me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Thus I worked out my way of remembering you

Whenever I approached danger I would hear you

Your sweet voice melted in my ears, reminding me of you

With me your presence I felt, as if it were really you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

There was only one reason I could think of hearing your voice

Because you loved me, you wanted to keep me safe always

But it affected me otherwise, I now wanted dangers to rise

So that I will be able to hear you, forever, always

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I now made a plan with Jake

I learned to ride motorbikes

He didn't know my original plan

I was just looking for danger to hear your voice

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

During my this planning

Jake was trying to come near me

He had started to like me

But of course, I couldn't love him

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

57

Nor could I get away from him

I absolutely needed him

This made me feel so guilty

For myself, I was just using him

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

Hearing your smooth velvet voice, feeling the perfection of it

Smoothened the sharp edges of the burning hole in my chest

I could do absolutely anything, go to infinite limits to hear it

Because only it gave me happiness, it was my only cause of rest

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I feared the idea that I would slowly lose it

So I had to find a danger more exciting than bikes

And there it was; the angry waves, the tall cliffs

A soothing sensation crept into me; I was about to hear your voice

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I had imagined this long freefall

The feeling of utter freedom

It was simply inviting, all in all

The end was coming near and near

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

58

I took a step towards cliffs' edge

Staring into the thundering waves down there

"Bella", "Yes?" "Don't do this"

Your pleading honey voice said in my ear

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

"You wanted me to be human, well, watch me"

"Please, for me, please", you begged

"But in any other way you won't stay with me"

"Stop! Bella!" You were now angry, you had growled

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I knew that Edward, you loved me

I knew that you would do anything to keep me safe

I shouldn't have done this but your voice with so much clarity

I wanted to hear so much that I couldn't stop in any way

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I didn't know what suffering it will bring on you

I was just dying to be that close to you

Your voice in my subconscious before me, revived you

Whenever I went against my promise to you

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I dived into the water, falling freely

You were shouting in my ear, happiness spread through me

The water was ice cold just like your touch on me

The waves were tossing me in every direction, knocking the air out of me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

59

"Bella! Keep fighting! Keep swimming!" you ordered

But I didn't want to; I was feeling finally happy

Death was better to live without you but I wondered

Whether it was right? Wasn't I doing wrong to you; deceiving?

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I tried to swim towards the surface

But everything was black around me

I didn't know where to swim; water waves

Were beating, playing with me

"Come back to me, Edward, come back to me"

I was drowning, going deeper and deeper

Something hard struck me and pulled me down with it

"Goodbye, I love you, Edward" I had never imagined the end so near

"I am sorry, Edward; I broke my promise, try to forgive me"

.

.

.

.

In the plane I was the most miserable person

Tears won't stop, my whole life flashing before my eyes

How Jacob had saved me from drowning, and a person

Had come to visit me; Alice, she had given me a huge surprise

60

I didn't know what to do, what to say

All my wounds, memories became fresh

Her gold eyes, her scent, her angelic face

I saw you in her; I missed you afresh

Everything was going well, that time was so precious with Alice

She was just like my sister, I so much loved her

She had been there to check on me, she had said

She had seen me jumping off the cliff in a vision of her

Her vision had went blank after seeing this

And she had thought that I had killed myself; suicided

But now she knew that I was alive, fine; a bliss

For her it was and she was now relaxed, comforted

Her vision had disappeared

Because Jacob had saved me

And she couldn't see werewolves

In her vision, she told me

Then a phone call came

Which Jacob attended

"He is away at the funeral," he said

It was Carlisle he had told me

A minute later, Alice came, her perfect features moulded into worry

What had happened when I had asked her the worst

61

words she told me

It wasn't Carlisle on phone it was you Edward; Jacob had lied to me

You thought that I was dead and you were going to Italy to Volturi

Those words were the most painful words I had ever heard in my life

The idea of you going to get yourself killed because I had died

Almost killed me, sucked the life out of me, I had went wild

I had to save you somehow, it was all my mistake; all mine

When James had attacked me

Edward you had told me about your plan

To go to the Volturi and ask them to kill

I couldn't imagine the idea and now also I can't

I had forbade you to do such a thing then

Then why did you still have to go?

My this blunder could never ever be forgiven

My supposed death had made you go

Alice told me that the Volturi had rejected to kill you

A wave of relief passed through me

But Alice still looked worried, was something still wrong with you?

You had not stopped; you still wanted to be killed

62

Alice told me your whole plan, she was blank, expressionless

At 12 noon, near clock tower, you will come

And you will expose them all; you will be shirtless

And your skin will glitter like diamond from rays of sun

Volturi were very protective of their city

Any risk of exposure they couldn't tolerate

Thus you will get your wish granted; you will be killed

An idea which I could never ever tolerate

I just couldn't imagine this in my mind

That something like this can occur, can happen

You not existing? How impossible! You were my entire life

I had to stop this, "I will save you, this won't happen!"

Now I know why you were doing this

Because if something happens to you

Which is impossible for me to think

I will certainly kill myself for you too

But you also love me to this degree?

I never knew, I could never believe

"But my love, I am coming, Alice, hurry!

Drive the car as fast as you can, hurry!"

Each passing second felt like hell to me

I was just about to lose my everything

"Edward! You are far more precious than me,

Please, stop! Please, wait for me"

63

My eyes with tears were flooding

My heartbeat rapidly racing

The idea of you not existing

Was driving me completely crazy

This time was more important than eternity

"I will save you, I will," I promised

And there at clock tower we had reached

Clock was about to strike 12, I had to hurry

Though my whole body was numb, there was no feeling

I ran with all the strength a feeble human could have possibly

There you were; shirtless, perfect, angelic, beautiful, gleaming

It was really you, it wasn't a dream, I just couldn't believe

I had never seen anything more beautiful

All the past seven months now meant nothing to me

Only with your love my soul, my heart was full

Nothing at all anymore mattered to me

"No! Edward, don't!" I shouted with all my might

You weren't listening although I was madly screaming

You were taking a step towards direct sunlight

And my worst nightmare in front of my eyes was developing

64

I slammed with all my force into you

You didn't move even an inch

With all my might I pushed you

But still I couldn't move you in

I was inhaling your most beautiful scent

In your lovely velvet voice you said

"Carlisle was right. I am impressed

They so quickly did it; nothing I felt"

"They just steal your sweet scent

But have no power on your beauty"

You held me tight, "Bella", you said

Hearing my name in your voice made me dizzy

I was still struggling to push you back

"What is it?" You slowly opened your eyes

"Edward! You are not dead, step back

And neither am I, step back before they arrive!"

Comprehension dawned on your face

You moved me towards the wall

Now you were safe, my life was safe

Only now I could breathe at all

.

.

.

.

65

"Why did you believe me so quickly, Bella?"

"I was shocked, I couldn't think"

"You don't know how it tortured me, Bella

The expression on your face always haunted me"

"Don't worry, Edward, afterwards I had realized

That you had lied to me there

I had always seen the intense love for me in your eyes

I know that you were also broken there"

"I just did it to protect you, Bella

I felt the thought of parting torturing me, killing me

But I could never imagine that Victoria.....

I don't know how to say it, will you ever forgive me?"

Will you forgive me? Can you reaccept me?

After all that I did to you can you still love me?

After all the pain that I gave you, can you still want me?"

Edward was asking questions with such doubtless answers from me

"The way I feel about you will never change, not even a bit

Can you forgive me for being so utterly reckless?

Can you forgive me for breaking my promise; for deceiving?"

I was so broken inside, I felt completely breathless

66

"You were just being human, Bella

You need not to say sorry

I will never ever leave you, Bella

You will never get another pain from me"

You kissed me and I wasn't dreaming

You were so close; my life was back

After believing that lost was my everything

Edward, you were back, what a bliss! You were back!

My most precious gift of life was back

Your kissing again made me light headed

Breathless, utterly happy that my life was back

I kissed you back and kissed and kissed

Another forever had started

We both now knew what

Had been the mistakes we committed

Which had caused us to part

With a promise to never make such mistakes again

We both declared our love, Edward proposed me

It stopped my heart, again I forgot to breathe

Of course "yes" I said, no one in the world could be happier than me

As long as we are together

No pain, no sadness can touch us

We are life of each other

No power can ever separate us

67

With these promises we both forgot all our pains

Forks was again beautiful, I was again alive

Of course now there will be no losses, only gains

As long as I am with my destiny, my true life

68

JACOB BLACK'S

STORY

I was so excited

Forks was about to be visited

By my childhood friend Bella

I was so eager to meet my Bella

There we met on a beach where I lived

Like an angel she looked, my dream girl

She had now come to stay over for a long while

We spent together that day a long time

The way she looked at me

I felt she liked me

She was talking so intimately with me

Then about the Cullens she asked me

We went to sit on a broken tree

Lying on the shore of the beach

Some old legends I told her

She seemed very interested by the look of her

69

She promised to spend time with me again

With her school friends she had to go back

That little meeting I knew never

Will be the most important for me ever

She had left such a mark on my heart

That love was blooming, she was now the occupant of my heart

The next time I saw her she was with Edward Cullen

I didn't give it much thought because the Cullens befriended none

But I didn't know that when my love was beginning

To bloom, it will as soon be sent towards its ending

The girl of whom I was so sure that she liked me

Was now with another guy, she no more wanted me

She was from the start interested in the Cullens

Therefore, she had asked me those legends

I never believed those legends to be right

They told that the Cullens were vampires

I seldom met Bella now

But still I loved her even now

70

I decided that I will be the best friend of hers

Whenever she will need me I will be there for her

I will take away all her fears

I will wipe away all her tears

But a question I always asked from me

Why did she prefer Edward on me?

Was it because he was far more beautiful than me?

Or was it because he was far more richer than me?

Bella didn't seem to be such a girl

But the reality was she was now his girl

Then as the next year started

A little present on her birthday I gifted

She didn't like the idea of gifts

But surely a present I had to give

She loved it and promised to keep it safe

It was a charm supposed to keep her safe

I hugged her tightly sighing

When I saw Edward staring

Hatred whipped through me

Anger lashed through me

71

Still I let her go to him

She had immense love in her eyes for him

The love in her eyes was very strong

I realized that him; she couldn't live without

I was content that she was so happy with him

He also loved her equally I expected from him

But a little time later Charlie called

Bella was nowhere to be found

Another news was also spreading

That the Cullens had left silently

So he had left her all alone

She was missing because he had gone

At night Sam found Bella in the woods

It still haunts Sam how she had looked

Edward had broken her

He had completely shattered her

He was the most cruel monster

He never ever deserved her

Bella was completely destroyed

She was infinitely devastated

72

She no more smiled

She always looked so wild

Her eyes were always red from crying

She never smiled, was always sighing

She now spent her time all alone

Lost in thoughts of him who was gone

Whenever something made her remember him

She would wrap her arms around her chest tightly

As if the memory would tear her apart

As if it would burst her heart

Charlie had told me how she always screamed

Horribly at nights from nightmares in her sleep

She was so sensitive, so fragile

This horrible situation; how could she survive?

She had lost her enthusiasm, her spirit was lost

All the excitement, happiness and peace of her was gone

He had played with her innocence

How badly he returned her love and devotion

If I was asked to kill one person in the whole world

I was sure; completely doubtless that it would be Edward Cullen

73

Then she started to spend a little time with me

Of course, she could always come back to me

I would give her such love that she would forget

That monster completely who had so cruelly left

She helped me to get parts for the Rabbit

And in favor asked me bike mending

We together in my garage mended some bikes

Which I gleefully taught her to ride

As this was a little risky

So we hadn't told Charlie and Billy about this

She would now spend the whole day with me

All the time doing adventurous things

Her condition slowly started to become better

Now she smiled and regained her enthusiasm

This is what I aimed at

To get her enchanting smile back

I would be her best friend

And at the right time express my love

When she would have completely forgotten him

When she would have moved over him

74

We used to spend so much time together

We were becoming nearer and closer

"Bella, I know what he did to you

And I would never ever do that to you"

I promised her this

But may be it wasn't long lived

I felt all hot, Sam and his friends always stared at me.

Something strange was going on with me

Something had first happened to Paul, Quil and Embry

And they had all then joined him

They all looked hopefully towards me

As if expecting something from me

I was terrified beyond my wits

I didn't want something bad to happen to me

Something that would make me join Sam

I never wanted to be his pal

Days passed and changes grew through me

Damn it! What was happening to me?

Each and every day I was growing

Becoming bulkier and taller

75

The growth spurt was so quick

That Bella also noticed it

I always had fever now

I always felt irritated, down

One day the fever grew more intense

Bella and I were both so tense

Billy asked me to stay at home and get some rest

During this all of a sudden the "thing" happened

Ah! What a fate! What a world!

All those legends in reality were!

I had transformed into a wolf

I had become a werewolf

This is what they were expecting from me

This is what they were looking for inside me

So the Cullens were really vampires

And a nauseatic feeling through me rised

Bella loved a blood sucker, a leech

And she never bothered to tell me!

What was she thinking?

Did she want to be killed?

76

So dangerous he was for her

From him I had to save her

He wasn't human at all

What was he doing with Bella!

Now I understand why he looked at Bella as if she was something to eat

Because the reality was this that for him she WAS something to eat

And Bella was with him

Just because he was so beautiful and rich

Didn't she ever worry about her life?

How in his presence could she thrive?

He was the predator and she was the prey

How in his company she could stay?

What were they both thinking?

Why everything was she risking?

Didn't she realize that he would one day end her life?

For God's sake, was she out of her bloody mind?

Just thinking of their relationship gives me chills

It makes me sick, it makes me ill

77

It was thoroughly sadomasochism

It was something entirely forbidden

May be Edward liked to play with the prey first

Then afterwards dramatically satiated his thirst

Thanks God his bloody family left

I will never ever let him near her again

Bella, its my promise to you

I will forever protect you

"But how Jacob? How?

To tell her anything you are not allowed"

There was actually a treaty between the Cullens

And our ancestors, our old ones

Cullens had said that different they had stayed

In place of humans, on animals they preyed

On the condition that they keep true to these words

We wouldn't enter their territory and harm no one

Nor we will expose them to the world

They will be normal humans for others

Besides their identity we also could not

Expose our identity to the human lot

78

As it would also expose the Cullens

And the treaty would be broken

So I was also forbidden to tell

About my werewolf self

In addition I was also dangerous to her

So I was forced to stay away from her

I started rejecting her calls

I didn't talk to her at all

As this would break my control

I should better be left alone

Thus I had broken my promise

To never ever do what the leech did

But I also had left her

When I was most needed by her

This situation burned me from inside

Although I looked tough on the outside

Anxiously I would circle around her home

At nights, so nothing harms her, this way she wouldn't be alone

I was also anxious to stay there

Because someone evil was back here

79

Victoria was looking forward to kill Bella

As Edward had murdered James for Bella

United our whole werewolf team

So that, Bella safe we keep

On one such day when we were out in the forest

We got the burning stench of one of the vamps

We all gathered to attack together

It was Laurent, near Bella; about to kill her

But he didn't expect us

He backed away on seeing us

We outnumbered him hugely

So we had killed him easily

Before attacking I had went near Bella

With my eyes I was trying to tell Bella

That it was me; I was a werewolf

But she didn't understand what she was being told

Laurent was sent there by Victoria

To search for Cullens the area

So that if Bella is alone, unprotected

She get her revenge from Edward by killing

80

His love; as he pretended that Bella

Was to him; that he dearly loved Bella

And see what was the cruel reality

He had left her completely unprotected

It didn't matter to him if she died or lived

She was nothing, absolutely nothing for him

She was in mortal danger

I had to protect her

She was burdened by so many things

Flight of Edward, fear of being killed

And her best friend didn't even talk to her

Oh God! I had been so much upsetting her

I was helpless

Utterly restless

But how could I tell her? What could I do?

When telling anything I was forbidden to

It was too risky, too dangerous to break the treaty

Because it would start a fight between us and the vampires surely

But when she came to my home, broken, beaten

Drenched in rain, completely sadness laden

81

Reminding me about my promise

She asked me why I was doing this

I asked her to leave me alone

But in fact, I could take this no more

I had to do something

I couldn't see her like this

I loved her so much

From me she deserved this much

That I go tell her everything

But it will then break the treaty

I was confused, I was irritated

I was broken, I couldn't endure this

I was going to end this all

I had made my plan and all

On that first day, on that beach

I had in a sense told her everything

I didn't know that those legends were true then

Therefore, the treaty was still unbroken, intact

And if I try to remind her the stories

She will definitely be able to work out my secret

82

So one night, I climbed into her room

Through her window, I was confident that soon

I will befriend her again and she

Will workout all the points of the story

I told her the situation

That if she thinks with concentration

She will work out why I wasn't talking to her

She didn't respond, I had probably confused her

But I emphasized on that beach day with her

And yes, my efforts were fruitful; it was worked out by her

"So you are a werewolf, Jacob Black?"

In a strange way she asked me that

"What is so strange?" I asked her

She said that it had surprised her

That her best friend was also not human

She was living in what kind of world?

Was anything merely a myth anymore?

How many secrets were there to be exposed?

But I had much more pressing questions on my mind

And I will ask her all no matter if it takes a long time

83

"Did you know that Edward is a vampire?"

"Yeah, I had worked out that secret in too little a time"

"What were you possibly thinking?"

Why your life you were risking?"

"I wasn't risking my life at all

In fact, he was my life all in all

I wasn't risking anything at all

He was never a danger at all"

"So you didn't realize that he was going to end your life?"

"For God's sake Jake! He loved me, we were each others life

How can he possibly end his own life?

In fact, he was always over protective, all the time"

"Bella, were you out of your bloody mind?

What were you thinking! He was a VAMPIRE!"

"He lives on animal blood, Jacob

Although, he craves for human blood

But he disgusts such an act

On his principles he always acts

Which are never to hurt a human

To feed only on the animals

84

Even if my blood most lusts him

I was in no danger from him"

"What are you saying? Were you different for him?

More delicious to him, more wanted, more thirsted by him?"

"Yeah Jake, its true but he completely loved me

More than anyone has ever loved anybody

His love was the strongest love in the world

He had amazing control. He had crossed all limits of love"

"Then why did he left you here?"

"Because, of the danger he wasn't aware"

He didn't know that Victoria could do such a thing

He considered himself merely a danger to me

He thought that as long as I was with him

Vampires will keep coming across me

They could hurt me, they could kill me

Just like James and Jasper had attacked me

Therefore, he left; just to protect me,

Just to keep me alive, from dangers save me

But how can I possibly live without him?

He was the entire life of me!

85

Love, life, meaning were all over

On the day he left Forks forever"

"But why, Bella, why?

Why do you prefer him on me, why?

Is it because he was so beautiful, had good looks?

Does a fish fall in love with an eagle just because of its good looks?

For God's sake Bella! You are going against nature

At least look into your own species, don't defy your nature"

"I didn't love him just because he looked good, Jacob

But because he was the most caring, loving, generous

Kind, loyal, truthful person I have ever seen

He is the most perfect person ever been

Living or lived since the world started

Since the first bud into flower had blossomed

He was the best possible reason to live

Someone to whom all your love you could give

He was like the most beautiful dream

Any human can ever have, can ever see

He changed my entire life

Opened an entirely new dimension of life

86

For me he was my window to happiness

Anyone would love him, I am doubtless"

"Ha! At least I am not one of those who like him

No one deserves any more hatred from all than him

There is no need to lie; is it the money then?"

"Jacob Black! You are utterly impossible

None of the words I said is a lie

I swear this to you on my life"

She was utterly angry with me

She left angrily, ran away from me

I didn't believe any of her words

If he loved her, he wouldn't have left her

All alone, unprotected, broken, dejected

Shattered, tortured, shocked, devastated

He was just a good looking monster

Who had trapped her, played with her

And hearing Bella's words about him

How she loved him, how she worshipped him

Sickened me, made me ill

More than ever I hated him

87

He had shattered my innocent Bella

She was no more that fun loving Bella

Just for his pleasure, he played with her

After he no more wanted her, he had cruelly left her

She didn't know what she had put herself in

And now even she could only think of him

I will have to wake her up

On this I would never give up

Her words had left me speechless, hopeless

She would spend all her life in sadness

She would never ever accept me

Will she ever be able to love me?

But I won't give up on her

I will at any cost win her

What caused most hatred for vampires in me

Was that they had induced an irreversible change in me

Their presence had snatched my humanity from me

Because of them a werewolf had aroused in me

Our old legends told us that these vampires

In fact, to kill these vampires, caused our arise

88

We were destined to keep people safe from them

At any cost we would fight them, kill them

The Cullen's presence, being all the time near

Had induced the changes in me, Sam and others

I could never be a complete human again

I would never be completely safe for Bella again

But I am not a coward

I will face this situation

Courageously, bravely

As it was the fate of me

But being a werewolf also had some goods besides its bads

We could hear each others thoughts, when being wolf, in our heads

No matter we were how far

No matter if we talked or not

And hatred again whipped through me

That her blood sucker, Edward, could also do this

He could read people's minds

Thus, anything about them he could find

So the legends were true, all of them

Which told that, had such powers some of them

89

He was not the only special Cullen

Something was also wrong with Alice Cullen

She could see the future

Which depended on people's decisions

May be, I hope, in future now she sees

Isabella Swan eternally happy with me

Having forever forgotten the blood sucker

The leech, the parasite, the deceiver

Life is so cruel sometimes

When everything is going fine

And the much awaited destiny lies in front of you

It rips it apart from you, it snatches it back from you

The same that day happened to me

There were two giant things for me to worry

First; Harry Clearwater had had a heart attack

Second; the evil devilish Victoria was back

Charlie and Sue were at the hospital

While Sam, me and others were looking for her

She played a very great trick then

She moved away and in the water entered

90

The vampires had an advantage there

We werewolves couldn't do much there

I became completely tense, worried

Because Bella used to spend so much time on the beach

If she swam double back there?

I had to hurry and reach there

Before she reaches I had to go

And save Bella from any danger so

I was now running on the road

Her truck wheels track I followed

Damn it! It led to the beach

To her, I had to quickly reach

Then I heard something

That made a shudder go through me

It was Bella's screaming

Was anything bad happening?

I saw her jumping down the cliffs

How dare she suddenly without telling me do this?

What was she thinking?

Does life means to her nothing?

91

I dived into the water, as quickly

As I could, she was drowning, going deeply

I caught her and out I pulled her

I pushed out of her lungs the sea water

I was desperately trying to wake her

I couldn't endure this condition of hers

Nothing bad could happen to her

As long as I was with her

She was my life

She was about to be mine

Nothing could take her away from me

Not even death could snatch her from me

I tried and tried, she spluttered out more and more water

She was breathing, she was alive; I called her

"Bella! Honey can you hear me?"

She looked like having some bizarre dream

She opened her eyes but they were unfocused

Was she hurt? Had I been too late? Had anything bad happened?

"Bella? Love! Can you hear me? Are you alright?"

"Jacob!" she said in a broken voice

92

It was a relief that she was fine

Finally, I had saved her, made her alright

It was so cold I had to take her somewhere warm

But if she is injured? "Bella, does it hurt anywhere?" I asked

"Just in my throat", so it was okay

My home was the nearest for her to stay

I set my shoulders forward

To stop the rain from pattering on her

It was so cold; a hurricane was about to strike

At particularly this time why she had to dive

May be I knew; it was due to him

He was the sole cause for this, only him

His departure was making her insane

Alone she was no more safe

I knew she had tried to commit suicide

After he left, she didn't care much about her life

I took her inside my home, placed her on the couch

And then I went into my room

To fetch some dry clothes for her

Cold and sea water had completely drenched her

93

"These may be large, but these are the best I have got"

I gave the clothes to her, I was about to go out

So that she can change but she called me back

"I am so tired, can't move, please, with me you stay"

I stayed there with her

Looking all the while at her

She looked so wrenched, completely shattered

She was remembering him, wasn't her?

After a while, at the night

I took her and the truck I drove

She seemed so lost all the way to her home

She was thinking something deep for sure

I stopped the truck at the street

She was lying so close, resting upon me

It was the best moment of my life

But it was, by something, suddenly destroyed

Cold wind had blown into the truck sharply

Carrying with it a stench so burning

I recognized it immediately

It was a vampire definitely

94

I was badly shaking

My whole body was trembling

I was afraid that I would lose control

And then would be transformed into a wolf

But for Bella it could be dangerous

So I decided to get her out of this situation

I had just turned the truck towards the street

That she started to beg to stop the truck from me

"Are you out of your mind?

You want to go back? It's a vampire!"

"Its Carlisle, I know its him, take me back"

And my everything, every effort wasted away in that instant

Dawn had shined her face suddenly

She looked simply happy

Her eyes were so eager to see the doctor

She didn't care about me, no matter

By them what had been done to her

And how honestly I had supported her

Her heart beat only for Edward

There was no place for me ever

95

Why had I been so hopeful, so happy?

When she was so selfish that she completely betrayed me

"Take yourself back

Because there I am not going back"

Inside se had broken me completely

But for her sake something else I pretended

That If a Cullen was back then it changed everything

We didn't want to be caught on their territory

She looked shocked, comprehension dawning on her

She had seen in my eyes the accusation of betrayal on her

I could take it no more

I couldn't anymore control

I jumped out of the truck running towards my home

On the way, out of anxiety, I had become a wolf

All night I kept wandering in the forest

I had no life, no hope, no happiness, no rest

Why had life brought her so close to me?

Why did the fate bring me close to my destiny?

When it was to be snatched away from me

When it was to be ripped apart from me

96

But myself for long I couldn't hold

I again headed towards Bella's home

I had made my decision

This time I will get her

I won't let her escape in anyway

I had to tell her my feelings straight away

The blood sucker was there still

It wasn't Carlisle but Alice

Her sharp stench burned my nose

Through me waves of hatred rose

But I held myself together

Bella and I looked at each other

She smiled rather in a confused way

But she looked at me in a strange way

She asked whether we were friends again

Friends? I thought , "not this friendship crap again"

I took her into the kitchen

In my arms I wrapped her

She rested her head on my chest

Her heart beat was discontinuous I felt

97

She asked whether it was possible

To be at the same time be friends with me and the Cullens

I just promised to be her friend forever

Now I was about to do what I had wanted most ever

I cupped my hand below her chin

And pulled her face up to face me

We looked sadly for a moment towards each other

Then I took her face in my hands; I was to kiss her

I had waited all my life for this

This full of love and compassionate kiss

I was just about to make my move

When suddenly rang sharply the phone

I picked the receiver angrily

My perfect moment it had interrupted

I froze when I heard his voice

How he spoke so gentle and nice

But what was he inside

I had known this all the time

He asked me about the presence of Charlie

"He is not at home, he is at the funeral," I told him

98

Charlie was visiting

The funeral of Harry

He simply hung up the phone on me

"Who was that?" Bella asked me

"It was Carlisle", I lied to her

He I didn't wish to remind her

Then suddenly Alice like wind

Entered the room, looking all shaken, breaking

"Bella, Edward!", "What?", "He thinks you are dead!"

"So you tell him that wrong news he had"

What is it to worry about?"

Then the call Alice asked me about

"It was Edward, Bella, Jacob lied to you

He thinks you are dead, he wants to die too

He has left for Italy to the Volturi

He would only stop after seeing you, only you can save him"

They both were hurriedly ready to leave

For last time, I asked, "Stay Bella, don't go, for me"

"I have to go", she answered me

And all alone there the car left me

99

I didn't know why this drama he was making

Did he want Bella to show him some sympathy?

I just wished that they get late

I just didn't want Edward to be safe

To return to take my Bella away from me

He had already done enough damage to Bella and me

She didn't return for three days

Angry fire through me raged

I told Charlie about bikes of her

Grounded I wanted Charlie to make her

I called when she had returned

Just to make sure she was breathing, un hurt

Edward had returned, how could he?

Such a shameless person I had never seen

Bella wasn't attending my calls

Not Charlie but Edward was making her reject them all

And when grounded she will be

She won't be able to spend time with him

There was also a very important thing

I wanted to remind Edward, the treaty

100

This was the only thing about which

I was a little hopeful, for due to it

He won't be able to change her

So he won't be able to forever keep her

Although to this thing I believed

That Bella herself won't agree

To change her into a blood drinker

To snatch her humanity from her

I had called them to meet me

Near Bella's home so I can tell him

About treaty, but Bella at my sight

At once angrily asked in a harsh voice

That why I had told Charlie

About bikes? What I wanted?

Before I could explain anything

Edward read my mind quickly

And told her all the unsaid things

He was good at this mind reading

About this Bella wasn't exaggerating

Then he with much respect and dignity

101

Thanked me for keeping Bella safe with me

When he didn't himself do it

Utterly thankful and grateful he was and said to me

If ever I needed any help from him

Before he could finish offering me his help

I said in my mind that the only help

Only favor he could ever do to me

Was to give Bella completely to me

"This I can't, its entirely in Bella's power

Jacob Black, I am a rather quick learner

I don't make a single mistake twice

I will forever stay, she will forever be mine

Unless her mind she changes

And to go away she orders me"

I then came to the real thing

I reminded him the points of treaty

That the treaty will be completely broken at the time

If the Cullens bite a human, it isn't kill, it just says "bite"'

And suddenly Bella became utterly angry

And comprehension dawned on me

102

So she had already decided to join the Cullen family

I was shaking, trembling trying to control my mind and body

Anger burned through every cell of my body

Soon Charlie called and they had to leave

What she was doing was insane, intolerable

She was giving up her life for that deceiving monster

I couldn't understand what she sees in him

I couldn't think why she could possibly believe him

I saw my destiny going away with him

And I knew that her destiny she considered him

But that day I promised myself one thing

That "I will always be there when she needs me

No matter what, their love won't affect our friendship"

As I was doubtless, completely confident that she too needed me

RENESMEE'S

LULLABY BY JACOB

BLACK

See how moonlight is playing with your curls

The moon is smiling on seeing you, there up above

How rosy are your cheeks, how your eyes keep shining

In a sweet voice you speak, like bells chiming

Neither a vampire nor a human

Could ever be this much beautiful

See how dimples play on your cheeks

You are more enchanting than fairies

You were growing so quickly

It made me so much worried

But now I know that

At youth you will stop to age

Sleep, my beautiful, sleep

And see some really pretty dreams

And then you can show them

All to me by placing your hand

On me; my mind is always welcoming

You to come into and have fun with me

104

I have never been able to

Show anyone my love completely

You will be amazed to see

How much I am capable of loving

I will be your big brother

When you are small and little

I will take so much care of you

No harm will ever come near you

And when you will be a growing teen

I will be your best friend

By your side always staying

Supporting you; on me you can always depend

Then as you stop ageing

Still you will be the only one

Who will be in my heart living

For my love you will be the one

I, a werewolf, and you

Half vampire, half human

Together will start, me and you

In love history a new chapter

So sleep, my love, sleep

Free of any care

At your side I will forever be

To your heart, so near

105

Bella and Edward

Me and you

Will live forever

With hopes anewed

106

AN ACCOUNT OF VAMPIRE POWERS

Edward Cullen

He is a mind reader

All the thoughts in your head

He can easily hear

Whether they are good or bad

Bella Cullen

She has the power to shield her mind

So she is called a shield

No one can penetrate her mind

Except for Renesmee

Renesmee Cullen

Has opposite powers of Edward and Bella

She can show you her thoughts by touching you

No one can block her not even Bella

You can't stop her even if you are a shield too

Alice Cullen

Oh God! She can see the future

Which depends on people's decisions

107

Change of decision can change the future

But knowing everything already gives a great impression

Jasper Hale

He can control the emotions of people

Can brighten or sadden your mood

Can calm you down when you are anxious

He can make you feel sleepy, too

Victoria

She had an amazing ability

To escape the situations completely deadly

James

He was a skilled tracker

But he was killed by Edward

Kate

She will give you high voltage electric shocks

By touching you with her bare palms

Later she had shifted this power

To her whole body, what a miracle!

Eleazar

He can see the supernatural powers possible

In both the vampires as well as humans

108

Benjamin

He can control the basic elements

Air, water, fire, earth; all of them

Maggie

She can tell when someone is lying

And when the truth someone is telling

Siobhan

Although she doesn't regard this as a power

But when she plans something to happen in a particular way

Then automatically her plan becomes successful

And the thing happens as she says

Zafrina

She can make people see

What she wants them to see

All other views and surroundings fade away

And you see everything in her thinking's way

Alistair

A tracker, though not nearly as precise and efficient as Demetri

He just feels an elusive pull towards whatever he is seeking

109

Aro

His power is very much similar to Edward's

But he needs a physical contact to hear one's thoughts

But unlike hearing only the present thoughts like Edward

He can listen to each and everything a person has ever thought

Marcus

He reads the strength of ties

Among humans as well as vampires

And looks for any weak points

Alec

He can make people lose all their senses

Sight, touch, speaking, feeling, hearing

So that you may be burning in fire and dying without even knowing

Thus, you can't take any action against your enemy

Jane

She can torture one to death

By just looking into one's eyes

She makes people experience a torture so immense

That can even kill vampires

110

Demetri

He is the tracker

Who is the best ever

Rinnata

Rinnata is also a shield

She can shield herself physically

And needs physical contact to shift

On other people her protective shield

Chelsea

She has influence over emotional ties between people

She can both loosen and secure these ties

Bonded to the Volturi may feel those people

Want to belong, want to please, to give up their lives

111

WHO IS HE??

He has the impossible speed and strength

The eye color shifting from gold to black and back again

The inhuman beauty, the pale cold skin

And at lunch he never seems to eat

He moves with a disturbing grace

He sometimes speaks with unfamiliar cadences and phrases

He skipped the class on the day of blood typing

He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where they were going

He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking except Bella

He'd said, "What if I'm the bad guy?" and had warned Bella

He is extremely completely perfect

He has not at all any defect

A Greek god of beauty

Carved in some unknown stone

Very loving and extremely sweet

He is the right one for you

You will drown in his gold eyes

Will be mesmerized by his honey voice

When he will play piano for you

Breathing won't be remembered by you

He has mesmerizing musical voice

And never ever gets any tired

He is the son of Dr. Carlisle

Once he had gone real wild

112

He never sleeps

He doesn't need to breathe

He smells very tempting

Just like sunshine and honey

He is venomous

He is immortal

Yes! Yes! You are right

He is our Edward Cullen!

113

CHARLIE ON BELLA'S

WEDDING

As I saw the daughter of mine

Coming down the stairs

Flashed before my eyes

All the past moments

Her childhood I remember

All the playful moments with her

She had been a naughty child never

Nor she did mischief ever

And how girls grow up so quickly

One moment they are eating from your hand

And next, food for you they are cooking

That's also what happened with my Bella

And the most difficult time comes

When your daughter returns home and its evident

That with some guy she has fallen in love

How every father prays that the guy be the one

The one he is also looking for

The one who deserves his daughter

Who is always the cause of happiness for

His daughter and sincerely loves her

114

Who gives her all she wants

So much loves her that becomes he

Her everything, never thinks at all

To hurt her even a least bit

My daughter was head over heels in love

With Edward Cullen; the son of Dr. Carlisle

He was her everything, her sole pure love

She used to say that he was her entire life

But in my heart there was some restlessness

Bella had completely forgotten others in her life

It was wrong, an obsession, said my subconscious

Only Edward was on her mind all the time

But he left her after few months

She was broken, lost completely

But still only him she loved

What to do? I was confused completely

I had been afraid of what

Had thus finally happened

By losing Edward Cullen

Bella's life was moving towards its end

I could not see her like this

In such a pain she was in

About which I could do nothing

But a hope I found in Jacob; although just a little

115

Jacob dearly loved her

He started to spend his time with her

Now she was becoming a little better

But a miracle, alas! Couldn't occur

A miracle that would make her

Forget all her pains

A miracle that would make her

Happy altogether again

Because she just couldn't change her mind

She just loved and loved and missed Edward

Although she was almost dead, barely alive

But the little life in her was still the memories of Edward

She was then for 3 days gone

And when returned Edward was with her

I couldn't understand all this at all

But her spirit, her life was back in her

I just couldn't trust Edward anymore

Even though he was the nicest guy I had ever seen

He had left once, he would do it no more

There was nothing to give guarantee

Moreover Edward was too serious a man

I wanted her to live with Jacob

Who had more spirit, fun and

Also he was trust worthy, thus better

116

But now when I see her

Coming down the stairs

With happiness was glinting the face of her

As if her destiny was about to be hers

So beautiful she looked

Like an innocent angel

At this moment so much I loved

To see that too happy was my angel

And all the time since his return

Edward had been completely honest,

Faithful, kind, respectful, giving love

To her; so peace drowned my chest

I was happier than she was now

I gave her and Edward all my blessings

May they always be happy together from now

Away all their pains may flee

May their faces always shine with glee

Although she had not always lived with me

But a different feeling, I also felt in me

She was no more the little girl of her daddy

Now she was mature and married

May this decision of hers

Proves to be right and always

Keep her happy, wipes away all her tears

117

A TORN SAM ULLEY

Oh God! I was in a difficult situation

Completely lost, drowned in confusion

Since this werewolf thing had happened to me

It seemed like I had been seeing a horrible dream

First the irritation, the harshness of phasing

Then to gain control very hardly working

Moreover, alone in this situation; having none like me

To whom I could talk about this, my pains I share with

And my love life was falling apart

Since school I was in love with Leah

I was about to propose her to marry me

When this horrible stuff happened to me

And as if I was destined to be doomed

A thing named imprinting existed too

It snatched my Leah from me

As I had imprinted on Emily

I didn't do it deliberately

I just had no power over this

It was such a strong attraction

Towards Emily that everything else became forgotten

118

I felt an intense pull towards her

I could think of no one but her

Thus I had fallen in love with her completely

Leah was thus deceived, broken by me

Now whenever she looked at me

Her eyes always blamed me of deceiving

I had destroyed her life; it was already too much a pain

That another thing happened to rip me apart again

That day I was standing

Too close to Emily

When I had lost control

And phased into a werewolf

Due to my closeness with her

My sharp claws scarred her

Face forever, it was a punishment for me

Of a mistake not committed by me

Thus, first I myself become broken

Then I made two lovely ladies broken

And still I could do nothing to change the situation

No matter how much I tried it wasn't in my power

And who was to be blamed for all this?

The Cullens; the vampires had induced this

All these changes in me were their blessing

Just hearing their name made me furiously angry

119

We werewolves were destined to save people

From these blood thirsty demons

Although, the Cullens were different, nice

But they were still vampires

So I could not control but hate them

A treaty we had made with them

If they don't bite people, don't kill

We will from humans keep their secret

Their long stay had induced these

Horrible changes in me

No matter how much I tried

I couldn't change my life

It's just that this cruel life

Doesn't always give you what you desire

I have to struggle, I have to fight

As this is the ugly fate of mine

120

JANE'S HISTORY

Have you people ever wondered?

What caused this evil power?

To come into my eyes

Enabling me to take lives?

When I was born

My parents became more torn

Because already to four girls

My mother had given birth

So I was of no importance to them

I was just a burden on them

I had always been neglected

By both parents, by all siblings

These conditions played havoc with my mind

A permanent expression of hatred froze in my eyes

I cared about nothing, I liked nothing

I hated everything, trying to break them as I was myself breaking

One day, it just became too much and rage roared inside me

Of my home I completely destroyed everything

Anger burned in my eyes, I left my home for good

And went out alone in a night so cold

121

In the dark night I saw

And my mouth hung open with awe

Two most beautiful men I had ever seen

Staring strangely as if interested in me

"Aro" one of them said, "Yes? Eleazar"

"I see in this girl the greatest potential so far

I have ever seen in humans"

I couldn't listen more; their voice had dropped low into whisper

"Will you come with us, child?" Aro asked me

"As majestic as us we will make thee"

Still frozen with awe I couldn't resist this

It was all my decision that could cause this

Eleazar such picked me up

As if I was as light as a feather

With such speed they moved

I couldn't see anything on the way anymore

Then next day, somewhere in the valley of Kashmir

Eleazar carefully came towards me and bit me

Stinging currents of pain bolted through my body

I asked them to kill me, I begged for mercy

And the next thing I knew

Was that my throat was burning

Thirst of blood maddened me

Yeah, changed I had been

122

I was extremely happy by this

Such strength and speed was in me

I was now even more enchanting than the men

But there was something more, that only I had

There was some strange power in my eyes

I could torture someone to death, snatch his life

By just staring hatefully, concentrating, wanting

To cause extreme torture to him

Now I understood what was meant by Eleazar

That I had the greatest potential by far

A loyal friend of Aro, I have been ever since

Servicing him, joined his clan and finally happy

123

ROBERT PATTINSON

SAYS

Of being famous I don't feel any advantage

As with my life now, I am quite happy

I still have the same two friends I've had

Since I was twelve, and I can't see it changing

I hope success hasn't really changed me at all

Because I don't feel even a little different at all

I guess my friends would have to judge me

But really nothing different is felt by me

My parents are always saying

That they are very proud of me

But why, because done by me is nothing

Just pure luck it is

Up until I was 12 my sis's

As a girl liked to dress me

And then they would introduce me

As, "Claudia", their little sis

I started doing a newspaper round

When just ten, I was about

124

Always pretty bad my school reports were

I never ever did my homework

I always turned up for lessons

As I liked my teachers

But it was said by report of mine

That very hard I didn't try

At school I wasn't at all focused

And so I couldn't achieve much

But now I've got a sense of urgency

I can't let anymore time waste away, I feel

A bunch of girls in a café my dad spotted

And they were all really excited

So he asked them where they had been

They told him to drama classes they had been

He reckoned when this he heard

That I should get myself down there

For Guys and Dolls I auditioned

And got a little part as some Cuban dancer

Then in next play the lead part I got

And then, my agent I got

I was modeling at twelve

The youngest person in my agency

Out of the boys or the girls

I was so ridiculously skinny

125

I wouldn't be acting if it

Wasn't for Barnes Theatre Club

I owe my everything

To that little club

That stuff of a way, in weird sort

The best that I had ever done

And the stuff I am most proud of

When I started

Like a girl I looked

I was quite tall

And had an androgynous look

So I got

Lots of jobs

Because in that period the androgynous look

Was really supposed to be cool

I set out to be an actor? Never

But if it fell apart ever

I'd be quite annoyed

Because doing it, I quite enjoy

Oh, Jesus! I used to get told I looked like Prince William

From Harry Potter! Ah, its terrible

It's the worst thing you could possibly have said

I am trying to get away from that

Whole stigma of the

Floppy English posh person

126

I was so conscious of the fact on Harry Potter

That I didn't know what I was doing

I was always throwing up

On the side of the set I used to sit

The bit I was looking

Most forward to doing

Was the cemetery scene

No one has died in it

So it's always going to be the first

Death in Harry Potter

It was cool, one of the best parts

I think, of the part

With Katie I get on really well

She's a really cool girl

I dance with her and like holding hands

There're a lot of scenes and stuff like that

I hadn't done a part that big

Before, so it felt interesting

With the best, most famous actors I was working

So it was all really fun, really exciting

I realized I needed to learn some,

Like how to act, the fundamentals

My best acting experience was

For BBC2, The Haunted Airman

127

In which I play a pilot of Second World War

Who gets shot and paralyzed and basically goes insane

Starts to wash itself, my hair

If you don't wash it for six weeks

You won't have to wash it again ever

Unbearable, until gets it

I hope there is such a thing

As a soul mate

I guess it would be quite scary

To find a soul mate

When you are young

Because you are probably going to mess it up

I was glad to play Dali

I never worked as hard before for anything

And I was glad I did it

When I was first cast for twilight

75,000 fans petitioned against me

That was my welcome to twilight

But I mean I expected it

Edward is described as this perfect man

That description of impeccable body and face

Everything about him

Is just amazing

And there's no way that

I could ever live up to that

128

For more quotes of Rob you can see

The Robert Pattinson album by Paul Stenning

Now I will discuss my personal views on him

But first tell me who are the ones who petitioned against him

Were they joking? Out of their minds?

To petition against such a cool guy

But now we've all realized that Robert Pattinson

Is really deserving to be our Edward Cullen

And Kristen Stewart was absolutely right

When during selecting cast she took Rob's side

Refused to play her part if Pattinson

Wasn't to be cast as Edward Cullen

Rob, Kristen herself says that

Is very organic and really brave

That he is a really courageous actor

And he is always in the moment

And what an amazing on screen Chemistry

Was between Kristen and Patty

Which has now started Robsten

Craze in fans of both Rob and Kristen

Catherine Hardwicke; the director

Of Twilight says about Pattinson

That finding Edward was a real challenge

Not many actors could live upto his image

That pale skin, that otherworldly beauty

But Pattinson was different, he had everything

Which they needed like that angular face

And the mysterious Edward aura he had

129

These two great women

Just can't be wrong about Pattinson

And this is further proved by the fact

That millions of crazy fans around the globe he has

He was destined for fame

Because he worked as much hard as a person can

And then his devotion to the role of Edward

To spend months of loneliness to study his character

Was really fruitful of course, see the perfectness he

Has delivered to his role on screen in all the films

The best thing about him is that he doesn't pretend

To show that he feels something 100% when he really doesn't

Then comes his great voice

In especially "Never think" and "Let me sign"

It honestly feels as if

Edward is himself singing

But Rob stays humble and says that

"You get a bit of heat and everybody says you are this, you are that

Then it dies down", so he is realistic too

So Ransom Spunk, all our best wishes and prayers to you

Be successful, keep rocking

But never give up your humility

130

THE END
