Julius E. Raht was an actual living person and was a true mining pioneer of the era. His life has been fictionalized to embellish the story.

Copper Basin, Tennessee 1872

Ann Marie Ward stepped into the cool shade of the small weathered cabin. Releasing a deep breath, she eyed the large brass tub occupying most of the far right corner of the solitary room she called home. As weariness crept into every bone in her body she immediately discarded any thoughts of using the large ornate reservoir. She refused to even think about carrying the many heavy buckets of water to fill it. She couldn't even imagine the sweltering heat from a fire if she wished for warm water. Running her hands through her shoulder length hair, a color so much like the shade of the precious copper painstakingly obtained from the local mines, she winced as her fingertips came away encrusted with grit.

"Ug!" She groaned aloud in protest of the grime caking her scalp, and absentmindedly twisted the short locks around her finger. They stayed just as that, a matted curl, molded by sweat and red clay dirt. "To the creek it is, she barked with more enthusiasm than she really felt. A lazy tabby striped feline lounging on her bed opened one eye and yawned before settling back into a comfortable position. "Tiger, boy, you would feel the same way if your fur were this dirty. I swear there is more red clay dust in those mines than all of the state of Tennessee, I think!

While grabbing her wrapper from its place on the wall, her hand gently brushed the longer portion of her locks hanging on the adjoining peg and not from her head. She sighed with a twinge of regret. It had been painful to cut off her hair. Ralph Williams, a dear man she considered a God Uncle, had concocted the hairpiece from the cut length, artfully securing the loose end with twine into a ponytail attachment. At least she could wear hair on Sunday for church! At least when she wasn't working, she could be herself! At least... She stopped her fruitless train of thought as it had all been very, very necessary. She thought back to the day of that fateful decision.

"Blaze," He began by calling her by her childhood nickname, "It ain't quite the same I know, but at you can wear this ponytail to make ya feel better until ya can grow it back out. I know ya Pa would have had my hide by letting ya cut it off. It were his pride and joy, it was. It was like your Mama's hair." His voice became a bit sterner then. "But I'll not be in total agreement here with you working for that rich man Bergmann and all. Your Pa would have more than my hide if something happens to you in that mine. It ain't right. He wanted you to be raised a gentle woman. Your Pa did everything in his power to bring you up as such. Your Mama would have liked that, rest her soul. He wanted you to be every bit as educated like her, as if you were one of J.E. Raht's daughter's herself." He referred to the wealthiest family in the area. "And what ya gonna do if Bergmann finds out?"

Jolting back to the present, a tear slid down her filthy face, leaving a trail in the dust on a lightly tanned cheek. Her Pa. He was probably rolling over in his grave right if he knew all the events that had taken place since his death. She knew Ralph was right. Her father had forever mourned the loss of his fair copper-haired wife who had died in childbirth trying to give him a son. This left him a broken man, living only to dote on their child, albeit a female. He had adored her hair which had never been cut. He lavished his life blood and earthly riches on her, sparing no expense despite his meager miner's income and beyond for her education and needs. The townspeople considered him foolish because it was a firmly held belief that an education was wasted on a woman. The only reasons he was not shunned as an outsider was due to his outgoing, friendly nature and his superb furniture making skills. He was always there for anyone who asked to lend a helping hand or to fulfill a household need. He could take a worthless heap of scrap wood and create a functionally exquisite item fit to grace the finest of homes, then he would sell it for almost nothing. To her knowledge, he never turned anyone away. When Ann was old enough to question his generosity, he stood by his actions. "Blaze Ann, kindness has no price. These people have fallen on hard times like us. It's just the way it works. One day, we may need their help."

Yet that help never arrived as his kind-heartedness was quickly forgotten and his adoration had become her ruin. Creditors quickly descended upon her for unpaid loans. People who had often asked for his helping hand now cornered her with outstretched palms demanding payments. She sadly recalled how she had been forced to sell everything to cover the debts he incurred because of her, including the modest but comfortable family home he had built. It had been the only place she had ever lived, and her losses seemed to have no ending. The only thing she had been able to keep was her mother's brass tub. She just could not let it go. It took up a fair portion of this small miner's cabin, but it was the one earthly symbol of her childhood she had left to call her own, if she could keep making those darn payments to Keith Roberts, the town loan shark. She had reluctantly asked his assistance for those few final bills, listing the tub as collateral. There was nowhere else to turn as the region did not have a financial institution of bank. That type of establishment was untrusted. She mentally tallied the remaining three more payments then the loan would be paid in full. To earn a living, she had taken a job as a miner. This wasn't exactly the ideal position for a young lady of gentle rearing, not to mention it was an inconvenience to be forced to live in disguise. All the men in the crew knew her secret and had known her all her life. It was sort of like having a varied collection of fathers who kept her identity quiet out of respect for Pa's memory. They quickly learned to appreciate her skills and abilities in the maze of tunnels weaving a dangerous web beneath the town. The wage was modest, the work was backbreaking, and ironically it required none of her ridiculed education or high learning. So much for all her fancy schooling now!

In one way she considered it lucky that the new foreman wasn't from around these parts and didn't know his crew well. Mr. Dirk Bergmann didn't need to be privy to that small piece information, and her fellow miners had made a pact to keep it quiet. She rarely ventured into town, using her grief as an excuse to only attend church or purchase what few staples she needed then quickly retreat to her cabin. Her livelihood depended on discretion. Even the townsfolk weren't privy to her dual life. She had assured Ralph that this was a temporary solution almost eight months ago, wondering how much longer the situation would hold.

The team she worked with in Mary Mine had not been formally supervised for quite some time as the former overseer had moved to nearby Cleveland. They were an experienced group and were doing fine, until Bergmann. He had entered their life with a better way to do everything or so he claimed. He was an arrogant man who had been formally educated in Germany with high ideas and notions.

With just enough of the local influence ingrained into her persona, Ann ranted about the interloper. "Oh why did that wealthy dandy have to make his entrance into my life?!" She grabbed for a bar of soap and slammed the cabin door, causing Tiger to give her a sharp look of disdain before repositioning himself yet again. "If not for him, I could have kept my hair long. I wouldn't have to bind my breasts. I wouldn't have to cover my face with a bandana. I wouldn't have to constantly watch what I do or say!" Her anger was a welcomed over sadness and self-pity. "Bergmann. Bah!" She spat the name of a man she had never met face to face. Angry steps propelled her in the direction of Potato Creek. How was it possible to hate a man you didn't even know?

As if listening to her ranting frustration, Diedrick "Dirk" Bergmann stood on a bare red clay hill surveying the devastated landscape around him. As far as he could see, the sloping mounds were devoid of all vegetation. The bare rolling hills appeared slightly fuzzy from the breeze that stirred a blanket of dust to blow freely to the wind. Craters riddled the earth's surface and were so deep that a grown man could hide in them while standing erect. It was a shame what copper mining had done to this once resplendent area, and he hoped he could change the direction of destruction. The smelting process required to heat the mined ore was doubly damaging to all living things. Smelting needed fuel for fires and coal was rare and unavailable. Thus the fuel of choice was cordwood. To date, fifty square miles of timber had been stripped and burned from the area, leaving behind a vast desert of barren red clay. As a double edged sword, the fumes produced from smelting were obviously toxic because even the wildlife had evacuated or died. It was common knowledge that one couldn't hang their clothing out on a line to dry as the material would soon become riddled with pinholes. Mysterious lung illnesses were prevalent among the people here, especially the miners. As a young man who owed everything to the Raht family, he felt it was his duty to try to make the Mary Mine profitable again after a long dry spell and rectify the ecological situation to the best of his ability.

Dirk Bergmann had been born an orphan. As a small child, his only means of support was pick-pocketing the wealthy and that was exactly how he met Julius E. Raht. Mr. Raht had been on holiday in his homeland in Dillengurg, Duchy of Nassau, Germany with his family when he almost became a victim of theft. Heralded as the best on the street, Dirk still recalled his surprised reaction as his deft arm was stilled by the observant copper mine superintendent. He recalled the fear as clearly as if it had happened yesterday, knowing he would likely spend the rest of his life in prison.

Mr. Raht had taken pity on the overly thin lad so close in age to his sons, taking him under his wing and providing him with an education. He had worked for Raht his entire life, been offered an education by the generous father-like figure, and now he had been given the opportunity of a lifetime - Mine Foreman. He owned it all to Raht and he wasn't going to disappoint him. Shaking off the shadows of his past, he watched a small figure in the distance stomp jauntily toward a small stream. One of the lads who worked in the mine, no doubt, he mused. At least the boy had a penchant for cleanliness but who wouldn't in this veritable desert of red grit and dirt? With each gust of wind, Dirk's eyes stung from the blowing orange-red grit.

Ann gingerly stepped into the brisk stream. It wasn't very deep naturally, but as it had become a favorite area for swimming and bathing, a small pool had been hand dug out to accommodate the user. In a graceful arc, she dove under, squealing with delight as the stress of the day was magically washed away by the cool clear water. She surfaced briefly, shook out her hair, then dove beneath the surface with a splash again and again. It truly felt good!

Dirk turned once more at the sound of delight. He caught a glimpse of the lad in the stream just as he dove under. Another smile came easily. After such a grueling day's work, the boy deserved some measure of pleasure.

After a few more dives, a hasty wash, and a speedy rinse, Ann checked the sun's position then quickly finished her bath. A gnawing ache in her stomach was all the prompting she needed to hasten her efforts even more. Shaking out her wrapper and enveloping her slender body in its generous folds, she briskly towel dried her hair. Another growl from her midsection spurred her on her way back toward her cabin.

If Dirk Bergmann had remained in place a few moments longer or had chanced to take one last backward look, even from his vantage point he would have easily recognized the turn of a shapely calf and the outline of slender feminine curves beneath a course wrapper.

Ralph watched Ann scurry into view, catching a whiff of her favored lavender scented soap long before she plopped down beside him. "Blaze!" He admonished her. "Ya smell like a sissy boy." Handing her a small napkin wrapped package, he paused as she threw back the red and white checkered cloth and smiled at the golden chunk of cornbread and the steaming bowl of beans. "Ya smell too pretty." He tried to continue his tirade.

Stuffing her mouth full, she nodded as she mumbled unintelligible words between bites.

"Blaze" His voice attempted to remain stern. "I mean it. Bergmann is going to be working with us tomorrow. Ya can't be smellin' like a milk fed dandy. It'll raise too much suspicion. Although I'd be happy to see you lay this charade aside tonight, I know it ain't possible for ya right now. It's risky enough. I rightly can't see how the man can't tell you're a lass not a lad! It's as obvious as the nose on my face. I swear. The man don't have much of an eye, I recon..." Ralph rambled on as she continued to enjoy her meal. "Ya getting quite some blisters on your hands despite the work gloves." He clasped her wrist and inspected her hand. "Now remember, you need to take extra caution tomorrow and every day that Bergmann's present until he gets tired of babysitting us. Gloves. Baggy clothes. Cover your face with a bandana. Don't smell so good. Bergmann don't need to discover nothin more than copper in those mines.

Mumbling as she nodded, she was sure she had this situation under control as hunger ruled her train of thought.

Morning came early as expected, but was not eagerly anticipated. Tiger pranced around the small cabin while demanding his breakfast. Ann stretched lazily, testing her body for fresh aches and pains. Despite the time she had spent in the mines lately she could always identify a new sore muscle or joint. Her morning routine was brief, a definite plus for the male population, and she dipped her fingers into a pot of mud and smeared on her face. Grimacing, she picked up yesterday's clothes and gave them a precursory smell. "Ug!" They would do. Wrinkling her nose, she was shocked how bad her own sweat could smell. For a final touch to her disguise, she dipped soured washcloth in water and spread it over her arms.

Her arrival to the worksite garnered the desired reaction from her coworkers. "Pee-Yew! Blaze! Take a Bath!"

"Did you tangle with a skunk?"

"Is that new perfume called evening in the cow pasture?"

She cut a saucy grin their way just before covering the entire lower half of her face with a worn blue bandana. To save herself the agony, she had dabbed just a drop of lavender water inside the bandana so she didn't have endure her own smell! She giggled, conjuring a vision of herself standing as close as possible to Bergmann every chance she could get.

Dirk arrived shortly after all the miners had descended below ground for the day. He eyed the shaft that disappeared deep into the bowels of the earth and took a breath. It was not an experience he was looking forward to but was necessary. He gently stepped into the basket and gave the command to be lowered. After the seemingly endless trip down, he noted that the men worked furiously like underground ants. The extraction of the ore was a manual process, and their only tools were picks and shovels. A young boy who looked barely out of childhood darted back and forth with a container, loading the ore into the bucket lift. Ole Bess, the mule who pulled the lift, stood patiently as the boy adjusted the load to be distributed evenly in the bucket. Bess' reward was a scratch between the ears by the lad. The boy, called Blaze startled when he saw Dirk Bergmann observing him.

Ann came to a complete stop when she saw the tall, handsome man watching her. His dark blond hair was the perfect foil for those piercing blue eyes. They were the color of a stormy lake in summer. Dark, stormy, silvery blue. Her heart skipped a beat and she had trouble catching her breath. Breaking the spell held over her, she immediately went back to her chores.

Dirk blinked, and then decided that the mule smelled better than the boy.

Blaze shot dirk a scowl. "Don't make any strange moves around Ole Bess. She's blind, ya know, from being down here her whole life. No sunlight, ya know. Don't want ya to startle her and cause problems, ya know."

Bess sidestepped uneasily from Dirk's foreign scent. The seasoned animal knew every miner by their smell and had even recognized Ann in disguise.

"A pity." He murmured.

"What?" Blazed asked. "Beg pardon?"

"A pity to ruin a good animal with neglect." He stated.

"Neglect? Maybe. Necessity? Definitely." Blaze reflected on his concern. She, too, had felt pity for the poor mule in its condition, but for the sake of the job and the safety of the men, there was no other way to reliably transport people and ore in and out of the mines. Just knowing that Ole Bess had been imprisoned in a mining dungeon her whole life had made her cry for days. But that was life in Copper Basin, and she had might as well get used to it if she was going to survive.

Those blue eyes turned their attention to the cloudy eyed beast. "That can and will be changed. That is a promise."

"Change ain't welcomed much around here." Blaze stated fact.

Her statement was a verbal confirmation of what he already knew. Carefully measuring his words, he replied with caution. "Change for the sake of change is just chaos. Change should bring improvement. In this case, improvement is needed."

Secretly agreeing, Blaze allowed herself to shoot him an insolent look before returning to work. She couldn't agree more, but she wasn't about to give him that satisfaction.

The days passed by while taking on a scripted pattern, and true to his word, Dirk Bergmann began to introduce and implement new processes which truly did make the job easier. Begrudgingly, she found herself an admirer of the milk-fed dandy as he seemed anything but. As she realized her feelings of attraction toward him, she strengthened her disguise daily, making sure to add an extra swipe of soured water or mud on herself. It was a feeling akin to a wild animal caught in a trapper's cage. Maybe it was her imagination, but she could almost feel her eyes boring holes in her skin throughout the day.

Ann would have been truly frightened if she knew how close her feelings were to the truth. Dirk ground his teeth in frustration as the lad sprinted in a jaunty run past him for the tenth time that morning. How one human being could smell so incredibly bad, he wondered? How could one fowl smelling boys possess such a shapely derriere, he shook the vision from his brain. Absentmindedly giving Ole Bess a scratch between the ears, he felt a measure of uneasiness with himself. It had to be the bad air in this mine shaft!

Blaze wafted by yet again, her progress halted abruptly by a steely hand on her shoulder. "Whaaaaa?" She didn't have to try to be belligerent as the grip of his hand caused a ripple of lightening through her body. Involuntarily she jerked but his hold held her in place.

"Have you ever heard of a bath, boy?"

Her body stiffened in response. "Don't need no bath. Ain't good for ye."

"I can assure they will not kill you." Dirk mentally conjured an image of the young lad who trekked to Potato Creek daily. "And your coworkers, especially me, would appreciate it."

Everyone in the vicinity stopped what they were doing to watch the spectacle. Ralph was literally holding his breath in fear. They all were. It could be more volatile than a powder charge in the hole.

"It ain't Saturday. Bath day is Saturday." Her voice cracked with breathlessness, not sounding at all masculine to her drumming ears. Jerking away, she knew she had to break their contact.

Dirk felt it too. The palm of his hand seared with tingling heat. He again felt very uneasy. The boy was unusually small for a male his age. His shoulders were slight, almost bony, and Dirk winced something inside threatened to betray him. Swallowing hard, he justified his response as pity. "I feel pity for the boy. That could have been me." He told himself, refusing to acknowledge his unusual emotions.

Their gazes locked for a full minute before returning to reality. Blaze knew that was a close call. She would have to be much more careful in the future.

She reported to work the next day smelling twice as bad as usual. Not only had she literally doused herself with soured water, she trampled through every pile of Tiger's dung as she crossed her yard. It was enough to make her gag as the small drop of lavender water in her bandana didn't make a dent in the stench. No one remained in her presence very long that day, and that was good enough for her! Ralph kept glaring warning looks at her every chance he could get. As for Bergmann... well his look was priceless!

During lunch break, Blaze made sure to seat herself downwind from Bergmann. Beneath the brim of the oversized hat she wore, she watched a myriad of expressions cross his face while he shifted uncomfortably throughout his meal. Finally he threw down his food and stalked off, but not before glaring her way with a look of irritation and something else she couldn't fathom. Her heart ached just a little because she would have loved to have met him under different circumstances. "Harrumph." She grunted out loud as she reminded herself she was Blaze, not Ann. Rising from the ground, she aimed to follow him and make his presence here miserable. Maybe if she succeeded, he would leave sooner than planned.

Dirk finally gave into his irritation, tossing the remainder of his lunch down before stalking away. What little he had eaten was sitting in his belly like a lump of copper ore. In contrast to the stomach turning smell wafting from the insolent boy was an uneasy vision of an unwhiskered, delicate, almost too pretty jawline. Following the effeminate line of the jawbone, Dirk encountered two rosy pink lips nibbling furiously at food being shoved in with small but efficient hands. The soft color of the boy's lips in combination with those feline green eyes... "Well Hell!" Dirk spoke aloud as he all but bolted by Blaze as if his pants were on fire. Maybe he wasn't any better than the gutter trash around him in his pickpocket days. Maybe he couldn't rise above the early years of his life. Maybe his destiny cursed. This had always been his greatest fear, and Raht had always assured him it was not inbred into a person. "Hell!" He swore again. He made himself a promise to find a willing woman, and soon. Not that he had ever had a problem in that area, he considered the females of his past. Could it be possible that he had become one of those depraved men who were driven to satisfy their own needs regardless? Clearing his troubled thoughts, he wondered how one young boy, a child, could cause him so much doubt and discomfort. But when the dynamite shipment arrived, which should be soon, he could rotate himself out of this position and off this job. He would discuss the situation with Raht and take a new position somewhere. Any position would do as long as it took him away from defiant green eyes and disgusting feelings.

Blaze watched the sulking figure retreat and briefly pondered why her heart felt as if it were going to break. She had to admit that Dirk Bergmann wasn't at all the man she believed him to be. While being honest with herself she knew his ideas were actually improvements, but the old timers were set in their way. His suggestions had been rejected by all despite their merit. Why, Earl Morrow wouldn't have been burned just today if he had been using the newfangled safety lamp instead of an open flame oil lamp as Bergmann had suggested and supplied. Ole Bess was going to be freed from her dungeon as soon as the new steam powered whim was installed, yet the men kept procrastinating with that too. Bergmann had also provided each worker with a metal hat to protect their heads, a great idea in Blaze's opinion, but those too were discarded in favor of their old felt headgear. Blaze, however, had nestled one on her head and kept it hidden beneath her oversized cap. The old timers might be skeptical, but she felt it was the safe thing to do. She just had to keep it hidden so she wouldn't be labeled as a traitor in their eyes!

As the day's last whistle blew, Blaze was congratulating herself on avoiding Bergmann for the rest of the shift when that familiar steely hand rested gently yet firmly on her shoulder again. An involuntary shudder passed through her like the rippling of disturbed water. She squirmed uncomfortably beneath his touch and the unfamiliar feelings it invoked.

"Blaze." There was a slight hitch in Bergmann's voice as he felt the boy tremble from head to toe. "Bath day is Saturday. I expect you'll arrive at work on Monday Morning smelling quite a bit better than usual. It would just be considered respect toward your coworkers and boss." Sternly eyeing all the men who had paused to watch the spectacle, he continued. "That is just a reminder. At this time, Mr. Raht considered me to be the boss of this mine. I don't want to come in here and upset the apple cart, but there are some changes needed, and they will take place here." The warning was spoken to all, then Dirk left the the crowd to their grumbling and complaints for the peacefulness of his new home.

Ann was ever so glad to put "Blaze" aside as she soaked for over an hour in the tub until the lavender scent no longer enveloped her and the water was too tepid even for the heat of summer. Tiger remained in his place of honor on the bed, occasionally opening an eye in response to her endless stream of chatter. Reverend Brown would be singing praises to the angels if he knew that attending his Sunday Sermon had become her favorite event of the week! As long as she could recall, his preaching had not incited anything except restlessness in her bones. Now she actually looked forward to dressing in her finery and sitting quietly with hands folded for an hour or two or sometimes three if the good Reverend felt the calling!

Sunday morning arrived brightly and Ann carefully tended her hairpiece, attaching it to her growing locks. The small straw bonnet she chose was trimmed in a deep kelly green that exactly matched her dress and called attention to her eyes. The ensemble had been a gift from Pa on her eighteenth birthday. A dress befitting a beautiful young woman, he had proclaimed. The deep golden trim around the neck also complemented the gold flecks in her eyes. Pa always did know how to dress his little girl! His treasure, he would declare with hand over heart, all copper and emerald and gold. Slipping on a pair of lace gloves to complete her outfit, she inspected her work worn hands to make sure they were well camouflaged. "Tiger, I'll be back soon." She called to the lazy cat as she left the cabin.

Dirk's heart felt as if it were caught in his throat as the copper-haired vision in green took a seat directly across the aisle from him. He recognized Ralph taking a seat next to her. Surely that wasn't the old man's wife, or at least he hoped not. Could it be his daughter? He choked on his own thoughts as she turned to face him and he was captivated by the greenest eyes he had ever seen... on a woman. By golly, it seemed that Blaze had a sister. Clenching his fists, he attempted to slow his racing heart. A sister. His body's response reinforced his manhood and integrity and he begged forgiveness from his maker for having such feelings in His house. He had to meet this woman. He would meet this woman. She was a vision.

Ann's eyes locked with Dirk's in a silent battle. She instantly knew he could not meet her as a woman. That would never do! Tapping Ralph on the shoulder, she asked him to trade places with her in the pew. As soon as the sermon ended, she managed to disappear into thin air.

Dirk was disappointed that he did not get to meet the young lady in green, but from what he could gather from local's ongoing conversations, she was still mourning the loss of her father. He vowed to have an introduction, and soon.

"Whew! That was close!" Ann thanked Ralph for his assistance in her hasty exit. He had covered her escape as she literally crawled under the pews to the back door, a trick she had performed many times as a child but never an adult.

"Blaze. This ain't going to work much longer. Lass, Bergmann ain't no dummy and he saw yer beauty. Ye won't be able to hide much longer."

"I know, I know." She reassuringly patted his arm. "I only have three more payments on that loan and Mama's tub won't be collateral anymore. I know this is a dangerous game, but I can't lose that tub. It's all I have left and when the loan is paid off, I am free and clear of any debt Pa left behind. I want the problem cleared up and to go away before anyone else in town hears about it. You know as well as me if the townsfolk get word of this, my name is ruined. You know how, well, close-minded they are." She tried to think of a polite way to describe the township majority.

"Well ye be careful, girl. Be careful."

Blaze's arrival at the Mary Mine produced some very puzzled looks from the crew. Instead of her usual rancid odor, she smelled of lavender. Ralph's mask of disapproval was met with mischievous eyes as she secured her bandana tightly.

Throwing caution to the wind, she paraded by her equally disapproving boss and sassed, "Smellin good enough for ya, Mistah Bergmann?" To add a finishing touch to the sarcasm, she batted her eyes with exaggerated effort as she sashayed by.

Dirk's arm shot out, gripping her shoulder none too gently. "Young man," he clenched out between clenched teeth, "enough of this show. We have an important task to accomplish today and your frippery is not going to stand in the way of progress."

Blaze gave him a questioning look.

He continued. "I received the shipment of dynamite yesterday. We are going after that copper vein that Lloyd found last week. If my instincts prove correct, we should have enough mineral from the ore to produce quite a bit profit. Now everyone gather and let's plan our strategy."

Ralph threw his arm around Blaze's shoulder as they walked away from the dispersing group. "I don't like it. I don't like it one bit."

With a resigned sigh, Blaze agreed. "I don't either, but it can't be helped. I have to complete the assigned task or Bergmann will be suspicious. I'm so close to paying off that loan, Ralph."

"But ye know ya Pa never let you around explosives. Too dangerous, especially for one without experience."

"Maybe for Ann, but it is expected of Blaze to do this." She took a deep breath. "And for a short time longer, I must be Blaze."

Ralph turned her to face him and gave a stern lecture. "And after today, this stops. This has become too dangerous in more ways than one. Bergmann ain't dumb, and you ain't exactly a strapping young lad. I mean it. At quittin time today, Blaze the boy is no more." He countered the denial crossing her face. "This is it. I mean it."

"But the last couple of payments on Mama's tub..." She reminded him again.

"We will figure it out. It ain't worth it. Blaze, ye are all I have left and ye are like my own. I won't have you in harm's way no longer."

"I'm sure we can work this out." She pleaded.

"Oh we will, and you are outta this disguise after today. That's final."

*****

Blaze watched as Elbert deftly drilled a hole where the dynamite would be placed. It was her task to crawl into the narrow cavern and place the explosive deep into the drilled hole. She swallowed hard as Elbert's long arms blurred with speed as he powered the hand cranked drill. The area where she was to mount the dynamite was at the end of a canal about three feet deep and two feet wide.

Shuffling her feet into the dusty earth, she felt a hand clamp onto her shoulder. It was Bergmann. "Now remember, you just slide in there and place the stick of dynamite into the hole. There is no risk of explosion as the dynamite will be detonated by the contraption I showed you. I will be the one pushing down the switch and I can assure you that nothing will happen until you are at the safety point with the entire crew." Bergmann winked at Blaze. "Even if I am irritated with you for dousing yourself in your sister's perfume today, I am committed to keeping your mangy hide safe. Now what she decides to do to you for your theft if, and when she discovers it, is totally out of my hands."

Blaze shot a puzzled look his way then absently sniffed her wrist through the bandana. So he thought she had a sister! Good. A lot could be explained away with that assumption. A wry, unseen grin formed on her face as he handed her the cold stick of explosive then walked toward the safety area.

Only she and Elbert were left in the blast zone and she turned her attention back to the drilling, hoping it took a bit longer so she could calm her jittery nerves. They seemed to be on edge every time he touched her! Taking one more deep breath, she repeated his words in her mind and realized he was correct. There was no danger with the new-fangled dynamite explosive. He had explained the workings of this new mining tool to the skeptical crew and had assured them it could make the Mary Mine a very profitable site. The effectiveness was maximal and the risk was minimal since the detonator was not triggered with an open flame. Every man would be secure behind a safety wall, away from the blast. It was then she noticed Elbert from the corner of her eye as he muttered something about black powder and the old ways. The drilling was obviously completed.

Abruptly Elbert backed away from the site and grumbled, "It's all yours. Be careful."

After a moment's pause, Blaze gripped the dynamite and shimmied into the hole. The smell of freshly dug dank earth assaulted her senses and she felt blindly for the spot that had been drilled. Dang, why had it been placed so deep in the tunnel? Stretching out like a cat in a sunbeam, she struggled to fit the explosive into place. She stretched a little more. There it was. The end of the stick was just touching the opening of the hole. Lying face down, burying her nose into the earth, she extended to her farthest reach then shoved the dynamite into place with as much force as she could muster without tearing loose the wire connecting it to the switch.

A deafening sound filled her ears. She had no time to think. No time to escape. Her world went black.

Dirk had been waiting on Blaze in the corridor when a fine spray of dirt and rock covered him. "Damn!" He rushed headlong into the flying debris, his first thought being that this couldn't, no shouldn't be happening. He had placed and triggered many charges without incident. He had to get to the boy!

Unknown to Dirk, Ralph was close on his heels. Neither man spoke as they began to clean away the rubble covering the slight form. All at once, every man was working toward a common goal. No words were spoken, just condemning looks given, all in Bergmann's direction.

Ralph was the first to recover the intact dynamite stick. He gave his boss a questioning look before looking more closely at the situation. It was all becoming a bit clearer how this had happened. The hovering smoke. The acrid fumes. The familiar smell. Black powder. "Where the hell did the powder come from?" He yelled.

Elbert's eyes widened with the dawning of understanding.

Bergmann intervened. "Not now, dammit! The boy!"

Three hours later, a pale, unconscious Blaze was being gently lifted from the rubble. Ole Bess was poised to lift the lad, Ralph, and Bergmann to the top. The doctor was waiting.

Doc Lanier met the group topside as they exited the lift. "Where do I need to take the lad?"

"My house." Both men chimed in unison.

"No. My place is closer." Dirk decided. "Likely you'll be out of a bed yourself if Blaze is recovering in yours, and I'm going to need you at your best, Ralph."

Ralph attempted to protest but could barely keep up as they loaded Blaze into the back of the physician's small cart and sped away. "Oh Lord" was all he managed to say as they disappeared into the distance.

"Mrs. Arp! Ready a room! We have an injured worker!" Dirk bellowed to the housekeeper as he literally kicked the screen door open.

Mrs. Arp hurried ahead, hastily prepping the yellow guest room. Dirk placed the boy gently in the center of the large feather bed, feeling the lad's slight weight then the burden of blame. It was miracle that old Doc Lanier was there checking a burn on Mrs. Arp's arm. His timing couldn't have been better.

"How bad is it, doc?" Dirk positioned the patient with caution.

"I won't know until I examine him. Help me get him unclothed and we will check for breaks. And head injuries. If there are head injuries, it could be bad. Really bad." The ancient physician mumbled as he worked.

Dirk had already begun cutting at Blaze's trousers, beginning at the pant legs and working his way up gently not to disturb any potentially broken bones. He moved with painstaking ease, carefully assessing each slender limb but leaving his underthings intact. As he removed the worn material of the grimy shirt, he encountered a thick swath of material bound around the boy's chest. The puzzled look on his face turned to one of disbelief as he cut it away and two perfectly formed breasts sprang free. The knife jerked upward and he cut his own hand.

"Oh my..." Doc looked closely at the patient as a dawning of recognition came over him. "This be Ann Ward, also known as Blaze. Lord help her! What was she thinking?"

"I don't know, but I intend to get to the bottom of this as soon as you make sure she is okay." Bergmann promised.

"I'll be explaining it later, boss. Later. First the lass." A weary Ralph appeared in the doorway, his face etched with worry.

*****

Ann woke in slow stages, unsure why she had a loud ringing in her ears, a terrible headache, and heavy hands. Slowly she lifted her right hand and tried to focus on whatever was covering it. Her eyesight was blurry and just beyond the hand she held up; she saw a slumped figure in a chair next to her bed. She must have made a sound as the shadow jumped awake and rubbed its face. Straining her vision, she could barely make out the stubbled jawline of Bergmann in the waning light. She startled again. What had happened? How did she get here? What time was it?

"Shhhh lass. You're fine. Rest Blaze. Rest." The words were a quiet reassurance from Bergmann which only succeeded in confusing her more.

"Water." She uttered brokenly between cracked lips.

Bergmann jumped awake and immediately poured liquid into a glass. He gently held it to her lips as she drank eagerly.

Slow down. Just take sips. You'll upset your stomach by gulping it after not eating for so long.

"So long?" She managed to whisper.

"You've been unconscious for three days now and the Doc said it's been touch and go. You've had a lot of people worried." He cleared his own dry throat. "And when you are up to it, we are going to have a discussion about this." A frown marred his handsome face.

She shut her eyes in shame. Her ruse had been discovered. Now how was she going to support herself? Pay her bills? Pay off the loan against Mama's tub? She had been so close... "I do what I have to do to survive."

"Mining?" The word was uttered more harshly than he had intended as he had not realized how the situation had affected him until he watched her for three days in that bed, pale and unresponsive. He had tended her himself. He had dripped sugar water in her mouth, past those pale yet alluring lips. He had wiped the smooth perfect brow, assisted the physician in the assessment of those perfect limbs. What had she been thinking?

"I had to do what I had to do. I am a survivor." She turned her head away at his obvious disapproval.

"Oh no you don't." He gently turned her to face him again. "Blaze Ann, you have almost scared the life out of me, and I told you when you woke up, you owed me this."

He bent over her and his lips captured hers gently as his hand pulled her in closer. His hand strayed with familiarity to the tips of her hair and softly rubbed her neck. She gasped inwardly as his tongue invaded her mouth, chasing hers with purpose. Her heart began beating rapidly, sounding deafening to her own ears. Blaze's mind was numb. She had never been kissed quite like this.

Abruptly he pulled away with labored breathing. "I'm sorry. You've just had everyone so worried. How do you feel? Are you in pain? Does your head hurt? Your hands? Legs? Tell me."

"I feel... odd. What's wrong with my hands?"

"You don't remember the blast?" He continued to rub her neck with care.

Blaze shut her eyes with a sharp intake of breath. "You said it would not blast until I was behind the safe wall."

"Technically, that is how it should have happened but Elbert, with his lack of faith in new ideas, loaded the charge with black powder. When you shoved it in the hole, it must have sparked against a rock and exploded prematurely. The only thing that saved your head was the hard hat you wore underneath your hat. Thank God you are hard headed too... to choose to listen to someone else's ideas and carry through. God, Blaze Ann, you have scared the life out of me. Why? Why didn't you come to me and explain? I would have helped you, given you a position in my household...

"Never." Her eyes turned hard. "I will never be any man's mistress. I can support myself in an honest manner. I have been educated as any fine lady yet I am as strong as an ox and make a pretty darn good miner."

"Mistress?" Dirk's shocked reply echoed awkwardly. "You think I am that type of man?"

"What am I to think?" A tear slipped down her cheek.

Noting her distress, he began to shush her. "Hush. You have just come to. Now is not the time for this. I assure you, Blaze Ann, you are worth much more than being some man's mistress. I would never ask such a thing. I consider myself a gentleman."

"Not every man is a gentleman." She replied curtly before closing her eyes to avoid further conversation. "I would like to rest now."

Not wanting to upset her further, Dirk changed the subject. "I'm going to get you some chicken broth. I need to send for Ralph. Poor man has been on pins and needles. And there is someone here who has been very anxious to see you."

"Who?" Her eyes popped open in curiosity and... fear.

Dirk eased the room door open. Tiger sauntered in and jumped onto Ann's chest, managing to nuzzle to her nose before settling in beside her. "He has been yowling constantly since your accident."

Uttering a relieved giggle, she cuddled her feline friend closer to her. A shudder of apprehension rippled through her body. What if Keith Roberts really insisted on claiming his winnings from their agreement? She had been so naive and foolish. This accident had caused her forfeit as she had missed this week's payment by being unconscious. She was late on a payment, and she now owed Roberts the additional collateral. She shivered again.

"Are you chilled?"

"No." She smiled sweetly to him. He could not know. He would think she was an immoral person. Ralph could not know. He would kill her! She had made this mess; she would have to be the one to live with the consequences.

"I'll be right back with broth." Dirk eased from the room, pausing for a moment at the door to examine the pale young woman in the bed. He had learned much from her delirious ramblings over the past few days, and he wanted to know more about her. She was troubled by something. That something seemed to involve the town moneylender. Whatever the conditions of the loan, they troubled her, even in her subconscious state. He vowed to find out what he could.

*****

The door to her room burst open as Ralph bounded in, scooping her gently into his arms. "Blaze Ann, Oh God, Blaze Ann. I thought I had lost you. Thank God you're okay."

I'm fine, Ralph. Dock Lanier just left and told me that I'm a living miracle."

"Child, you caused me a dozen more gray hairs, I swear. Now you just stay in this bed and recover."

"When can I go home, Ralph?"

"Child, your hands are badly burned. You aren't going to be able to do anything for yourself for quite a while. There's no way you can go home and take care of yourself. We can't let those burns get infected. Bergmann here can provide the care you need. You'll be staying here a while."

"I can't Ralph. I can't" She protested.

"Blaze Ann, ye have to. No choice. I know you're hard-headed and stubborn, but for your own good, you're going to have to do what's best, not what Blaze wants. I'm putting my foot down for your own good."

"But I missed a payment on my loan. I was so close... Roberts and I had an agreement with additional terms and...."

"Hush. I'll take care of that low down scoundrel. Don't you worry about that."

"No Ralph, you don't understand..."

"Blaze Ann, stop worrying. You ain't gonna lose your Mama's tub. I won't let ya. I put my foot down here. You are a woman grown with wild head strong ways, but this time I'm taking care of you as I promised your Pa. You are like my own daughter, you understand? I even made sure that mangy cat of yours was here in case.. and I do mean in case you came to. Blaze Ann, you just don't realize how close you came to dying. I'm not taking any more chances. Now looky here at the scratches I earned bringing that cat to you." He displayed the angry red trio of marks of his arms. "He caterwauled all the way here. If I can handle him, I can handle Roberts."

Smiling through her tears, she never realized that was the last time she would see Ralph Williams alive.

*****

Okay, let's start at the top again." The sheriff questioned Ann for what felt like the hundredth time. "You borrowed money from Keith Roberts as a business arrangement. You Ma's brass tub was the collateral for the loan. You had an accident, missed a payment, and Mr. Roberts rightfully took possession of the item for collateral." The law officer shook his head. He had no doubt the terms of the loan had been less than reputable, but when dealing with someone like Roberts you just had to turn your head the other way quite often. Roberts was the type of man who craved power, had enough money to prey on the less fortunate, and still manage to turn the tables to where the situation benefitted only him. Heck, Sheriff Johnson was in debt to the lender himself and if he crossed paths with him, well, he didn't want to think about that possibility. It was too bad this young lady had developed the misfortune taking out a loan with the man. The consequences could not be good for her but around here; it's every man for himself. Times were hard and no one was going to cross Roberts. Sheriff Johnson hated himself for what he was about to say because he had known Ann and her Father for a long time, but the situation was out of his control. He had his own family to worry about. "Well Miss Ward, I've already talked with Mr. Roberts and he showed me the contract bearing both your signatures. I suggest you quietly honor the terms and conditions you two agreed upon and just pay up. You know how it works around here, and if I go bending the law for one person, everyone will expect the same favor. That's not fair to Mr. Roberts either. He has the good faith enough to loan people around here some money during hard times, and he can't be expected to not collect his dues, now can he? One good man has already lost his life over this situation. I suggest you just pay up and keep quiet about it. It's what you agreed to with him. You should've never signed your life away if you couldn't pay the loan."

Her face flooded with crimson just knowing Sheriff Johnson had read that contract. "But I just missed one payment because of the accident. I've been knocked out, and Ralph..."

"Miss Ward, it seems Mr. Williams stormed wrongfully into Mr. Roberts' home and place of business making threats. A fight broke out. According to Mr. Roberts, Williams initiated the violence and he was just protecting himself. All I have here is a signed contract and Roberts' word against a dead man's actions. That contract is legally binding in this town. That's it."

Dirk's heart broke as Blaze Ann emitted a quiet sob. There was more here at stake than a brass tub he was willing to bet, and he was going to get to the bottom of it.

*****

Ann was devastated. She had truly lost everyone now. Her foolish quest to keep Mama's tub had cost her the last of anyone she considered family, and now she was going to have to become Keith Robert's mistress. A quiet cry broke forth as she shuddered in disgust. That was the terms of the loan. One missed payment, even by one day, and she would be his mistress until he tired of her. She had been so sure of her ability to pay back the loan, she never considered this. Her life was ruined. And for what? An object. A stupid object. Over and over she asked herself why as she rocked silently in the bed. Her hands were still bandaged but she didn't care if they healed or not. Her life felt like it was over. She stopped eating. She stopped talking with Bergmann. He didn't need to know her shame. He would probably demand the same from her for his kindness and care. Another wave of crying overtook her as she tried to withdraw into herself.

Dirk stood outside the door, listening to Blaze Ann's agony. He truly wished she would confide in him. Trust him. Care for him. He knew there was more riding at stake on this loan, and he had to find out. Leaving instructions with Mrs. Arp, he saddled his horse and bolted into the direction of Roberts' home.

A flustered Mrs. Arp brought a tray of food into Ann's room, her normally composed manner in a shambles. Of course, Ann had heard the angry orders Bergmann had barked out to his housekeeper and cook. Not wanting to upset the sweet woman further, she accepted the soup she was being fed without further fight. Apprehension began to creep in when she realized that this was the first time Bergmann had not fed her since the accident. It was obvious that he too was angry with her. As she swallowed spoonful after spoonful of the delicious vegetable fare, she spun a plan into action.

"I am so sleepy after that nice warm soup." She yawned convincingly to Mrs. Arp.

"Oh honey, you snuggle in here and take a nice nap. Mr. Bergmann will be back soon and he'll be looking in on you. I swear, I think he's sweet on you, I do. He has let no one until now to look after you. Never left your side when Doc Lanier bandaged you up and was a complete bear until you came to."

"But he seemed... angry." She braved the observation.

"Oh honey, that doesn't have anything to do with you, sweetie. He just has some urgent business to take care of. It happens from time to time, although he is usually the even tempered type."

That was it. She knew what she needed to do. She could never live with herself if he found out she had sold herself like a common prostitute. She could not bear his disappointment. Or did he already know? A knot of fear twisted her innards as she feigned sleep until the kindly woman left the room.

Sweat beaded on her brow as the bulky bandages were removed and grimaced as she examined the raw patches of skin on her hands. The thin mining gloves had offered little protection and her hands, when healed, were sure to be grotesquely scarred. Little did it matter now. She had failed her father, mother, Ralph, Bergmann, and herself. She had survived to live another day on this earth, but had somehow landed in the pits of Hell, regardless. It took her three times as long to pull on her serviceable day dress with the patched elbows, and she gently pulled an equally worn bonnet over her hair. Thank goodness her shoes slipped onto her feet. Fleetingly, she wondered why all her personal belongings were at Bergmann's, but didn't stop to question her good fortune. At least she would not have to travel back to her cabin to retrieve them later.

Her hands screamed in pain as the very air that touched them seemed to set them afire. Her head was pounding, she was dizzy and nauseous, but she had to press on. Quietly she slipped out the back door and walked toward town, completely overestimating her strength.

Waves of nausea spurred her on as she neared town. It seemed to be a normal day in the Copper Basin with the usual people bustling about their business, until she noticed the ladies from the church looking her way pointing. It was obvious they were surprised and to see her. She mistook their interest as concern until Mrs. Finch and little Polly cut a wide berth around her, directly cutting her.

"Well hello, Polly. How are you today?" Ann called out, trying to catch their attention.

The angelic little girl she had watched grow up turned back and smiled. "I'm really happy to see you Miss Ann, but Mama says I can't come see you and Tiger anymore because you are a scarlet woman. Mama, what's a scarlet woman?" The child asked innocently before being dragged away. "Miss Ann doesn't look scarlet to me. She looks normal."

Her throat constricted as she realized that no one was truly concerned for her welfare, that she had just become yet another casualty of the town's biased mode of thinking. How could they? She had been born and raised here, yet they scorned her as if she were a common prostitute. Her newfound awareness of the situation amplified their titters and verbal slights. All around her she heard snippets of conversations containing the words gold digger, ill repute, and trollop. How could they? Although she had known this town had a closed minded attitude, she somehow didn't think they would turn so quickly on one of their own. She ran as quickly to the one place she knew she could escape - Home.

*****

The ashes were still shouldering in the place where her cabin had once stood. It was gone. Nothing was left standing. Nothing. Everything was gone. Tears flowed down her dusty face as she collapsed into the dirt, her energy spent, her wounds burning from the red clay grit. Now what should she do? Where should she go? The townspeople had shunned her, Ralph was dead, her house was gone, her hands were burned, Roberts was surely out to collect his due, and Bergmann was likely next in line to demand payment. She felt totally numb and didn't hear the hoof beats nearing her. Gentle hands scooped her up from the ground and cradled her head into a firm shoulder.

"Shhh. It's okay. We saved all your things. You are safe." Dirk held her tightly, wishing she hadn't discovered the destruction until he had broken the news to her. She had suffered enough at the hands of these people. His heart almost exploded as he mentally concocted a plan. A very good plan, as he was sure he could fall in love with this copper haired minx. "Shhh. Careful with your hands. We need to get you home and get them bathed and dressed. You don't want them to become infected, Blaze Ann. You scared the life out of me when I came home and you were gone. I realized then I could not live without you."

Her heart stopped. Could he possibly care for her as she did for him? She startled even herself with that admission. She was falling for Dirk Bergmann and hadn't even realized it. Her shoulders shook in a racking sob and he held her closer. She could not allow herself the luxury of love. It just wasn't in her future.

After they arrived back at his home, Mrs. Arp cut her a disapproving look as she cleaned and tended her hands in the sunny kitchen. The freshly burned skin had not been ready for such abuse and even though the ministrations were tender, they were very painful.

"I...I'm sorry. I thought I needed to leave because I am a hindrance to you and Mr. Bergmann, then when I went to town, Mrs. Finch called me... called me..." A broken breath halted her sentence.

"Now don't you worry about those snooty people. I've heard what they have been saying. They don't have a clue. They'd better not throw stones because we all live in glass houses. Hush now. The most important thing is for you to heal. Mr. Bergmann has been worried out of his mind about you, Miss Ward. You just would not believe what..."

"How are you?" Dirk entered just in time to break off the conversation before Mrs. Arp revealed too much.

"I'm feeling much better, thank you. I'm afraid I have set myself back quite a bit by removing those bandages."

"As long as we keep the wounds clean, I think it will be fine, but you are going to need someone to take care of you." A teasing glint sparked his eye. "And I've volunteered for the job. Permanently." He dropped to one knee. "Blaze Ann Marie Ward, would you do me the honor of becoming my wife?"

"Whaaaa?" She could not believe her ears. "Wife? Are you sure?"

"I have never been so sure of something in all my life. From the moment I saw you in that bed when you were injured, it all made sense.

"I don't want your pity." She stated plainly.

"I do not pity you." He countered. "I admire you. I applaud you. I adore you." He continued. "Please, be my wife." In one hand he held a gold ring with a large square cut emerald in the center. "Blaze Ann..." His version of her name was like a prayer on his lips.

"But how can you be sure? What made you...? This is a big decision..."

"I have never been so sure of anything in my life. We have much in common and it will be a good union."

It was not what she hoped for, but she supposed it would have to be enough. With an open mind and hope for the future, she replied. "Yes. Yes I'll marry you."

A wave of relief spread over his face. Lacing the ring on a soft creamy white ribbon, he placed it around her wrist. "I will be happy when the day comes that you can wear it." His words were whispered tenderly in her ear.

Mrs. Arp had a tear of happiness in her eye. "When can we expect the happy day to arrive?"

"Tonight." Dirk replied calmly. "I was hoping I wasn't over confident, but I already have everything arranged." He turned back to Ann. "Can you be ready by eight?"

Startled, she sputtered any excuse that came to mind. "I don't have anything to wear..."

"I have already taken care of that, my dear."

In a daze, Ann walked back to her room. It had all happened so quickly. What was his motive? Why was he willing to marry her? She owned nothing of value. She was worthless, and even more so in the eyes of the township. Her worries were stopped cold as she spied the dress spread across the bed.

"Oh Lordy, Miss Ward, he must love you very much already." Mrs. Arp exclaimed as she ran her hand over the pale cream colored silk. Matching lace trimmed slippers peeped out from under the hem of it as it was draped over the side of the bed, and the finely sheer veil placed to the side was of the softest weave.

"Love me?" Ann's puzzlement was obvious.

"Love you. No question about it. I've been around that man since he was in knickers and I've never seen him give a woman a second glance. When he first saw you in that bed all weak and pale after the accident, his whole demeanor changed. It was like he found himself by finding you. I just can't explain it. Love at first sight. That's it. Love at first sight. You will have some story to tell your children."

At the mention of children, Ann felt herself go numb. She was going to have to submit to the marriage act. But at least she would be married instead of a mistress. It was a small measure of comfort, but still didn't calm her apprehension.

*****

Ann didn't recognize her own reflection in the mirror. The pale elegant lady stared back apprehensively as Mrs. Arp's daughter artfully styled her short copper tresses. Thankfully the girl was quietly efficient, leaving Ann to her own thoughts.

The preparation had begun with a lavender scented bath. She had been washed, pampered and dressed in the softest of shifts. The finely woven material felt deliciously smooth against her goose-fleshed skin. Next the cream silk gown was lifted over her head. Her future husband must have an impeccable eye for detail she inwardly marveled as the gown fit perfectly. The slightest excuse of a bustle was placed in the behind to hold up the cascading train, and a wide matching bow completed the back accents.

Ann looked down at her bandaged hands. The wide cut sleeves of the dress fell over the wrappings, camouflaging her injuries. Both the scoop neckline and sleeves were trimmed with crochet teardrop lace. She had never worn anything this fine and felt every inch a princess.

Her hair fell simply to her shoulders in its natural inclination to wave softly around her cheekbones and her eyes glowed brightly on her face with unshed tears. Mrs. Arp's daughter lightly pinched her cheeks to add color then produced a dainty vial of real perfume. As the ornate glass stopper was removed, a wafting of lavender filled the air. Ann's senses reeled in delight as the scent was applied to the pulse points of her neck, behind her ears, and the soft spot on her neck just above her collarbones. She gasped when she felt a coolness sliding around her neck and a large, square emerald pendant rested exactly in the same area.

"Mr. Bergmann intends for me to wear jewels also?" She spoke breathlessly.

"He sent them as a wedding present to his bride with his regards, miss." The young lady replied. "And can I suggest to ya not to call him Mr. Bergmann tonight? He is to be ya husband soon an' a fine one he'll be. I've known him since I was knee high to a jack rabbit. A good man he is, Miss. A good man." She picked up a length of lacy material. "Can you stand now, Miss? We need to place the veil."

Ann felt her chest swell with another large intake of air as yards of superbly laced material balanced into place on her head. A crochet circlet held it into place and Mrs. Arp's daughter went immediately to work as she spread it out in the back. It was like a sheer cloud enveloping her entire backside then trailing several feet behind her.

"It's too much." Ann hadn't realized she had spoken aloud until the young woman replied to her musing.

"Oh no, Miss. You're a beautiful bride. Mr. Dirk will be swept off his feet this evening. Why, he's even having a wedding portrait made this very eve. The photographer is already downstairs; he is all set up and ready to go. I wish me and Oscar could have had a wedding portrait done but..." She trailed off. "Flabbergash. 'Nuff about me. Today is your day. You're beautiful. I wish you many happy days ahead." The shy girl caught a movement from the corner of her eye then discreetly excused herself from the room.

Ann looked up to speak again and was met with Dirk's smoldering gaze. "Beautiful." He uttered under his breath.

"Isn't it bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding ceremony?" Her heart skipped more than one beat as she assessed his stare.

"That is but an ancient superstition borne from arranged marriages. It was conjured by fretful fathers-of-the-bride when the marriageable lady was unattractive. Rumor has it that many a groom would renege on the union when presented with an unsightly woman. Thus, enterprising fathers created the belief of bad luck, so to say, to keep the bride's appearance a mystery until that moment when the ceremony was well underway. I imagine there has been many a man throughout time taken aback in horror when the veil was lifted for him to kiss his bride." He chuckled. "But if you notice, you do not have any type of lace covering your face to hinder this."

The kiss began softly as his hands cupped her face. Within seconds, she felt the tingle of lightening down her spine as his lips slashed hungrily over hers. His tongue invaded the pliable softness of her mouth and her head felt dizzy.

"Bergmann!" Her voice was raspy even to her own ears.

"Dirk." His mouth was next to her ear and she shivered as he spoke. "That is Dirk. Or Husband. Or any other endearment you wish."

She blushed furiously as she eased out of his embrace. The clock in the hallway chimed the quarter hour. "I must finish getting ready." She regulated her breathing and composed her thoughts.

"Before you go, let me help you with this." He produced a large magnola flower with emerald green streaming ribbons. "It attaches to your wrist so you won't have to hold your bridal bouquet."

"Oh Dirk, you have thought of everything." She was amazed at his resourcefulness and thankful that her bandaged hands would not marr the expensive wedding portrait.

"I have tried to, Blaze Ann. It's not everyday that a woman gets married."

"I never felt I would get married at all." She looked downward in doubt. "Are you sure this is what you want to do?"

"Are you sure Blaze Ann?" His blue eyes determinedly met her gaze as he lifted her chin with his hand.

"I hope I don't disappoint." She chewed her lower lip and gazed at her hands. "My hands will be scarred for life."

"Blaze Ann, you are perfect as you are. You could never disappoint. As you said, you are a survivor. I enjoy your company. I admire your approach to life. I feel we'll be very compatible."

She smiled sadly at him, wishing for more than compatible, but she was in no position to pursue girlish dreams of her youth. "Yes, I think we will be compatible."

"The Reverend is already here as is the photographer. I have commissioned a wedding portrait to be done. I want this day to be fondly remembered." He brushed his lips over her cheek then left.

Mrs. Arp's daughter reappeared and helped Ann begin her descent down the winding staircase. Ann had a pain in her heart as neither Papa nor Ralph was here to escort her to her groom. Blinking back the tears, she could only hope they were smiling down from above.

Mrs. Arp was softly playing the small piano in the corner of the large study. Candles illuminated the room, bathing the deep blue wallpaper in a golden haze. The summery smell of magnolia filled the air as the blooms were floating in clear glass bowls filled with water around the room. Bergmann, no Dirk was already in place, dashingly handsome in his all black formal wear. Reverend Brown held his worn bible in his hands, smiling at the young couple. A few of her co-workers were in attendance, dressed in their Sunday best. She barely suppressed a smile when she spied Tiger stretched lazily on the brocade settee wearing a green ribbon around his neck. Yes, her future husband had thought of everything!

Her heart began to thud in an erratic beat when Reverend Brown began, "We have gathered together here today..."

The ceremony was over quickly and Reverend Brown pronounced them Man and Wife. For the second time that evening Ann felt Dirk's lips take possession of hers. She shivered slightly as she tried to block the coming night from her mind. At least she was a wife and not a mistress. That was some measure of security to her jumbled train of thought, but doubt still niggled at her sense of reasoning. Why had Bergmann offered for her?

Her husband was soon at her side and Mrs. Arp started playing a slow song on the piano. Raising her arms around his neck, the bride and groom circled the room in sweeping movements. Her co-workers clapped happily in time for the music. She gave each and every one of her loyal friends a smile as she moved by them and they nodded their approval. Not every miner in her crew was there, but the ones who mattered were present for support. They would never understand how much it meant to her as they were the only family she had left.

Dirk tightened his grip around his bride's small waist. He felt very proud that this flame haired woman was his. A wave of possessiveness washed over him as he felt a new responsibility to care for her. "Do you like your necklace and ring?" He asked. "I know they are not in the latest fashion of diamond jewelry, but they seemed to suit you."

"They are beautiful. They are more than I ever imagined." She preferred the green stone to a diamond.

"I mined them myself."

Her eyes widened in surprise. "You dug these huge stones out of the earth?"

"Yes. Mr. Raht made sure I was educated in every form of mining before sending me here. These stones are special because they were mined in Raht's homeland of Germany. They were among my first real finds. I had them cut into a matching set, mounted in jewelry, and put them away for my future wife. As I grew up in the care of the Rahts and without any true parents, I knew I didn't have my mother's ring to pass to my wife."

"They are perfect." The couple broke apart then began to converse with their guests. Everyone in attendance gathered around when the photographer began setting up his equipment, arranging the candles, and posing his subjects. Having a tintype portrait made was a novelty in the area as none could afford the luxury and the process was an amusing diversion for the guests. Once the bride and groom were posed to the photographer's satisfaction, they were required to hold their pose for several minutes for the image to take onto the thin iron plate. As everyone collectively held their breath, the photographer announced the final product was finished. After he slid the portrait into a lacy paper sleeve, everyone gathered around to admire the somber looking couple.

Ann was the first to comment. "I appear to have been sucking on a lemon, husband. I wonder if our ancestors will feel we are a most unhappy couple?"

"Nonsense. You look every inch a beautiful bride. The groom wears a telling smirk, if you look closely.." Indeed he had maintained a hint of a smile during the entire process. "Our future relatives will know we were most happy couple." He honestly hoped this would be the case.

"And why does my groom wear such an expression in our wedding portrait?" She smiled brilliantly at her husband.

"He was imagining his wife in breeches." Dirk answered honestly as it was a vision that had haunted him ever since he learned Blaze's true gender. "I will insist you wear them for me again someday."

"Husband!" She swatted his arm as she admired their portrait.

I think we are a splendid couple, although I do imagine that one day a portrait will be produced in the blink of an eye and will be capable of capturing the spontaneaity of the moment." He mused.

Ann realized then her husband was a forward thinker. No wonder he was treated as a foreign specimen in the Copper Basin.

As the clock struck the eleventh hour, Dirk felt his new wife begin to falter by his side. He felt a twinge of guilt for hastening the wedding, but he knew if he hadn't made her his wife, Roberts would be insisting she fufill the terms of the loan agreement. He would never allow that low life scum to touch Blaze Ann. He caressed her elbow. "Are you ready to retire?"

Her eyes flickered with what appeared to be apprehension as she nodded.

The crowd cheered and prepared for their departures as the couple excused themselves. Ann noted that Dirk took her past her usual room and opened the door to the spacious burgundy room on the right. A massive four poster bed occupied most of the floor space and she immediately noted her toiletries had been moved to the dressing table in the corner. He kissed her cheek briefly before whispering that he would return soon.

Mrs. Arp's daughter reappeared again to assist Ann in her evening preparations. Her wedding dress was removed and her hair was brushed. She was freshened with damp cloth, the lavender perfume was reapplied, and then she was dressed in the sheerest peach nightgown she had ever seen. Crossing her arms over her chest, she was mortified to feel so exposed.

"Is there a wrapper to go with this gown?" She self consciously questioned.

"Yes Mrs. Bergmann. Here." The young girl drew a matching sheer jacket over her shoulders.

Ann surveyed her reflection in the mirror, noting that the wrap provided very little coverage.

"Good night, Mrs. Bergmann." The girl prepared to exit.

Ann almost stopped her but knew she would just be delaying the inevitable. She moved to the center of the large bed and waited. Feeling uncharactistically chilled, she occupied her mind by studying the paintings on the wall. They were scenes from various lands she had never visited. The artist was very good, and she almost felt she could lose herself in the depths of the scenerey. She was drawn to one in particular of a vast, endless body of water with a shoreline of the palest beige. The trees were oddly shaped with no branches but rather spiky froths of leaves growing out of the tops of them. The water was depicted in a myriad of blues with white capped waves. Cocking her head sideways, she only knew such waves to exist in stormy weather, but in the painting, the weather was sunny and bright. Thinking back to her long dismissed education, she deducted that this must be the ocean and feverntly wished to visit it some day.

Just then the door eased open. Her husband filled the opening and was carrying a tray. "I have brought us something to eat as I know you must be famished."

It was true. She had not been able to eat much that evening due to her nerves. The smell of blackberries caused her mouth to water and he placed a small piece of pie on a plate before her. Without thinking, she reached for her fork.

"Oh no." He smiled wickely. "That is now my job." He lifted the fork as she dropped her bandaged hands to her sides. Carefully he cut a bite sized piece of pie then presented it to her.

"I am mortified, husband." Her cheeks burned with color.

"Nonsense. This is my pleasure."

Patiently he shared the pie with her bite for bite until the last piece was gone. Placing the dishes aside, he reached for another bowl on the tray and unfolded a soft white cloth.

"Now we will tend your hands." He gently unbandaged them and inspected their progress. "The burns are healing nicely and your nails are all intact. There will be some scarring, but doesn't appear that it will hinder your joint movement. The herbal concoction I am about to apply will not only help the scarring, but should make them feel better." He gently kissed her cheek. "I know you are in pain, Blaze Ann, yet you never utter one complaint." He marveled at his wife's courage.

The herbal gel did feel good to her burns and she breathed a sigh of relief. "It smells nice too. What is it?"

"Do you see that pointy green plant growing from the ground in the seaside painting?" He nodded to the canvas she had been admiring earlier. "It is called Aloe and has many healing properties."

"How do you know this?" She marveled at his knowledge.

"I spent some time with in Florida during my travels. I tried to paint as many pictures as I could along the way so I would never forget the marvels I have seen."

"You painted all these?" She again found herself amazed.

"Yes. They are modestly done. I am not an artist by any stretch of the imagination, but I treasure them as mementos of my memories." He looked at all his work hanging on the walls. "Mr. Raht has given me many opportunities. I am indebted to him for life." He then produced a pair of loose cotton gloves. "Let's try this tonight, Blaze. You might feel more comfortable." He slid the soft cool coverings onto her hands, carefully adjusting each finger. "These may feel more normal but I do ask that you don't try to bend your fingers too much just yet."

"How do you know so much about burns?"

"As I said before, I spent a lot of time with generous people who shared their knowledge. Unfortunately in mining, there are always accidents. Burns, broken bones and lung conditions are all too prevalent. I have noted the safety precautions taken by others throughout the country and I'm trying to compile a list of the best. That's where the hard hat idea came from, and luckily you heeded that suggestion." With his ministrations complete, he set the tray aside. His eyes began to burn with desire.

Momentarily forgetting her state of dress, or undress as she felt, she shivered involuntarily as he kissed her again. Her head began to spin and her spine tingled.

"Blaze Ann, do you understand what is to happen tonight?" He breathed into her ear.

She shook her head side to side, lamenting the lack of womanly influence in her life.

"Do not be afraid." He reassured her. "I will tend you as gently as I have your hands. Let me teach you."

She gave an apprehensive nod. Did she really have a choice?

*****

Ann woke in slow stages, realizing she was no longer in the cheerful yellow guest room at Bergmann's home. She turned her head to the side then saw the small wedding portrait propped up on the bedside table. Wincing at the ever present pain in her hands, she stretched slowly, exploring the feelings of a woman. She was a girl no more. Bergmann, no Dirk, had been everything he had promised and more. A languid expression crossed her face as she recalled the previous night's events. Her husband chanced to enter the room just as that emotion was visible on her countenance.

Dirk watched his wife awaken then brighten the room with the smile of a woman. He let loose a sigh of relief as he pushed a large tub into the room. "I thought you might like a bath this morning, Blaze Ann."

Her eyes widened in complete surprise as she recognized the brass tub immediately. "Oh Dirk!" Tears of happiness streamed down her face. Her husband had truly thought of everything. Her world felt complete as Tiger sauntered into the room, dragging the remains of a green ribbon for a toy.

"How? When? Oh, thank you, Dirk. This means everything to me." His name came easily from her mouth and he liked the way it sounded. Her heart was overruling her brain. There was no possible way this man could love her, and she focused on reason and fact. Reflecting on her husband's appearance as she realized he had already bathed. His face was freshly shaven and his still damp hair clung slighly to his face. His buff pants hugged muscular legs and the open necked white shirt he wore almost gave him the appearance of pirates she had studied about long ago. He returned her warm greeting with a kiss.

"I will have this filled with warm water shortly, my dear. I trust you are feeling well this morning?" Dirk drank in the sight before him, knowing he had fallen hopelessly in love with the copper haired minx.

"I haven't felt this good in a long time, husband." Now that she knew the secrets of the universe, she was immensely glad she hadn't been forced into honoring Robert's contract. As Bergmann felt he owed J.E. Raht, she was indebted to Dirk Bergmann for a lifetime. She knew if Keith Roberts had successfully fulfilled the terms of the contract, she would have most likely lost her sanity; it would have been more than she could bear. It was something that was intimate. Sacred. Shared. Bergmann may not love her, but she vowed to be a good wife to him. Perhaps one day he might have feelings for her. She knew she was already nurturing them for him. Perhaps one day he would tell her how he disolved the contract, but she wasn't quite ready to own up to her shame by mentioning it.

"Good." He positioned it into the corner of the room. "I'll be your lady's maid this morning." His leering smile made her blush then laughed lustfully as he knew their appearance downstairs would be somewhat delayed.

With the morning preparations complete, the newly wedded couple finally emerged, ready for a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon, and tall fluffy biscuits. Meg felt positively pampered by the fare, served on delicate china. It was a far cry from eating flat biscuits and gravy on a tin tray. The rest of the day passed in a dreamy blur as the bride and groom began to get to know each other.

Their days passed easily; their nights were filled with passion and discovery. Ann watched her hands slowly heal under Dirk's persistant care. She even enjoyed the scent of the coconut oil and butter mixture he began using to help moisturize and to loosen the tightess in her skin. His persistance was paying off and although scarring was present, it was minimal. She was pleased to regain the use of her fingers just in time for the harvest. She knew Mrs. Arp could use some help in the kitchen.

As autumn approached, the daylight hours shortened and a definite briskness replaced the heat of summer. Although her husband had returned to work in the mines, she never felt lonely or bored as he had a large library. Her favorite book thus far was a diary of sorts, an accounting of a life written in a masculine hand. Ann wondered if it would embarrass Dirk if he knew she had found his travel ledger. His detailed accounting of his adventures brought the events to life and she suddenly understood why he was such a forward thinker. It was a big world, and the people of the Copper Basin had only sampled a minute taste of life in their isolated area. Her opinion of foreign people and change began to turn and her attitude toward progress began to alter.

If only the old timers could see her husband in this light, to realize that their way wasn't the only way, that their people were not the only people, and that new ideas could truly be worthwhile. Ol' Bess was a prime example of Dirk Bergmann's determination. A steam whim had been installed at the Mary Mine as he had promised, and the old mule now happily grazed in a cultivated patch of grass on their land. The failed blast had been attempted again and this time it was successful, making the mine a largely profitable and earning the miners a raise. Safety equipment was now mandatory, and all black powder had been removed from the work area. Yet, the mindset of the people of the area was difficult to change and the improvments were shunned by most. Ann still wasn't immune to the icy stares she received in church, and this hurt her deeply. Some of her old friends remained true; others formed a low opinion of her and avoided her. Allowing her finger to trace the words on the page she was reading, she supposed it was much the same everywhere, and despite public opinion, she would not trade her circumstances to return to her old way of life. Deep in her heart she knew both Papa and Ralph would be proud of her. Papa would have liked Bergmann with his learned notions. He was destined for great things beyond mining the bowels of the earth.

Winter approached with a fury and the holiday season neared. Ann wished she had coin of her own to purchase Dirk a Christmas gift, but she no longer had her own earnings. In one way this irritated her, but on the other hand, her earnings had been so meager that there was precious little left for luxury. Instead she resorted to her own resourcefulness to knit him a scarf and hat. It had been an easy task to purchase the materials needed from the local mercantile, ignoring the condemning stares cast in her direction. She completed the transaction cheerfully at Marlow's General Store as she obtained the softest of yarns in blue, green, and brown. The colors would go nicely with her husband's coloring. She also purchased a skein in soft yellow. From it she would create the other gift she planned on giving her husband, but it would be much too small for him to wear. A twinkle sparked in her eye when she wondered what he would say when he opened a gift containing a tiny baby gown and booties! At first she hadn't been sure, but after missing her second monthly, she was positive. She hoped he would be pleased, but after all, it was half his fault!

Her transaction was almost complete when she heard a man's voice that sent chills down her spine. "Well, well, well. If it isn't the highest and mightiest piece of womanflesh in the Copper Basin." His words were accented with a sneer. "I've been thinking that that money your husband gave me wasn't a fair shake and I'm just going to claim the terms of that contract."

Ann just looked at him in disbelief. "My husband will not take too kindly to your words, sir."

"Listen to her. Listen to those fancy words. The little Ward slut has gotten a bit above her raisin' on us, boys." His cronies in the background laughed raunchily. "Now Mr. Marlow," Roberts addressed the shop keeper. "If someone comes into your store and takes something, you expect them to pay for it, don't you?"

The shopkeeper eyed the rowdy men warily and nodded his agreement.

"Now you see, Ann Ward, you must pay. The pittance your husband gave me is gone and I want what is due to me." He grabbed her arm, his fingers biting into her skin, and his breath triggered a wave of nausea. It was funny that before marrying Dirk that she considered poor hygeine and broken teeth a normal appearance. Her condition betrayed her composure and she openly gagged.

"Well Miss High and Mighty is sickened at my mere touch." His laugh grew louder and he licked the side of her face. "Ah, you even taste high and mighty now. You cleaned up good for an urchin that dug the earth like most everyone else around here. I'm one of the few full time top siders. You should be honored to be with me."

Ann directed a pleading look at Mr. Marlow, but was met with only apathetic sympathy. It was likely that he was also indebted to Roberts also as was most everyone in the town. "Please tell my husband..." She asked while being dragged from the store.

"Not a word." Keith Roberts shot over his shoulder to the shopkeeper. "Or else."

Mr. Marlow nodded in understanding and fright.

Ann clutched her purchases tightly as the men crowded around her and herded her away from town. Her heart pounded with fear. Surely someone would take notice and alert her husband. Maybe she would see someone she knew and call out to them. She had to keep her wits about her. If she were not in a family way, she would not hesitate to fight, but with the knowledge that life was growing within her compelled her to protect the unborn baby. She tried to pull away from Robert's grasp, but he only tightened his grip. Maybe if she stumbled or fell, she could break free and run. Without a better plan, she began to drag her foot, losing a slipper on the walkway. Roberts almost fell with her, but quickly recovered his balance.

Blaze came alive with a vengeance and began to struggle with all her might. She kicked, bit and clawed but just could not break free of the imprisioning huddle of men around her. It wasn't until she felt a blast of pain to her temple and succumbed to blackness that she stopped. She was oblivious to the off color insults of the men as they remarked to Roberts what fun he was going to experience. She never knew when they rolled her up in a large piece of burlap, slung her over a shoulder, carrying her away. The only evidence of her passing was four skeins of yarn and a single shoe.

Dirk returned home, whistling a lively tune. All felt right in the world until he was greeted by Mrs. Arp at the door, wringing her hands in her apron. "Oh Mr. Bergmann." Her voice broke. "Mrs. Bergmann went to town this morning and hasn't returned. I am so worried."

"She what? When did she leave?" He heart fell. Had she run away? Surely not, as he suspected they were soon to be parents. He had been counting the days and had reached one conclusion. Ann was pregnant. She had not mentioned it to him, but he was unsure if she even realized her condition. What if she had finally figured it out and had run away? Even worse, what if she was seeking to be rid of the baby? His heartbeat hammered loudly in his ears as he headed to the stable. "I'll saddle up and find her. She can't be far."

"Oh I hope not, Mr. Bergmann. I surely hope she is okay. The townsfolk have been less than nice to her since the accident." Mrs. Arp lamented. "Hateful old fools they are. Harrumph. I went to town myself and no one was talking. I began to suspect foul play when I found her things on the sidewalk near Marlow's General Store." She pointed to one shoe and some yarn.

"Are any of her things missing?" He barked to his housekeeper, fearing the worst.

"Oh no, Mr. Bergmann. Oh no, it's not like that. Mrs. Ann didn't run away. I'm sure of that. She was so excited to tell you some news." The yellow yarn found its way into her hand as proof.

"Oh God." Dirk felt an emotion he had never felt before. He was lost. He was heartbroken. He was no longer complete. "She is... expecting?"

"Oh Lordy, Mr. Bergmann. Find her. Please. Find your missus. She loves you, you know. She does."

And I love her too, he thought as he hastily readied his horse, stirring red dust from the earth like a demon possessed.

Mr. Marlow was closing up shop for the day when Dirk rode up to him. "Have you seen my wife?" His question was bluntly direct with a commanding tone.

Marlow's eyes widened in fear.

"Man, have you seen my wife? I have it on good authority that she was in your shop today but she never returned home." With patience wearing thin, he dismounted, grabbed the shopkeeper by the collar and lifted him.

"Can't tell. Retaliation. I owe him." Marlow sputtered as he gasped for breath.

"Who?" Dirk ground out between clenched teeth.

"Owe him money." Marlow choked on his words.

"Roberts." Dirk dropped the cowardly man and steered his horse toward Roberts' house as a cold icy fear enveloped him. Mounting his horse, he rode as if the devil was nipping at his heels. And this devil had a name.

*****

Ann woke in slow stages. Her hands were hurting, their new and tender skin torn and ragged. Where was she? She moaned as she tried to rub the throbbing pain in her head and found herself chained upright to a wall. As she jerked alert in shock, a ribald laugh irritated her aching head.

"Ah, the princess awakens." A gravelly voice erupted. "It's about time you hussy. I'm ready to claim my dues from you, girl. Ya owe me. Ya owe me big and I'm going to have my way with you."

The devilish laughter that continued almost convinced Ann that she had died and gone to hell until she smelled his breath on her neck. His wet repulsive lips claimed hers and she gagged as he tasted of stale whiskey and pipe smoke.

"What's a matter, princess? You tryin' to play hard to get?" More laughter followed his words. "You ain't never gonna get out of here until I tire of you. The contract will be upheld."

Her eyes widened in fear as he held up a piece of paper in front of her, waving it too closely for her to read, but she recognized it regardless. Her careless signature graced the bottom of the page. What was she going to do? Surely Dirk would come after her? Or would he? She gasped again when she thought about the baby. She had never told Dirk. He didn't know they were going to have a baby. What if he decided he no longer wanted her? What would happen to her? Her baby? She drew enough strength to fight back. "My husband will come for me."

"If he can find you. If he cares to find you, that is. Who can say? But if he does get lucky and come this way, I have three guns trained on the entry path and the men holding them have orders to shoot anyone who comes this way." Roberts spewed spittle on her face as he spoke. "He will die trying to reach his precious wife, or will he? He's a rich man, you know. A divorce would not be a hard thing for him to get. He can start new with a woman of breeding, not a guttersnipe who peddles away her body for a bit of coin."

She must think. She had to keep him distracted to stall his plans. "Now Mr. Roberts, you know why I had to borrow money from you. It wasn't for silly things. I had to repay Pa's bills. I am a respectable woman."

"Ha!" His hand wandered down her chin, her neck, then slid into the bodice of her dress. "You ain't going to have a respectable bone in your body when I'm done with you. I will take you places that only the most well-versed doxies have gone."

She fought back the urge to spit in his face as she tested her legs. Surprisingly, they were not chained. A plan began to form in her head as his hand ripped her dress, exposing her creamy breasts. Just as his mouth lowered to them, she raised her foot with all her strength. She did not miss her target.

Roberts screamed in pain as he grabbed his crotch. "You little ...." He struck her hard across the cheek once more.

The rest of his threat faded from her ears as blackness threatened to overtake her again. Oblivion never came and she sputtered as she was doused with a bucket of cold water.

"You will pay for that, my lady. Oh, you will pay. I intend to have my way regardless. It seems to me if you are that much of a wildcat. Bergmann prob'ly has no use for you. Men like their women to be willing."

She could barely catch her breath as the chains were ripped from the wall and she fell to the ground in a heap.

"I intend to claim my stake now." He hauled her roughly up from the cellar, dragging her as each step edge branded her body with a new bruise. She tried to roll into a ball to protect the baby.

By the time they reached the gaudy red and gold bedroom, Ann was a mass of painful scrapes and welts. Considering the filth in Robert's house, she would be lucky if she didn't develop an infection. She tried to envelope her arms around her stomach, but when he threw her into the middle of a large bed her wrists were forcibly tied to the bed posts. As a measure of caution, he also tied her legs to the foot posts. Remembering what Pa had once told her about encountering a wild animal in the woods, she tried not to show any measure of fear.

Pa's words drifted through her aching brain. "Feral creatures feed off of fear, Blaze. If you ever meet up with one, your best chance of survival will be to mask that emotion. Show no fear. Be a strong lass." She could almost hear his voice as if he were standing next to her. She gave an oddly twisted smile. Pa thought he was protecting her from wild animals, not wicked people. Her green eyes shot flames at the madman who circled the bed and she maintained direct contact in silence.

"Not got nothin' to say, do ya?" He licked his lips eagerly and began to remove his breeches. "You will when I get done with you. That's a promise."

Maintaining facial contact, Ann refused to look lower for if she did, her facade of bravery would shatter into a million pieces. Blinking rapidly, she tried to stop the flow of tears sliding down her face. All too soon he was on top of her, his hot breath robbing her of her own. She gagged again in earnest this time and the contents of her stomach found their way all over Robert's face.

He cursed profusely as he wiped the vomit from his face. "You will pay even more for that. I will make sure you will be beggin' for my touch instead of being repulsed by it. Unless..." An evil gleam sparked his beady eyes. "You're growing that high and mighty foreigner's baby in your belly. Now wouldn't that be the apple in the pig's mouth!" He paused to think for a moment before blurting his thoughts. "Does he know about the babe?"

Roberts could tell by the expression on her face that she was pregnant and that Bergmann likely didn't know he was going to be a father.

"Revenge is sweet. He will never have you back now. He will never know if the babe is mine or his." An evil laugh range in her ears like a death knell. "He will never be able to look at it, not knowing. This is perfect. Just perfect."

He fell back on her, his mouth covering hers entirely, making her gag once again. If he smelled badly before, he was almost unbearable now. His words struck a chord in her mind. He was right. Dirk didn't know about the baby, and he would never believe it was his own. He would never love it or her again. She had lost it all regardless. She did not know if she could keep her sanity after learning how it felt to be cared for and loved. Somehow she would have to keep her will to live for the baby as it didn't sound like Roberts was going to harm it. Or was he? Consumed with her own thoughts, she never heard the commotion outside. She never saw the rage on Dirk's face as he kicked open the locked bedroom door, shattering the wood into splinters. She never heard his growl as he ripped Robert's from his wife's person. She never saw the knife slice Robert's neck in one easy swipe nor did she hear him whimper one last time as his lifeless body slid to the floor.

Reality only began to seep back into her world as a familiar voice spoke softly in her ears, stating declarations of love and devotion and happiness about babies and family. She was afraid to open her eyes as she felt her mind has truly slipped this time. Her sharp intake of breath and full body shudder almost convinced her that this was what insanity felt like, but instead of smelling smoky vomit, she smelled the familiar scent of her husband. She breathed in the restoring fragrance of sandalwood and spice.

"Blaze Ann. Open your eyes. Look at me. It's over." Concern laced his commands. "Blaze Ann. It's me. Dirk. Bergmann. Your husband. Please open your eyes. I love you."

Her bindings were cut loose and limbs fell limply to the filthy mattress. She clenched her lids shut tighter. She knew this was a cruel trick of the mind.

"Blaze Ann, open your eyes. Look at me. Don't you have something you need to tell me?" He probed her gently, searching for injuries. "Something about a baby?"

Her eyes flew open, locking her focus on her husband. "You came for us." She breathed a sigh of relief.

"Of course I came for my beautiful wife and child. I love you both." He stroked her still flat stomach. "Did you expect any less?"

"Roberts?" Her voice quivered.

"He will never bother us again."

"The men waiting to shoot you?" Fear began to ebb from her body.

"Were very reasonable when I got here. Seems they weren't as loyal as Roberts had hoped." He smiled as he recalled the cowards' rapid retreat.

"Can we go home now?" She fell limp into his arms as he scooped her into his arms.

His answer came without hesitation. "I'd like nothing more, my love."

*****

Ann found herself propped up in the middle of the large bed with several soft pillows behind her back and head. Dirk hovered near as if she was going to disappear into thin air. He maintained the excuse that the damage to her hands had sent them back to square one as he inspected the thick bandages covering both.

Mrs. Arp and Dr. Lanier gave knowing glances at each other and discretely left them alone after a thorough examination. Ann had been given strict orders to stay in bed until she was completely healed for the health of the baby. Despite the bruises, aches, and pains, she crossed her arms over her stomach and smiled. He loved her and they were going to be a family. This was so much more than she had ever imagined, and all because she let her mind stay open to the future.

"What are you smiling about, minx?" Dirk caught the brief reflection of emotion crossing her face with relief.

"I am happy beyond belief." She reveled in contentment and wonderment.

"Are you feeling okay?" He prodded her again.

"I am fine, love. I've never been better." She reassured him.

"Good. We have one more visitor today. I hope it is not too much for you to bear." He caressed her cheek with the back of his hand where it was mottled with a purplish black bruise. His anger flared anew.

"As long as you are with me, I can face anything. Who is it?"

Tiger jumped on the bed between them, meowing his protest.

"Sheriff Johnson." He watched her flinch. "No matter what, Blaze, you are mine. Remember that. I love you and I take care of my own."

"I am so ashamed." She hoped he meant those words. "I am so ashamed. I bargained myself for a brass tub. I would been forced to submit to... him," She spat out her disgust. "For what? An object. A material object that is not worth anything. I know it was my mama's brass tub, but what was I thinking?"

"You were thinking that you would not lose. If Roberts had been any manner of a decent man, you would not have been put in that position. If the people of this town had been any sort of decent folk, they would not have propelled you to desperation. Roberts built his entire life taking advantage of the less fortunate. Indirectly, the citizens aided him with their unreasonable fear of Banks. You were not his first and would not have been the last. He was a sick man." Dirk then told her about the horrors he had found when he searched Robert's home: the sinister dungeon, the keepsake box of souvenirs from many victims, and a log of all the people past and present who owned some type of compensation for a loan.

"What if he had succeeded? What then?" She uttered her fears aloud for the first time. "I was ignorant."

"Just like you told me, you are a survivor. You were doing what you thought you had to do to hold on to a memory. He took advantage of you, but he'll never do it again."

Her husband reassured her.

It was time for her to ask the question. She had to know the answer. "Did you know about the terms of the contract? Does it make you think less of me? Does it make you hate me? Does it make me an unworthy guttersnipe as he claimed?"

His stormy blue eyes were decidedly calm. "I knew. Why do you think we were married in such haste? I could not bear the thought of that scum so much as even touching the hem of your dress."

"So you paid my loan in full?" She whispered softly.

"Ten times the amount and I would have paid a hundred more." He confessed. "He was never supposed to bother you again. I warned him what would happen if he did, and I keep my word. Fortunately I have the signed contract in writing. Sheriff Johnson won't be able to press charges against me, but I do suspect he will make our lives a bit difficult."

Her mouth dropped open. "Ten times the amount?"

An easy smile broke across his face. "A mere pittance for you, my love."

*****

Christmas arrived at the Bergmann home with a fury. The weather had turned chill and snow flurries covered the red clay hills like powdered sugar. It was a beautiful site, but Ann stared out the windows as she secretly wished her unborn child would have fields of green to run through and tall trees to climb. Dropping the curtain as she felt Dirk's loving embrace around her stomach, she turned to him with a kiss.

"Are you ready, love?"

"Yes." She looked at her still bandaged hands. "But I don't have a gift for you. I wasn't able to knit..."

"You have given me the greatest gift of all. You." He rubbed her slightly rounding middle. "And family, love, adventure, and hope for the future."

As they gathered around the spindly pine that was strung with popcorn and red ribbons, Ann felt a myriad of emotions overwhelm her. How could one girl be so lucky? Again, Pa's words mad their way through her mind about kindness and generosity. He was right. He truly was. She startled as a small flat package was placed on her lap.

Dirk hovered over her, smiling wickedly as she toyed with the wrapping paper. "Oh go ahead and open it. Don't be so slow!"

"You are worse than a child!" She playfully admonished as she pulled free a small oil painting of a smiling young woman in breeches. "Is this me?" She squeaked as she could not fail to recognize her own features captured on canvas. "Did you paint this yourself?" The subject's mischievous smile was reflected by her own.

"I forget your comments about our wedding portrait. I wanted our future relatives to know the true Blaze Ann I fell in love with. I hope you like it." Dirk shuffled his feet just like an unsure little boy.

"I love it. I have never been given anything so fine." Looking closer to the background of lush green, she had one more question. "Where am I standing in this portrait?"

"Well..." Dirk hesitated. "That is important, you see. I have one more gift for you and I hope you aren't disappointed. "In the spring, we are moving to our new home in Cleveland, Tennessee."

Ann looked to him in surprise.

"We will leave as soon as the weather breaks and will be there before the baby is born. I have commissioned a coach with every comfort in mind. I'm sorry for the short notice, but it is upon the urging of Mr. Raht that we must leave."

"Is it because of the Robert's situation?" She probed warily.

"No, much more than that. It seems there has been fallout between Raht and the Union Consolidated Mining ownership. The Union owes him more than a hundred thousand dollars and he's taking them to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, he has opened the Cleveland National Bank and wants me to oversee it."

Her eyes were wide with astonishment.

"I know. Dirk Bergmann, pick pocket criminal as a bank president. Raht does have a sense of humor. He also expressed concern for the dangers of mining and didn't want our child to grow up without a father. Seems I owe him once again."

"I am anxious to make this move, as long as you are by my side." Ann caressed the portrait once more.

"That is where I'll always be, love. I knew you would take the news well. You are a Copper Chameleon. You are not afraid to adapt to this ever-changing world. You are my hero."

"Likewise, my love." She purred. "But I do have one more question. What about Mrs. Arp?"

"I hope you don't mind, but I have deeded this house to her with the hopes she'll open a restaurant. That's always been her dream."

"She won't come with us?" Ann could only hope.

"No. She said this is her home. I tried."

Ann grimaced. "I guess you'll learn what a poor cook I am now."

He pulled her into his arms. "I could care less about your cooking skills."

"And what are we going to live on? Love?" The spark between them ignited once again.

"Sounds good to me. You can burn it on the newfangled cast iron stove in our new house for all I care. Just think, in the future, I'm sure an inept wife will be able to destroy a meal in a matter of minutes!"

"A real cook stove? Are you kidding me?" Her voice squeaked. "I've only cooked over open fires!"

"Not anymore, Blaze Ann. We are moving into the future. Are you ready?"

"One day, an inept husband my have to burn his own food!" She countered. "After all, we are heading into the future." She turned and ascended the stairs after giving him her best come hither look.

"Whatever you say, minx, whatever you say." He couldn't, no wouldn't disagree.

Copper Basin, Tennessee 2014

Anna Caroline Bergman methodically turned off all the cameras and recording equipment in the car she drove for an internet and mobile communications company. It was the perfect summer job for a college student. Her duties were to travel at a certain speed and record her journey. From there, roadside snapshots and video would be archived in an internet mapping program so virtual travelers could see the world from their fingertips. The project was well underway and she had readily volunteered for this particular section of the United States. She had even scheduled her break today to coincide with this particular stopover of her trip. As she exited the car, she inhaled sharply as the large open crater just visible beyond a rusty iron fence slipped into view. The wind even seemed to pick up speed as she gazed into an endless pit resembling the damage inflicted from a large fallen meteor. An equally worn historical sign proudly proclaimed that spot as the Burra Burra Mine.

Her family's humble beginnings started here in the copper mines. She marveled at the collapsed pit as the breeze whispered a narrative beyond the hard cold facts she had memorized while tracing her family tree. This particular mine had closed in 1958. It boasted of a vertical shaft over 2,400 feet, one of the deepest vertical shafts in North America. Simply reading a book about the area could have never prepared her for how she felt as she looked into what seemed to be an endless abyss filled with greenish water. She shuddered at the thought of going underground that far just to dig for copper ore.

Her great, great, great grandmother had done just that according to the stories passed down from generation to generation. Amazingly the defiant woman had possessed the courage to perform a man's job in a man's world. Of course, Anna Caroline knew by the mischievous grin her ancestor wore in a small tattered oil portrait, the woman could not possibly have been a traditional female role model of the day. Why, Ann Marie Ward Bergmann was even wearing pants in the old oil painting. Her attire alone was morally incorrect and disgraceful for that era. She must have been a trendsetter! The time old tale even speculated that Ann Marie's husband had painted the portrait himself as a gift to his new wife for their first Christmas. It was rumored that theirs was a strong passionate union ignited from love at first site. Anna Caroline truly wished she knew the saga in its entirety as she found it fascinating and was always searching for more information. She felt it was in her blood since she had been partially named for that distant relation due to her coppery red hair, now tangled by the errant gusts of wind. On her sixteenth birthday, the small oil portrait and a wedding tintype had been passed into her care. She could almost feel the strength of their love and determination from the two small items she considered family treasures. She truly hoped she could emulate her great, great, great grandmother, if only just by a fraction. She too must become a trendsetter if she hoped to make it in the competitive world of communications and journalism, even if it meant breaking up with a guy who didn't quite have her best interests in mind. She closed her eyes for a moment, remembering his demands of college or him. She had chosen college. She reminded herself once more that someone that selfish could not have possibly loved her. It was not a love like Ann Marie and Dirk Bergmann possessed. Taking a deep breath, she knew she had chosen the right path.

Shaking off the flitting melancholy mood, she noticed the Ducktown / Copper Basin Museum hours of operation sign and it just happened to be open. It was her lunch break so she decided to take a tour. Perhaps she might see a glimpse of her relatives' past in the small wooden building. She jumped back into her car to properly park, thumping her chameleon Webpet on the nose. It was a mascot of sorts, another sixteenth birthday gift, and it lived on the dash of every car she drove. It was an important reminder to continue to adapt or to become extinct. She told him she would be right back and that she was just making one short stopover in the past to quietly observe. When she returned, she would be ready to look ahead to her future.

Author's Note:

All mining operations ceased in 1987 in the Copper Basin area. With a lack of diversified industry, the small surrounding towns failed to thrive. If you ever choose to visit the area, do not focus on the deserted 1960's style store fronts or rutted roads. Instead, take a seat on the front porch, pour yourself an iced tea, and wait the moon to rise. If you listen carefully you might just hear the sounds of picks and shovels just beneath the quiet rustling of the breeze.
