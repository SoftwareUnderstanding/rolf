### This ebook is a collection of answers given by Jesus (AJ Miller) on the topic of cults and cult leaders. The answers were given in an interview with Mary Magdalene (Mary Luck), who posed frequently asked questions from members of the media and public, on 13th November 2012 in Wilkesdale, Queensland, Australia. In this session Jesus discusses issues such as what is the common definition of a cult, and whether Jesus is the leader of one.

1. Do you feel that "care" is owed to God?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice)" it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and its observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin _cultus_ ) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Do you feel that "care" is owed to God?

Well firstly, if I can point out that the word 'cult' comes from the Latin _'cultus'_ , which actually literally means 'care,' so the suggestion is that all religions need take care for the way in which they worship God. If they don't care for it, they don't have enough piety and therefore you know they are probably not observing that particular religion. It is interesting that the underlying word, the word that 'cult' comes from is implying that God needs to be cared for. The reality is that God does not need to be cared for. God is self-caring, self-responsible, God does not need to be cared for and God is not seeking our worship. There is this common viewpoint on the planet, I feel, that God is seeking worship and God does not seek worship. God knows Herself very well and knows Her value and She does not need us to support Her value or to make Her feel better about Herself than She already feels. In fact the underlying word of 'cult' is implying that. Now if you look at how the word is used today, it is often applied to a cult leader and I am often associated with being one. If you look at the underlying thing again, it is like, does a person, does one single person need to be cared for and honoured above all others? The answer to that is also: no. Any person who has any degree of self-responsibility and love for themselves does not need to be cared for by any other person, and therefore does not need to be worshipped or even listened too. God does not have an investment in us listening to God and any person who is an appropriate spiritual leader would also not have any investment in another person listening to them.

By 'an appropriate spiritual leader' I mean a spiritual leader who is not invested in other people's opinion of them and who is just interested in telling the truth.

2. Do you feel that God punishes those who neglect worship of God?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice) it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin cultus) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Do you feel that God punishes those who neglect worship of God?

Definitely not. In fact, God does not even desire our worship. God desires our love, which is a very different thing to desiring to be worshipped. Somebody who feels a lack within themselves generally, wanting somebody else to support that lack by providing them with feelings that they wouldn't otherwise have is desiring to be worshipped. God doesn't do that with us. All God desires is a relationship with us and God desires that we have this relationship in a sincere, frank, open, truthful manner.

God certainly does not desire our worship in the sense of desiring all of these reverential emotions given to God. However many people who come to know God do finish up giving those particular emotions to God, because of the honour they feel towards God and that is a different matter, whether God desires it or whether the person desires to give it. God desires a close relationship with each one of Her children, very similar to the type of relationship that a parent desires with its children on earth.

It is very important for us to understand that God does not demand that we worship God but rather God desires a relationship with us based on love. I don't believe God demands worship and therefore God does not want to punish the people who do not worship God. This whole concept that 'the people who do not worship God will be punished' comes from a very human trait of punishing people who do not give honour.

God is okay with the concept of giving us free will and this means that God is also accepting of the fact that we might not honour God or we might not worship God. God still makes the sun shine and makes it rain upon the righteous and the wicked because God is not selective in the way in which God gives Her gifts to all of Her children. However God recognises that there are some children who will receive God's gifts differently and who will desire to have the closer personal relationship with God and under those circumstances more Love flows to that particular person because of their desire for it.

3. Do you feel that external religious practice makes a person sacred?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice)" it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin cultus) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Do you feel that external religious practice makes a person sacred?

Definitely not. In fact what I have found in my personal experience is that many people who have an attitude of piety or an attitude of being holy are often some of the least holy or impious persons on the planet because they use their piety as a justification for violence. What is true is that there is only really one religious practice that is God's definition of a religious practice and that is, whenever we love. Whenever we act in a loving manner towards another person or thing we are automatically in a state of piety, if you like. We are not creating an alternate state based on belief systems but rather we have a feeling and a desire to love and this feeling and desire to love - that is true religion.

4. Do you feel that neglecting religious practice is impiety or a lack of reverence for God?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice)" it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin cultus) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Do you feel that neglecting religious practice is impiety or a lack of reverence for God?

No, I don't believe God ever established any religious practice. The fact is that almost all religious practices that I have observed on this planet have been the result of a person or a group of people deciding upon a religious practice that was acceptable to God without asking God whether that particular practice was acceptable. The concept that God has a desire for a certain type of practice is, I feel, fraught with a lot of impossibilities and dangers. Whenever we establish a concept about God that is our own, we are automatically establishing a concept that is out of harmony with God's concept of Himself.

The reality is that God does not demand that we worship God, God does not even demand reverence from us; however God desires love, and love automatically does certain things when we are truly loving. We automatically desire to know the person, desire to understand the person, desire to understand their will and their long term intentions; all of these other things are a part of desire with regard to love.

I feel quite strongly that religious practices are fraught with dangers and in fact I don't want to establish any religious practice. However there is possibly one practice and I would not actually call it a practice, but rather a desire that God is looking for, from us, and that is this desire for God's Love, the desire to have a relationship with God. If there is any practice at all, the singular practice that we need to be involved in is desire for a relationship with God. In that desire we will generate a desire for Truth, a desire to be humble, but these will be desires and not forced upon us by our relationship with God. And they certainly won't be forced upon us by God Herself. God has no interest in forcing us to do anything and if we do not desire love and if we do not desire humility then of course God will allow us to make that choice.

5. Do you believe people should be rejected for not having the same beliefs?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice)" it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin cultus) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Do you believe people should be rejected for not having the same beliefs?

Definitely not! No single person should ever be rejected under any circumstances with the exception of perhaps one, and that is when they have harmed other people's will; they need to be shown that that particular desire to harm another person's will was out of harmony with love. Rather than rejecting them it needs to be demonstrated to them how that was out of harmony with love and they need to be restricted from those particular practices.

Many people in the human race now already do that, in terms of most governments doing this. For example, when it comes to murder, most governments on the planet accept that murder is not the correct action to take towards another person. Whenever a person does take that action they are generally restricted in some way, usually by being placed in a prison and so forth and restricted from taking that action again, hopefully until the time they've recovered from the reason why they wanted to take the action.

Of course unfortunately on the planet there is not much focus on the person's recovery but rather on punishing the person. God's focus though is on the person's recovery. With regards to there ever being an excommunication, if you like, of an individual from a religion, every time we excommunicate someone from something we no longer give them the opportunity to grow. That is going to mean not excommunication but rather addressing the issue that's out of harmony with love in the individual and addressing that issue, sometimes firmly if need be, but certainly not with any desire for punishment or violence.

So every time a person is excommunicated from a religion I believe the religion itself is just demonstrating its own "cult"-like behaviour. There are many mainstream religions on this planet that do this, and this would indicate that many mainstream religions are cultish in their particular desires because they wish to control the actions of the individual even if the actions of the individual have still been loving, but not what they believe is pious.

I feel quite strongly that the important factor should be whether the individual is practicing love or not. If the individual is not practising love then there certainly needs to be some kind of restriction of their behaviour, but we would never take those restrictive actions from a place of rejection or a place of rage or anger towards them or a desire to punish them. What we would do is desire to correct them by demonstrating love to them and also demonstrating to them when they are out of harmony with love themselves.

6. Are you setting up a new religion?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (religious practice)" it states in the first few lines "In traditional usage, the cult of a religion, quite apart from its sacred writings ("scriptures"), its theology or myths, or the personal faith of its believers, is the totality of external religious practice and observance, the neglect of which is the definition of impiety. Cult in this primary sense is literally the "care" (Latin cultus) owed to the god and the shrine."

**Mary:** Are you setting up a new religion?

Definitely not! I have no desire to set up a new religion. The main reason I have no desire to set up a new religion is that I believe that almost every religion that's ever been set up on this planet has been the ideas of men and how those men believe God wants to be worshipped. As I've already stated in other questions, I don't believe God needs our worship. God desires our love and a relationship with us and for that reason God does not need our worship. God does not need a religious practice in order to be validated.

I feel quite strongly that there is no need to set up another religion. We need to have every single organisation on this planet come into more harmony with love and that includes every single religious organisation, because there are many religious organisations on this planet that are completely out of harmony with love and completely out of harmony with ethical behaviour towards other people. We need to bring each religion into harmony with love and ethical behaviour.

The golden rule, if you like, that I taught in the 1st century: unless we are willing to treat other people how we would like to be treated, it's really impossible for a religion to have any benefit at all. Now a person can go on practising their religious practice if they want to, but they must come to understand at some point that these practices have all been defined by other people, usually other men, sometimes other women and these particular practices have no bearing on a person's relationship with God. I feel quite strongly that we need to change this and start seeing that love is the thing God is concerned about, not religious practice based around some kind of definition of humanity.

7. Do you have any beliefs that are strange?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult (disambiguation)" it states in the first line "A cult references a group whose beliefs or practices are considered strange."

**Mary:** Do you have any beliefs that are strange?

No, I don't believe I have any beliefs that are strange; however perhaps many other people who have listened to some of my beliefs think they are strange. Mind you I could probably say the same about their beliefs on many occasions. In fact I believe that many of the beliefs that I observe in most religions are quite strange. If that is the definition of a cult, then that would pretty much define every single religion and other organisations that are strange as a cult.

I don't believe that somebody that is strange or different should be defined as someone who's a cult or part of a cult. Cults to me a very very different organisations and we'll talk I think more fully about that through answering other questions. But I can't see how a person who is different or a group of people who are different should be labelled.

My feelings are that every single person on this planet, no matter what their background, cultural, sexual, political or otherwise, should be honoured and loved. I feel that once we have that attitude towards all people we won't be going around labelling different people as members of cults or not members of cults or members of religions or not members of religions; rather we'll be labelling every person perhaps as a child of God who deserves my love.

8. Do you suggest any practices that are strange?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult, Disambiguation" it states in the first line "A cult references a group whose beliefs or practices are considered strange."

**Mary:** Do you suggest any practices that are strange?

As I have said many times in my discussions with people and on the YouTube presentations, I do not believe that there is any practice at all that we need to engage in our worship of God because I do not believe that God desires our worship but rather God desires our love and a relationship. I do feel that there are certain things that will help us with regard to that relationship. One of those things is a desire for God's Love which I view as prayer; another one of those things is a desire for God's Truth which I also view as a prayer for truth, and the third thing that I view as quite important is a desire for personal humility, something that we need to do to see ourselves more accurately. We need to be honest about ourselves. These are things that I believe are important in our relationship with God.

I do not believe that they can be practiced. They can either be desired and felt or not; we can't go through some kind of intellectual practice by rote that earns us a place with God. God is more intelligent than that and also understands more about us then we do. If we believe that we can just go through a heap of intellectual practices while at the same time having unloving emotions, then we have a very poor opinion of God, in my opinion. If we believe that we can get away with having all these terrible emotions coming out of us, all these unloving things that we do to other people, and then still believe that God is going to accept us, we have to relook at the whole situation. We have got to see that God is far more intelligent and far more loving than a God who would accept that kind of worship.

So I feel that no religious practice is necessary to connect to God. I do feel that a desire and longing for God is necessary to connect to God. That is going to involve three things - a desire to long for God's Love, a desire to long for God's Truth, and personal humility, the ability to see myself as God sees me, warts and all, and to be the person that I truly am, and to work on recovering this person if the person I truly (currently) am is out of harmony with love. These are the only things necessary for us to have any relationship with God. Anything else, any other religious observance is a manmade creation that is completely unnecessary in our relationship with God.

### 9. Why are new groups initially mostly considered as cults?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Under this definition, almost any new group would be considered a "cult"; what would you say about that?

Well that's correct. I feel for a start what myself and Mary are setting up is not a new religious movement. It's certainly not new because it's something we set up 2,000 years ago anyway, and it's not a religious movement in the sense that we are not interested in having worship or priests or any of those other things, we are interested only in a direct connection with God that every single member of humanity can engage. We're not interested in setting up a new religious movement.

However people who know us do group together at times; in other words myself and Mary arrange a seminar and a whole heap of people come along and sometimes it's the same people who came along last time although not always. And so my feelings are with regard to that every time we have a seminar, we're not setting up a new religious group, we're just presenting a series of information about what we have personally learnt about God and relationship with God, the human soul and many other important aspects.

I feel though, that under some of the definitions of 'cult' that you could find in Wikipedia and dictionaries and elsewhere, almost any religion could be viewed as a cult. My personal opinion is that the word nowadays has a connotation of evil to it and at some point we need to discuss why it has a connotation of evil to it. The reality I feel is that there is no need for us to keep labelling different things on the planet as having evil or not evil, we just need to see when something is out of harmony with love and bring it into harmony with love and if every religion and every political organisation and every medical organisation on the planet and every other type of organisation, company or otherwise, on the planet brought all their practices into harmony with love, we would have a lovely environment in which to live and enjoy our life. In particular if the family brought their particular practices into complete harmony with love, we would just have a wonderful existence on this planet.

The reality is though, we don't have a wonderful existence and the reason, the only problem we face, is defining what love is. Whenever we set up different religious observances we are not defining what love is, we are defining something different. And God is only interested in love, not in all these other things that we're trying or attempting to define. God is certainly interested in truth as well, but not at the expense of love. So we must always focus on the fact that we need to be loving and that is going to be the only, if there is a so-called religious practice, that would be the only religious practice we would be involved in.

I believe that a lot of the definitions we find about cults, you know in the world today, are all about people's fears being applied to certain groups of people. They generally have nothing to do with reality but rather the application of people's fears. Years and years ago, for example, the Catholic Church in the 2nd century of this millennium was viewed as a cult. The government was so afraid of it that it was attacked and bitterly persecuted for a long period of time until the government decided to make the church its state religion. Then all of a sudden it became not a cult anymore, all the other religions that weren't the state religion became cults. This is an illustration of how we manipulate the word in order to punish people who have a different belief from ourselves, because we're afraid. If we are truly loving, which is what God desires us to be, we would never imply these particular things and certainly never act violently towards another group of people, no matter what their belief.

10. Do you have a group of people that you organize in any way?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Do you have a group of people that you organize in any way?

No. The only people that I actually organise are the people who help us set up a venue for a seminar and help us dismantle the venue after the seminar, and the people who actually help us with the distribution of divine truth on the planet. Now there are many, many more people than that who come along to our seminars, or come along to presentations or workshops that Mary runs, or different interviews that we do, but we don't generally organise them. Generally some other people may organise them. But what we do primarily is just rock up at any request from any person, depending on whether we want to or not, deliver the information we wish to deliver if it's desired to be heard, and then we leave. And we have a group of people who then get that information and produce it onto the internet, so that other people can share in the information that was presented.

That's the only things that we actually organise. We don't organise a religion. We don't have a hierarchy of any kind. We don't try to organise people to do things every week. We don't have a religious church service; we don't have a church at all in fact. And we don't have any other things most people believe we have from the media reports.

11. Do you have any beliefs or practices that are abnormal or bizarre?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Do you have any beliefs or practices that are abnormal or bizarre?

I would say that we don't have any beliefs or practices that are abnormal or bizarre, but again it depends upon a person's definition of abnormal or bizarre. A lot of people on the planet believe that feeling an emotion is abnormal and so if feeling an emotion is abnormal for you, then you will certainly believe that when we feel our emotion we are being abnormal.

My feeling is that, no, every single little child who enters this planet is able to feel its emotions perfectly, so that's normal, and then we turn it into being something abnormal. I feel what is defined as normal or abnormal, bizarre or acceptable almost completely depends upon what somebody has been brought up with over their life. Most people would suggest getting a baby at a certain age and then cutting off the flesh around its penis, which is what happens at circumcision, is a pretty abnormal thing to do, but then there are other people who believe it's a part of their life and has been a part of their life for thousands of years and so they believe it's the normal thing to do.

There are other practices such as getting a child who's only a few days old and sprinkling it with water and saying that it's now baptised and therefore saved is pretty abnormal, whereas other people, in fact over a billion and a half people on this planet generally practice that with every one of the children that they have. So I believe that there are many practices happening in religious practice that any other person observing could say, "That's pretty abnormal," but which the people involved feel is pretty normal because they have been brought up with that particular practice.

We do not engage in any of those practices. However we do feel our emotions, as a child would. We do have a desire for God because that's a part of having a relationship with God, and we do examine ourselves a lot because we're quite humble and we want to examine ourselves a lot. If a person believes that all of those practices are abnormal then so be it. I don't believe they're abnormal; I think that's part of being what I would classify as a good or righteous person.

12. Do you have a system of ritual practices?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Do you have a system of ritual practices?

Definitely not. There is no system of ritual or religious practice that we suggest to anyone. We do make some suggestions about them feeling their feelings and emotions because we feel this is a very important part of having a relationship with God. We also make suggestions about praying, in other words having a desire for God, having a longing for God. We also make suggestions that people analyse themselves, that they look at themselves honestly and examine their own concept of themselves to see whether or not it's actually loving, whether the things they are doing are actually loving or not.

We ask people to examine their treatment of other people, you know, whether they are treating other people in a loving manner. We ask people to examine how they are treating their environment, but we don't have any practice to do it. We just present a whole series of information to people in just the same way as any other person on this planet presents a seminar. So even someone like Wayne Dyer or Deepak Chopra would go further than we do about presenting what I would classify to be rituals. Many of them believe in practicing meditation for example; we don't even suggest that. We don't suggest any practice, but we do suggest the need to develop desire to have a relationship with God, a relationship with your partner, a relationship based on love with God and your partner and others, and a relationship with your children, a relationship with your friends, a relationship with the environment. We suggest that we need to always examine these particular relationships and do whatever we can on a daily basis to improve them. But I don't feel that that is like a religious practice or a regular practice that needs to be done, it is just something that is a daily occurrence. Any person on this planet, if they are sincere in becoming more loving, would have that kind of self-examination.

They can also be a member of any religion and have that kind of self-examination. They can be a member of any political party and have that kind of self-examination. I believe that all of the things that Mary and myself are teaching can be incorporated into any organisation on the planet, religious or otherwise, and that organisation will improve in its ability to love other organisations and people. So that's what we suggest to people.

Now of course many people go, "Well, that's pretty abnormal," because they believe that the only time you should love somebody is when they're your friend or the only time you should love something is when you know you're getting something from it or whatever. But we feel that you should always love something even if the thing is attacking you; you need to love it and we need to learn how to love all people in all interactions.

That's what we teach. Now many people I suppose may think that's abnormal, but I can't see why they'd be frightened of that kind of concept.

13. How would you define a "cult"?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** How would you define a "cult"?

If it was me defining a cult I would be looking at quite a number of areas. The first area would be its level of control over other people. I believe quite strongly that no one should have control over another person. In fact God gave us free will and the ability to choose. I feel a cult is any organisation or individual who attempts to have control over another group of people or individual. Many times, under that definition, families would turn into cults, and religions would turn into cults. Secondly, I feel that any person who is desiring worship is automatically going to be part of a cult. As I've stated earlier or in other questions, God does not demand our worship; therefore any person who demands our worship or demands our honour is out of harmony with God, and therefore out of harmony with love. I feel that that would be the second thing I would look at: whether people are demanding to be worshiped or demanding to be honoured.

Aside from that I would look at practices that demean or demonstrate a lack of love towards the individual. I believe that any practice that would attack an individual, demean them in some way, is not honest but is a desire to manipulate and control - that would also be something that a cult would do. Fourth, I believe that if there is such a thing as a cult, it would be a group of people who are willing to deceive other people. Now in that condition many organisations and individuals on this planet would come under that definition.

I feel that any time we purposefully attempt to deceive another we are automatically placing ourselves in a position where we are taking away the power of the other. I believe that what needs to happen is that we need to help people have the power to make their own choices and decisions, which is the opposite of taking away their power. We need to tell them the truth and then let them decide for themselves how they wish to act. If we withhold truth from people we are not telling them the truth and then we are deciding for them how they should act. Many people are not told the truth by governments, religions and other organisations and I feel that this is a way in which many organisations control individuals. This is completely out of harmony with love and I feel cultish behaviour.

I feel that those four things that I have mentioned are probably the main things that I would be looking at, if I was looking at a person and asking myself the question as to whether they were a cult or not. Obviously too there is a fifth element and that is this element of violence, if there is any element of violence or the potential for violence in the particular organisation that we're looking at. I feel that that is also an element of cultish behaviour. If we look at that, even some governments have that in them and again some governments would come under that definition.

If we truly love we won't desire violence to be perpetrated towards another in any circumstance or situation. If we truly care about other people we won't perpetrate violence ourselves. I believe that any organisation that perpetrates violence towards any other individual or organisation on the planet is automatically out of harmony with love. In doing so they are automatically placing themselves in a position of power or control over the other people. And I believe that that is what a cult would do.

Those five particular things that I've mentioned I believe are the primary things that I would use to determine whether something is cultish or not in under today's definition of it. As I've previously stated, I do not believe that the original meaning of the word, coming from the Latin, meant any of those particular things. However the original meaning of the word did portray that God needs care and I do not believe God needs care. God does not need us at all; God desires us which is very different to needing us. And so I feel that whenever we use the word cult today it's usually used in negative connotation and if we were more intelligent about our assessment we'd look at those five particular things that I've just listed and ask ourselves the questions. Any organisation or individual that does not display those particular qualities would naturally not be a cult leader or even if he is being accused of being one.

14. Are you a "cult" leader?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Are you a "cult" leader?

I am definitely not a cult leader. If a person looks at my answer to the question about my own definition of what a cult is, I certainly do not come under the definition of any those particular things I have mentioned.

A cult leader is a person who promotes control of other people, a person who's willing to manipulate other people into doing what he wants, who desires worship and who desires control and power over others. I do not want any of those things.

Just because I am saying that I am Jesus, it doesn't automatically make me a cult leader. What would make me a cult leader is my desiring those particular things. As the bible record shows and as my own record in this century shows, I've never desired those particular things and so therefore I cannot be defined as a cult leader in my opinion, but of course that's just my opinion.

15. Do you require that people worship you?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** Do you require that people worship you?

Definitely not. I require that people do not worship me and that people worship God instead. That is what I require; in fact if anyone attempts to worship me, I reject their desire to worship me and correct this desire by stating to them that I do not want their worship. I do not want their worship and I do not need anything from them.

All I desire to do is teach any person who will listen about how to develop their relationship with God. I do not even believe that God needs our worship, but if we desire to worship someone, then my suggestion is to worship God, who is far greater than I, and far greater than any person. My suggestion is to never worship another person, because if you worship another person you are always, at some point in the future, going to be disappointed.

16. Why are people afraid of "cults"?

**Mary:** On Wikipedia, under "Cult" it states in the first lines "The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre. [1] The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices."

**Mary:** The public seem very fearful about "cults." Why do you feel that is?

Well, I feel that most of the public have been brought up in a cult, in the sense that most of the public have been brought up in the cult of family. If you examine almost every family, the behaviour generally is this: if any member of the family does not agree with the family, then generally they are expelled from the family or punished.

Now that is the action that I believe a cult would take. Because most people are brought up in the kind of environment where they're not really loved but they are either punished or bartered with, I believe that by the time they get to be adults, because those emotions have not yet been released from them, they are very sensitive to any organisation that tries to do the same thing as their parents did.

Interestingly enough, they still accept their parents doing what they have generally done all of their lives, but they are very sensitive to other people doing that particular thing to them. Understandably, so I believe, we should not ever have to put up with that kind of behaviour, where we are punished when we have a different point of view or opinion. And we should not ever have to put up with the behaviour where we barter with people for their love. However, that is what most people are brought up with and so that is what most people expect in a relationship, but they also become very sensitive to that kind of behaviour.

As a result of their sensitivity to that kind of behaviour, they then become very focused on attacking individuals or groups of people who they believe - and they only have to believe it, it doesn't have to be true - but any person or group that they believe has that behaviour, they then become very attacking of. Because in reality they have not released the emotions they have with their own parents, they have not worked their way through the issues of why their parents did what they did; they just take these emotions out on other people who are basically doing the same kind of thing as what they grew up with in their own family.

That is why I believe that the majority of people are afraid of cults. My opinion is that there's very little to be afraid of, because you can leave anything if you have free will, you are allowed to leave anything at any time. You don't have to get involved, you can use your mind and you can use your clear emotional state to determine whether you want to be there or not. And you should never be anywhere you do not want to be. So if a person truly had any respect of themselves, they would not need to fear the potential of any cult. They would not need to attack it.

I also believe that another reason why people become afraid of cults is that many cults get established having different beliefs to the original person who's afraid of them. The reason why that the person is afraid is that they are often questioning of their own belief structure and yet they are unable to do so in an open forum. For example, I could be of a certain type of religion, let's say I'm a catholic, and another religious group gets started up that directly contradicts my own belief system. There will be a great temptation within me to call that other religious group a cult. That way I can label the group and not have to examine their teachings to see how those teachings contradict my own and how my own teachings may be flawed. I feel a lot of people label other groups negatively because they are afraid of examining their own beliefs and afraid of examining their own emotions.

17. What do you say to the media comparing you to violent abusive people?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult - cite_note-9"

**Mary:** You have often been compared by the media to people who have encouraged violence, suicide, abuse, and criminal activity, such as David Koresh of the Branch Davidian movement.

**Mary:** What do you say about these claims?

Well firstly, as I have stated many times before, Mary and I are not setting up a new religious movement. We do not desire to set up a religion; we don't even desire to set up a group. All we desire to do is visit people who want to know more about their relationship with God and want more truth from God's perspective. We are willing to share that truth with anybody who asks. It doesn't matter what religion, what background, what political background, what cultural background, what country; we are completely open to discussing these particular matters with any individual.

We are not setting up a new religious group. All we are doing is sharing information that we believe is truth, to other people who are willing to listen to it; that is all we are doing. In that regard we are no different to any other person who does a similar thing, like some of the popular world-renowned people who are seminar presenters. Myself and Mary are not world-renowned but we are seminar presenters. We just present information to groups of people who desire to come along. We are different in that we don't charge for what we do, so people are allowed to come along for free and sit in the seminar for as long as they like, and leave whenever they want. They don't have to feel obliged to stay or obliged to leave or anything in-between.

We have a very strong viewpoint that all we are doing is sharing information. However a lot of the time, because I am saying that I am Jesus, most people then think that I am now setting myself up above other people and that I want to be worshipped and all these other things, which are not true. They assume these things about me because that's what other people who have said that they are Jesus have done in the past, or what they are currently doing on the planet. I am very different to those people but unfortunately because I am saying that I am Jesus I am lumped in the same barrow as these other people, as the Wikipedia article suggested. There is only a small minority of groups of people on this planet that are truly dangerous when it comes to any new movement, and yet they tar the brush for any other person.

Just because I am claiming that I am Jesus it does not mean that I want to set up a religious movement; it does not mean that I want worship, and it doesn't mean that I want to be the leader of any particular movement. All I want to do and all I have ever wanted to do is share what I believe is the Divine Truth to people on the planet, which they can discover for themselves actually, through their own processes; they don't need me in order to discover them. All I am doing is sharing what I have discovered; that is all. I am not doing anything more than that.

I don't have control over people, I don't manipulate people, I don't tell them what to do, I don't tell them how they should live their life. However, if they are not loving in their interaction with me I will walk away. That is the only limitation I place on any relationship with me: if you are going to be unloving towards me then I am probably not going to enjoy a relationship with you. Now I cannot see how that is comparable to these people that I am often compared to.

This is only a media beat-up attempting to make the association in people's mind between myself and these other people in order to have the media's viewpoint projected at the mass market. That's all it is. It's the media selling their own viewpoint using the fears of people they are selling it to, joining myself to these people who have been damaging and definitely harmful to other people on the planet.

I can't agree with the behaviour of these groups because they are unloving, just as I can't agree with the behaviour of the media because it is manipulative, controlling, power-hungry and therefore unloving. All I can do is continue to say what I am actually doing and that is that I am presenting information in seminars for free if anybody wants to come along and listen; that's all I am doing.

18. What do you say to media claims you are the leader of a "chilling cult"?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult - cite_note-9"

**Mary:** It has been said by the media that you are "the leader of one of the world's most chilling cults." What do you say to this?

Well, if talking about love, talking about truth, and being a humble person makes you chilling, then I'm chilling. (Laughs) But I would have to question why a person believes that somebody who talks about love and truth and humility is chilling. That in itself is chilling. Why would they believe such a thing? I can't understand how people can label me as chilling, when I'm one of the most easy to get along with, loving persons they could ever meet. And I certainly don't try to harm anybody or damage anybody or do anything harmful to somebody. So why would they believe that I'm chilling?

My suggestion is that the only reason why the media has said such things, because only the media has ever said such things to me, is that they want ratings and they want people to go into their fear, and the way they manipulate ratings is to have people afraid so lots more people will watch what they present. The reality is that many of these lie-based media reports about me, which I've commented about on our own website - I've listed many of the lies that the media has presented about us on our website for anybody to examine if they truly want to know the truth - these lie-based reports are all just a fabrication to manipulate people into believing something that will cause them to watch telly more so that the media outlets can get more advertising.

It's a complete distortion and a manipulation of the truth in order to get more money out of people. If I was the average person, particularly in Australia, but any member of the public, I'd be severely questioning their underlying motive, because the reality is that all I do is travel around the world at the invitation of others and share with them what I believe about love, truth and humility. That's what I do. If that's chilling to you, then I would suggest that you've got some major fear-based issues that you need to work through.

19. What do you say to the media comparing you with Jonestown & Waco?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult - cite_note-9"

**Mary:** People on internet forums have often said that anyone who listens to you is; "drinking the Kool-Aid" - which means both blindly jumping on the bandwagon, and being a team player," in reference to the Jonestown suicides. The media says you are "worse than Waco" referring to the USA government's fight with the Branch Davidian movement. What do you say to these people?

I find these comments laughable, to be frank. These are comments that are made by people who obviously have some very severe fear issues within themselves and it has no resemblance to the truth whatsoever. I am definitely not going to encourage anybody into a mass suicide. I disagree completely with suicide. I feel that while it's unfortunate that many people on earth do suicide, I feel that they have very severe emotional reasons for doing so, none of which I can agree that suicide is an option.

I feel instead that it would be better if they worked through the particular emotions that are driving them to suicide. When it comes to "drinking the Kool Aid," in other words everyone who listens to me is just sort of agreeing with me all the time, I cannot agree with that at all. If the average person comes along to a talk of mine they will see a fair majority of the people at different times do not agree with me at all. And I do not expect them to agree with me; however I expect them to treat me in a respectful and loving manner while they're at one of my seminars, where I've paid for the seat. And so I am certainly going to expect that they treat me in a manner that shows at least some respect.

However I don't expect them to believe me, worship me, follow what I say, or do what I say. I am just sharing information about what I've learnt with them. That is all. I am certainly not going to get any Kool Aid, poison it, and then ask people to drink it; it's such a ludicrous extension to make these illogical assumptions. I feel that people are so illogical. Like, there are now 700 hours of unedited material on YouTube about what I present. If they listen to all that material and if after listening they actually assume that I'm going to suggest a mass suicide at some point, they are crazy, to be frank, not me, they are crazy, because it is something that has never crossed my mind.

I believe that people who say these things about me are just fear-mongering and being controlling and manipulative of other people who are afraid. If the average person came along to a seminar they would feel very similar to any person who attends any seminar on any matter, let alone a religious one - if there is such a presentation on religious matters even in our seminars. I feel quite strongly that these accusations are so far from the truth that they are manipulative, controlling, they are lies and at some point in time I would suggest to any person listening to it, that they come along to a seminar and see for themselves or they look at the 700 hours of YouTube seminars that are already there, in context, and see what is actually going on.

I am just a guy presenting a heap of information to anybody who wants to listen. That's all I am.

20. Do you have a "cult" headquarters?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult - cite_note-9"

**Mary:** Do you have a "cult" headquarters?

(Laughs) No. We don't have a cult, so we can't have a headquarters. Actually it's interesting; the original statement about that came from the Channel 7 crew, who actually stayed in our home. They came here to this home, stayed in our home, in both of our bedrooms. We let them have both of our bedrooms, and we went down into a tent, and while they were staying in our home they did all of this filming and all of this stuff going around, which later they called their hidden camera filming, which they came to do. And then in their reports, they called it the cult headquarters and since then almost every media outlet has said, "Where's your cult headquarters?" And we've had people even come to visit us here, who say to us "Oh, is this your cult headquarters, is this your headquarters?" and we go, "No, this is our home, for goodness sake, like, what do you think is going on here?"

It all came about just because the Channel 7 TV programme wanted to portray us as a cult, having some kind of headquarters and large amounts of money that we had disposable. This is a home I bought before I met Mary, seven or eight years ago, before anybody gave me any donation whatsoever. I bought this home out of my own funds that I earned during business and now it's being referred to as the cult headquarters that somebody else has donated to us. And I find that quite amusing.

21. Do you call your home the "headquarters"?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be."

**Mary:** Do you call your home the "headquarters"?

Do I call my home "the headquarters"? (Laughs) No. I call my home a home. Mary calls our home our home. Perhaps we sometimes have other words for our home, (laughs) but certainly not "the headquarters."

The whole "headquarters" accusation comes from the Channel 7 film crew, who stayed with us at our home, and they then called our home, that they stayed in, "the headquarters," just so that they could gain some kind of media outrage about what we're doing. Along with a lot of other lies they told at the time, they also said that there were hidden cameras at our seminars, when actually we have photographs and videos in our seminars of the cameras that were meant to have been hidden, so you know, they lied so much during these reports. They lied mostly because they knew they'd probably get away with it with me and I probably wouldn't attack them or take them to court.

And because they knew that, they then decided to lie as much as they wanted to and they know they'll probably get away with it until somebody comes along and watches this kind of Frequently Asked Question presentation, where we can say the truth to them about what actually happened.

But unfortunately most people listen to the media, believe that they're telling the truth and then don't assume that there is other information available that would indicate that the media has lied. In this case the media has lied consistently over and over and over again and still continues to do so and yet most people do not even consider questioning them.

I find that quite concerning, the fact that media can lie so much and have no self-regulation about the lies. The so-called code of practice here in Australia is a farce, because the media can lie so much and get away with it, and nobody whatsoever addresses it. This is the reason why we do our own presentations, because in my opinion you cannot trust anything that the media says to you.

Nowadays we find it very, very difficult to trust anything the media says, as a result of how the media has treated us, because if the media has treated us this way, we have to question how the media is treating every person that they interview and how the media is falsifying everything that seems to occur or at least putting it out of harmony with truth. I'm sure there must be some people in the media who have ethics, but I personally have yet to meet one of them.

22. Have you been given property from other people, that you live on?

**Mary:** Wikipedia says; "In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law-abiding it may be. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult - cite_note-9"

**Mary:** Have you been given property from other people, that you live on?

No we have not been given property from any person. The media is constantly stating to us that we have been; in fact I had an interview a few weeks ago where the interviewer asked me, or stated in his opening remarks, that I was living on a 600 acre property donated by other people. This is not true. I said to him in the interview that this was not true.

Myself and Mary live on a 40 acre property that I bought seven or eight years ago now, here in the local area near Kingaroy. We do not own any other property. We do not control any other property. We do not push any other person around who has any other property. We only give advice where we are invited to give advice, that's all we do. I do not own any property other than the actual 40 acre property that I purchased eight years ago with my own funds.

We have not received enough donations in order to purchase any property, let alone have a property that we live on that's been donated to us. We have had people offer properties to us, which we have declined, because we believe that it is far better that we use our time sharing with people what we have learnt on our own property rather than having another property to look after. As Mary knows, it's difficult for me to look after my own property, the 40 acres, let alone attempt to look after hundreds of properties around the earth.

However, that all being said, there are many people around the earth who have asked us to be a part of helping them set up what they are wanting to term Learning Centres. This comes from the Constitution of the Gods Way of Love organisation that we've set up, where we have suggested the appropriate way to manage a property, and many of these people want our advice in terms of helping manage these properties, so we give them advice. If they don't want advice anymore we don't give them advice anymore.

They continue to own their own properties whether they take advice from us or not. Obviously if they decide to not take advice from us, we no longer give them advice, and therefore they won't be associated with us in any way. If they desire to take advice from us, which some do, then we will continue to give them advice as long as they desire it, just as we continue to give information to any person as long as that person desires it.

However we do not own these properties and we do not have control of these properties in any way. We do not have financial control of these properties nor do we have direct operational control of the properties. All we do is make suggestions which people are able to choose to follow or not, depending on their desires.

23. Do you hide things from people?

**Mary:** Are you hiding things from people until they become ready to cope with what you say to them?

No, most people would say to me that they do not want to hear from me because they cannot cope with what I'm already saying to them. I don't hide any truth, what I believe to be truth, from any person \- even if later on I've got to change my concept of truth.

If a person asked me today, "What do you believe about such and such a subject?" I will answer them honestly about what I believe about "such and such" a subject. Next week if I've changed my mind and they ask me the same question, I will give them the same answer to which I've changed my mind. I will tell them the truth at the time as I know it - that is what I do.

So yes, I will change my mind depending on how many more things I learn; but I am not in the business of determining what people will decide, or what people will choose to do with that particular information. All I am doing is saying the truth to them; what I believe the truth to be at the time.

I am certainly not hiding things from people until they become ready to learn the truth. I believe quite strongly that we need to share the truth even if other people are not ready for it. I believe quite strongly that it is not my right to choose whether a person is ready, it is not my right to decide for them whether they are ready; they need to decide for themselves whether they are ready or not.

If a person says to me, "Look AJ, I do not want to hear from you about that subject", I say, fine. What subject would you like to discuss then? Or I say, okay, that's a subject I want to discuss, so I'm going - but I do not ever force a subject on a person. My suggestion though is that many people are afraid of hearing truth, and in fact, most of the people who come along to my presentations are afraid of hearing the truth. This is one of the reasons why most people who come to the presentations don't agree with me because they don't agree with what they believe is my version of the truth.

Now I'm just stating to people that I do not believe it's my version of the truth, but that's up to them to decide as well. It is their choice, it's their decision - I do not force them to make a choice or a decision.

24. Are world religions "cults"?

**Mary:** Most people who accuse you of leading a cult, say that the world's religions are not cults, but real religious organisations. What would you like to say about this?

Well firstly, if we look at what I have placed on the Internet under the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about what I believe a cult to be, many of the world's religions would actually come under that definition.

Secondly, I do not believe attacking people and calling things cults is actually the way to address any of those issues. So I feel quite strongly that we need to love every single person on this planet no matter what their religious, cultural, social, sexual or other backgrounds are.

So I personally cannot see how any individual on this planet can attack another individual on the planet without there being some kind of substance to the attack. And even then there is no need to attack, there's just a need to state the truth.

When it comes to the world's religions, it's interesting that many of the current world religions, when they first became established were viewed as cults by the present religions at the time. Yet many of these religions then came to be established religions, and then after that point in time the people then accepted them and therefore no longer called them a cult.

It appears to me that almost any new movement on the planet is treated with suspicion, sometimes initially laughter, then suspicion, then violence, and then acceptance; when we could skip over the laughter, the suspicion and the violence, and go straight to acceptance. I feel that this is what most people on the planet need to do with any new thing that occurs on the planet; we need to go straight to acceptance, we need to say to ourselves, okay, this particular movement, whatever it is, whether it's even evil or not, this particular movement has been created. We need to accept that it's been created, and then we need to ask ourselves questions about what caused its creation.

Now in some cases what has caused its creation is a dissatisfaction with the current particular movements on the planet: so for example, a new political party often gets set up on the planet when there is a dissatisfaction with the old political parties in a certain governmental system; a new religious movement often gets set up on the planet when there is a dissatisfaction with the old religious movements on the planet. Every time someone is dissatisfied with something, generally something new gets created.

I don't believe that is necessarily a negative thing, it is something that is a fact of life that every time there is dissatisfaction, something new generally happens. What I do see as a negative thing is when the new thing that is being created, is created out of violence or its created to perpetrate violence.

These are the things that I would be more concerned about if I were a person examining what I am teaching. What I would be concerned about if I was a listener is this, "Is AJ Miller - who claims to be Jesus - teaching violence, or preaching violence? Is he being abusive? Is he being controlling, manipulative? Is he looking for power? Is he looking for glory? Or is he just stating that he's Jesus, and then stating a heap of other things that he believes to be true also?" They are the questions that you need to ask.

I know what I'm doing: I am just stating what I know to be the truth whether you believe that it's the truth or not, it's up to you - I don't condemn you if you don't - I'm just stating what I know to be the truth. If I don't know it I say that I don't know, which is also something not many other people do.

But if I do know it I will say that I feel I know it, but you don't have to believe me and my suggestion is that you go through your own emotional experience to determine what is truth and what is not. Go through your own experience with God to determine what is God's Love and what is not, go through your own experience with other people to determine what is loving, and what is not.

In your day-to-day life examine through your own experience what is ethical, and what is not. I believe I do know what those things are but I'm also open to being shown that I don't, and if a person is truly humble then they will also be open to that. I feel quite strongly that if we do those particular things we will never need to fear whether there is another religious movement on the planet that is a cult; we will never need to worry about what's happened historically or what's being produced even right now. We will always be examining ourselves to become more loving - that's all we need to do.

So I believe that the world's religious organisations need to do that: what they need to do is examine whether their behaviour is ethical, they need to examine whether their behaviour is loving, they need to examine whether their beliefs about God are loving. They need to examine whether their beliefs about people on Earth - other people who are not a part of their faith - are loving. If they examine these things more carefully and with an open and honest heart, they would automatically know what to do with their belief systems, and their way of life, and the way in which they govern their organisations.

The problem is that most religions on the planet are not doing that. Most religions on the planet have a very fixed opinion of what is true and they are willing to kill other people who disagree, and this is something very much out of harmony with love: it perpetrates more violence on the planet and therefore is far more damaging than anything I have ever taught.

25. Do you believe you are the Messiah?

Yes, I do, of course I do, otherwise I wouldn't be saying that I'm Jesus and in the first century I said I was the Messiah. It depends on what a person believes the Messiah to be. In the first century when I was alive a lot of people believed that the Messiah would be a king, and a person who came to destroy the Roman Empire, and who would come to release the Jews from the captivity of the Romans, and would finish up in some kind of world dominating political power. That's what they believed the Messiah to be.

I knew that that's not what the Messiah is. All a "Messiah" is, is the first person to develop a relationship with God, the way that God intended it to be. They are just the first person who did that, and they are the Messiah in the sense that they can then lead other people into doing the same thing. That's all I chose to do in the first century, and it's all that I've been doing for 2,000 years.

It's interesting today, people believe the Messiah will almost do the same thing as what people believed in the first century: they believed the Messiah would come, Jesus would come, on a throne with all of his angels and destroy the wicked at an event called Armageddon, and would establish a righteous government on Earth as a world power.

Now, the thing they've never questioned is: if I did not do that in the first century, why would I want to do that now? And I don't want to do that now. Being the Messiah is just about being the first person who has ever come into a relationship of at-onement with God - that's all it was and that's all it ever will be for me. It's about the fact that I was the very first person on this planet, to get into that condition; I'm not the only person who has ever been in that condition, I'm only the first person who was in that condition.

I'm referred to as the Messiah because I've helped other people come to that same condition, but I don't believe that that makes me any better than them. All it means is that I have a strong desire for God, and a strong desire for truth, and a strong desire to be humble in my relationship with God, and that enabled me to learn things that other people did not learn because they did not have those same desires.

So that's how I feel I am the Messiah; but I do not believe, and I will not ever accept that I need to be worshipped, that I need to be the king of anything. In fact I feel quite strongly that my God is my King, and my God, my Creator is the person if I'm going to worship, that would be the person I would worship. In fact I recommend to people to not have anything more to do with worshipping me because if they do, they'll be severely disappointed.

26. Do you have direct authority from God?

**Mary:** Do you believe you have direct authority from God that puts you above other people?

No I don't believe I have direct authority from God that puts me above other people. I believe that God and myself are in a relationship and every other child of God is able to have exactly the same kind of relationship with God. In other words from God's perspective we are all equal; we are all equal in worth and value.

However there are some people who have received more of God's Love than other people. The reason why this is the case is because those people who've received more love wanted to have more love: because of their desire for more love, God gave them more love - they had to firstly exercise that desire. I have exercised the desire to receive love from God – it has been my primary motive and intention all of my life. As a result of that I have received a lot of love from God as a direct result of my desire. Every other person on the planet can receive the same amount of love from God as what I have received. And every other person on the planet can receive the same amount of truth that I have received; they can, but the question is, will they. They will only be able to do it if they desire it. That's what I am teaching.

So I don't believe I have any direct authority from God: God is the person in authority, God is the person that defined all of God's Laws, God is the person that put all of these Laws into action. I live under every one of God's Laws just like every other person that God has ever created lives under every one of God's Laws. God is the Law Maker and the Law Giver and I am the law abider, so I don't believe I have any more authority than any other person.

Of course if I have received Love from God, I do understand a lot about love and I believe many people on the planet need to learn a lot about love because there is not much love on the planet and this is one of the reasons why I'm here is to share what I believe about love, with other people, if they want to hear it. I don't believe that that places me in a place of authority, it places me in a place where I desire to share what I know and that's what I am doing – sharing what I know.

Now in the spirit world when I was living in the spirit world I did have some authority in the sense, because I was one of the most loving persons in the spirit world and other people would listen to me because they wanted to become more loving themselves. That is the only way in which I have any authority is the way in which people are willing to listen – if they want to – to anything I say because they believe personally that I have more of an understanding of love than they do.

Now a lot of people on this planet don't believe that and that's fine by me - they don't have to believe that - but there are some people on the planet who do believe that I know more about love than they do and so they listen to what I say about love and then they try, or attempt to practice it. I don't believe that places me in a position of authority but rather places me in a position where I am able to share what I have learned with other people and that's what I love doing.

27. Do you believe that you are better than other people?

No, I do not believe that I am better than other people, and in fact, if I did believe I was better than other people I don't think that Mary would actually live with me. The reality is that I believe that I'm the same as other people, I do not believe I am worse than other people, I believe that I am the same as other people. I believe I have the same worthiness in God's eyes as every other person who God has ever created. I believe that I am just as worthy as the most powerful person on the planet; I believe that I am just as worthy as the most destitute person on the planet, I believe they have as much worth as I do.

In terms of my personal opinion about my worth, I feel that we are all equal and I believe that in my heart. This is why I treat other people with the same respect as what I expect to be treated with myself; that's why I am ethical in my relationships with others. That's why I practice what I preach when I come to treating other people in the way in which I would like to be treated, because I believe that everyone has the same worth and everyone deserves to be treated in the same way.

28. Do you allow people to question you?

(Laughs) Well, if anybody watched my seminars they wouldn't ask that question because the reality is that most people who come to my seminars question me constantly. So yes, of course I allow people to question me; I don't allow people to treat me badly while they are questioning me. I feel there's a difference between allowing someone to ask you a question, and someone who is asking you a question in order to attack you. I don't believe that I need to be attacked in any way, and I wouldn't attack another person if I was asking them questions. So I feel that people are allowed to ask questions so long as their questions are stated with a loving attitude.

That being said, there have been many times in my seminars when people haven't stated their questions in a loving way and I've still answered them. I do believe however that it's important for us all to start questioning with a more open attitude. What I notice happening a lot in my seminars is that people ask a question when really they want to make a statement. What I mean by that is, they couch a question when really they just want to make a statement about me, to me and I don't believe this is a very valid form of questioning. If a person is truly sincere they will ask a question without attempting to make statements.

If we want to have a conversation, then make some statements. That's fine by me, but make the statements rather than trying to turn them into questions. Make the statements, what do you believe? You can say to me, "I don't believe you are Jesus", and I'll go, "Fine, that's okay, can we move on?" If a person says, "Are you Jesus?" oftentimes they are not making a question "are you Jesus", because I've already told them that I am. They are actually making a statement that they don't believe I am and so what I'm trying to do is say to them, "Well, you can make the statement that you do not believe I am Jesus and I'm perfectly happy to accept your statement but that's not a question. If you're asking me whether I am saying I am Jesus, certainly I am. That is a question and I'll answer the question, yes."

But when people couch their comments as questions, when really they want to make statements, then I will actually look at their underlying emotional issues or reasons as to why they want to do that, with them in an open forum. Many people become quite afraid of that. So in other words, if a person came to me and said, "Are you Jesus?" when they've heard me say many times to them that I am, then I would say to them, "Why are you asking me this question again? What emotion in you is causing you to ask this question in the way in which you have? Because I've already answered the question, I don't need to answer it again, I've already stated quite clearly what the answer is."

My suggestion is that if you come along to a seminar, come prepared to ask sincere questions and I will come prepared to give you a sincere answer about what I believe to be true. You do not have to believe me but you definitely need to treat me with some respect while you're asking me the question, because if you don't then I'll ask you to leave my seminar - I'm paying for your seat, and I'm paying for the venue, and I'm spending my time with you for free - you definitely need to treat me with some respect. If you don't, don't come because if you come with that attitude I will send you home, and if you don't go home I will call the police in fact.

Because I actually have a feeling of my own worth - that I feel I am worth as much as you are - and therefore I don't deserve to the attacked, just like you don't deserve to be attacked. So don't come to my seminars if you expect to attack me; come to my seminars if you want to sincerely ask some questions that you would like to have answered; or come to my seminars on certain subjects because you would like to know more about that particular subject. That's my suggestion.

29. When will you not allow people to question you?

There are times when I will definitely not allow people to question me: the first time that I will not allow people to question me is when a person is treating me in a condescending, belittling or attacking manner. I don't see any reason why I should answer such questions, I don't see any reason why I should even give those people - who want to attack me - my time. My time is a gift and, my time is worth as much as anybody else's time. So if you come along to any of my seminars, or question me in any way in an attacking manner, I don't feel that I have to answer you - I may answer you but I don't feel that I have to answer you - under those circumstances it is highly likely that I possibly will not answer you.

If you decide to, to ask me questions in a condescending and belittling manner, then it's highly likely that I will eventually terminate the conversation and not answer your questions. The reason why is because I have some self-esteem. It might not be enough yet to actually attract everyone treating me in a respectful manner, but it's certainly enough for me to recognise when someone isn't treating me with any respect. And why would I wish to give my time as a gift to somebody who doesn't treat me with any respect? Now this applies whether you are a member of the media or any other person.

If you come along asking questions in a belittling or attacking manner then the conversation will be terminated and, you can go on your way because I do not want to engage with you under those circumstances.

I will only engage with you if you're willing to treat me in the manner in which I am willing to treat you, and that is with respect. I am willing to answer any question, but I'm not willing to answer any attack. I'm not willing to be belittled. I'm not willing to be condescended to, and I'm not willing to be laughed at. I am willing to answer any question that is done from a sincere heart, from a sincere desire to know the truth of the answer.

So if you are any member of the public, or any member of the media who wishes to come and ask me questions in that way, I am perfectly happy to answer any of those questions. However, don't expect that you can come along and ask me questions in any of the manners that I have illustrated and not have the conversation terminated because I definitely will terminate a conversation that I feel is out of harmony with love of myself.

30. Do you believe that you are the only source of Truth on the planet?

I believe the only source of truth is God - that's what I believe. I also believe that any single individual on this planet, or in the spirit world - who are obviously still alive even though people on Earth believe they're dead - any single one of those people is able to receive direct information from God about any answer they wish to ask about, any question they wish to ask about. So I actually feel that any single person who is God's child has the ability to connect to God directly and to receive information from God about any question.

Of course, if two different people connect to God and claim they are connecting to God, then if God's giving them the answer, the answer will be identical. This whole concept that God will give different answers to different people is flawed in its logic.

The issue we face though is how many people are actually connecting to God and getting direct answers from God on the truth of different subjects? My feelings are that very few people are actually doing that and this is evidenced by how many religions there are being practiced on the planet. I think there are seven or eight thousand religions currently on the planet, and this is an indication that there are seven or eight thousand groups of people who are in direct disharmony with God, because if they were in direct harmony with God they would all have the same concept of love, and the same belief systems about the truth.

See, I believe that God has Absolute Truth and when we come to accept God's Truth in our heart through a process where we connect with God individually, we finish up having the same opinion on the same issue with regard to truth. It doesn't mean that we have the same personality, and it doesn't mean we have the same expression of our personality, and it doesn't mean we have the same desires.

But it just means that if you ask a question such as, "Is there a spirit world?" the answer of all of the people who are connecting with God will be identical. The fact that it's not identical on this planet at this point in time indicates that the majority of people who claim that they are connecting with God, are not connecting with God, but rather either they're connecting with someone else, or just with their own ideas.

I am not doing that - now you don't have to believe that - I am just stating that's not what I've done. What I am trying to do before I share truth with others, is I'm trying to discover the truth myself through this connection with God. I am willing to be wrong and I'm willing to change, however, I am also going to be a person who is sincere about that particular process. Because I am so sincere about that particular process, the truth is that I have a lot of truth that this planet has never seen before that I can share with different people on this planet. But I am not the only one who is able to discover it; any person is able to discover it if they are willing to go through the same process that God showed me I had to go through in order to discover it.

So while I believe all of us are capable of receiving truth in the same manner from God, I do not believe all of us are receiving truth in the same manner from God and that is because we are unwilling to accept God's method of receiving that particular information. What I'm attempting to show people is that I believe I have discovered God's method two thousand years ago, and I'm attempting to share that method with people. If they try that same method then God will be able to share with them, truth - just as God has shared with me, truth. I am not the only person who can receive this truth because every single one of God's children has the ability to receive this truth. It's just whether we are open to receiving it or not, as to whether we do and this is where I feel the main problem is. Most people on the planet are not open to receiving God's Truth; they are only open to receiving their own ideas reflected back at themselves, and that's why there is very little truth on the planet.

31. Do you attempt to cut people off from their family and friends?

Definitely not, I believe very strongly that there is no need to cut people off from anything that is currently attracted to their life because they have attracted these people into their life and they need to interact with them in order to work through specific things that they need to personally work through in order to grow in their own soul. What happens often though is that people who come along to my seminars report to me that often their families start attacking them for coming along to my seminars. Now obviously if you as a family start attacking an individual in your family, that individual is going to feel cut off from their family, and that individual is probably not going to want to associate with people who attack them all the time. So that individual will probably withdraw from the family.

My suggestion is, if a family member believes that I have somehow caused another one of their family to no longer speak to them, my suggestion is for that family member to examine their own personal behaviour towards the family member who has left them and work out what has been unloving in the interaction. That's what I would suggest to the person. Obviously, if somebody treats us badly we are not going to want to spend time with them, and just because you define something as bad it doesn't mean that the other person in your family finds it as bad and just because you define something as good, it doesn't mean that the other person in the family defines it as good.

In addition, I feel quite strongly that every single person must have their free will honoured: in other words, every single person on this planet has the ability, and should be given the freedom to make their own choice and the only time that should ever be restricted is when the person's choice is unloving and can be demonstrated to be unloving. Now many people when they start embracing any area of personal development, and in particular when they start embracing personal development in love, often change and this often causes members of their family or their friends to become concerned. But change is inevitable if somebody is going to grow and I believe we need to look quite strongly at why a person feels that they have to leave us in order to change. This is an indication that we are placing restrictions on them, not allowing them to change.

So if I were a person who was concerned, what I would be doing is firstly looking at myself and going, "Is my treatment of my family member or friend \- who has left me - has my treatment been loving? Or have I been pushy and demanding, and yelling and screaming and telling them they had to do what I'm suggesting and browbeating them all the time, and manipulating them all the time and trying to get some cult expert in to fix them, or whatever it is that I've been doing that is out of harmony with the free will of the individual?" Because if you do those particular things undoubtedly the other person is going to leave your life because they are not going to enjoy that attack.

My suggestion is that if you desire to attack a person in such a way, look at your own unloving emotions and your own fears because obviously your fears are causing you to act in an unloving manner and you need to adjust your actions.

32. If families are concerned about their loved ones being involved with you, what would you say to them?

My suggestion to those families would be to come along to a seminar, or two, at least and examine what actually does happen at the seminars. You don't have to come along to listen to the information, come along and just examine what happens at the seminars. Come along and spend some time with your friend or your family member, and spend some time not in concern for them, not trying to push them into doing something that you want them to do, but spend some time in their life and just see how they live their life. You will see that the majority of the people you are concerned of have no day-to-day interaction with me at all. The reason why this is the case, is that Mary and I spend most of our time sharing information in public, either in interview situation, or in a seminar situation, or in groups, and we spend very little of our time with individuals because we have very little time left over from spending our time in public, to share time with individuals.

You do not need to be concerned for your family or your friends because you can easily just come along and see what they are doing at any point in time and you would see that what they are doing is very, very innocent in the sense that it's all about developing in love, truth and humility. Now if your family member is emotional, then what do you expect? They are growing, they are going to be emotional through the process of growth. I'm encouraging people to become like a child with the expression of their emotion: in other words, to honour their emotion at every point in time, in their experience. If you're confronted by that, then my suggestion is to look at why you are confronted by that because there is no need to control the person with their emotion. Why do you want to control their emotion? Why do you believe their emotion should be controlled? These are all things I believe a family member needs to look at.

So my suggestion is, come along to a few seminars. You will see how innocently everything is run, how very open and straightforward they are. If you examine the seven hundred hours of YouTube seminars you will see that every one of them is run pretty much the same way. There is no editing, everything you see is exactly what you get. There is no subterfuge, there is no deceit, there is nothing to be concerned about.

But the best way for you to find that out is by not listening to media reports, and not listening to internet forums of people who've never spoken to me, or have spoken to me for a few hours five years ago, but rather people who interact with me on a day-to-day basis. And you can be one of those people who interact with me on a day-to-day basis and find out if there are any problems with me, and I'm pretty sure as I am pretty sure with most people who meet me - they feel like there is no problem. It's only people who listen to media reports that are false, that are lie based reports, that are going to feel there's any kind of a problem.

33. Do you try to stop other people being influenced by their friends, families, or the public generally?

No, the reality is that I believe that every single person on this planet is influenced by somebody - most of us are influenced by the media. Many times we are lied to and we are influenced by the lies. In a family situation - many times we are influenced by other members of the family - they make a suggestion and often we follow it when we wouldn't have followed it if they didn't make the suggestion. That is influence, the reality is we are unable to avoid influence from any single person on this planet.

In terms of my own influence over others, all I do is I share what I believe to be the truth with any person who asks me what I believe the truth to be. That's all I do, that's the only level of influence I have over any other person, which actually is the same level of influence that any other person on this planet has over another person. I do not manipulate or control; I speak openly about the truth. I state it openly and straight forward; I do not bend it or manipulate it to suit myself and so therefore there is no other form of influence that a person can receive from me. All I am going to do is state the truth as I believe it to be and leave it open for you to decide. That's all I'm going to do; that's the entire level of influence I have over any individual.

34. What do you feel about people examining other beliefs?

**Mary:** If you found out that someone attending your seminars was examining other literature or belief systems, what would you do?

I would celebrate their choice to exercise their free will to gain more knowledge, I believe that this is a very essential part of investigating any truth. We need to be able to be free to investigate knowledge that comes from any source and test it through our own experience - we need to be free to do that.

Any religion, or any organisation that prevents that from occurring, I feel is "cult like" in their behaviour. Mary and I do not prevent people from examining more truth from any source, in fact, we encourage it: we have encouraged people to go to different religions if there were one. We have even encouraged people who have been sceptical of Christianity to go and visit some of the churches to get to know some of the people, and they will see that the people are not as "bad" as what they think.

So we have encouraged people constantly to examine every issue for more truth. We certainly do not excommunicate them for finding out some more truth, we don't try to prevent them from finding out more truth. We don't even prevent them from going on internet forums that are attacking towards myself and Mary. We don't even make the suggestion that they should not go. Many people go for whatever reasons they have. We don't know, and I don't know why they want to do it, but they do and that's fine too. Maybe they have lots of doubts about us and they like these forums because it sort of helps them through some of their doubts. That does not matter to me.

All that matters is that I want to present information that I believe to be the truth to any person who has a desire to hear it; I don't want to present it to any person who does not have a desire to hear it; I do not want to manipulate any person into listening just to me and no-one else. I want people to discover as much truth as they possibly can by listening to as many people as they possibly can, and then working through their own experience of that particular information.

35. Do you filter information given to members?

**Mary:** Many cults filter information to their members. How do you filter information given to your group?

I do not filter any information given to the group. I share with every single person any information that they are willing to ask a question about. I do not have any level of control over any single person in any of the groups. In fact, I do not even have a group. They are just people who come along to seminars that we organise. Some of the people are the same people who came along to the last seminar because they liked what they heard the last time they came along. But we don't have a group of people: there are many people who come in, listen for a while then go away; there are many people who have only heard me once in a seminar; there are many people who have only heard me present information on the internet through YouTube; there are many people who have only heard information in audio form.

That's because I don't control how anybody does anything. What I wanted to do, all I want to do, is present what I believe to be the truth to people and give them the opportunity to hear it. That's all that we are doing. We do nothing else. We do not filter information, we do not prevent people from discovering information for themselves. We do not tell them they should not discover other information, and we do not prevent them from reading other books and other material. In fact we encourage them to do so. We want people to have as much information at their fingertips as they possibly can have, in order for them to make the most wise decisions for their own life that they can.

36. Why are people careful about what they say to you?

**Mary:** Some people around you feel they have to be careful about what they say and do. Why do they feel that is if you are not a cult leader?

Why do people have to be careful about what they say and do around me? Well, I don't know why people feel they have to be careful about what they say and do around me, because I'm not careful about what I say and do around them. I encourage everybody to just be open and truthful with me about what I'm saying and doing. However I do understand at times that people become afraid of hearing the truth under certain circumstances. I am a person who is willing to state exactly what I feel at all times with every single individual that I interact with.

Now most people who interact with me - after a certain period of time - they go through this period where they start feeling like, "What's he going to say next? What's the next thing that's going to be challenged? What's the next truth that he's going to tell me that he believes?" And so what they do then is they start being a bit afraid, like they start going, "Well, do I want to go up and speak to him, or don't I?" Like, "If I go to speak with him what will he tell me about myself that I don't want to hear? I might get angry with him and how is he going to act then?"

And they start questioning their own behaviour with me and as a result they become afraid in their interactions with me but that's their own emotional stuff - I don't see it as my issue. All I see it is that I am willing to state the truth, and to be open and honest in every interaction with every single person, every single time I could possibly be. I attempt to do that with as much kindness as I can muster because I feel a feeling of love towards the people who I'm stating the truth to.

If a person comes up and asks me a question I will state what I believe to be the answer at the time. If I believe they don't want to know the answer, I will say. "I don't believe you want to know the answer." Many people find that confronting and so some people become afraid of me as a result. I don't feel there is any need to be afraid of me, as Mary and other people who know me more intimately know I'm just really like a cuddly teddy bear who has a lot of love for people, but who is just different in this one aspect and that is that I'm willing to state the truth in every interaction.

So I believe for the majority of people the main reason they are afraid of me, if they are afraid of me - and I suggest to you that the majority aren't - that any person who is afraid of me is primarily afraid of me because they're just afraid of what they might hear from me. If that's the case my suggestion is, don't have an interaction with me then. I'm perfectly okay to not say anything and just feel my love for the person rather than saying anything. I don't feel the need that I have to share any information with a person unless they ask. So my feelings are, address the emotional issue of fear, and then we can have a decent, straightforward interaction.

37. Do you ask members hide their true thoughts & feelings?

**Mary:** People in cults are generally asked to hide their true thoughts and feelings. Do you ask this of your members?

Definitely not, and by the way there are no members and I must clarify that first, there is no membership of anything, we don't have any members, we don't have any followers, we don't have any group, we don't have any organised thing whatsoever. All Mary and I do is organise seminars, workshops, different events where we share information with people, that's all we do. Now at these particular events, we share lots and lots of different information and a lot of this information is sometimes information that we love to share with people, and sometimes its information that people have questioned us upon. That is the primary source of the information.

What we do encourage at each event is that people are openly honest and truthful with us about everything they think and feel, that's what we strongly encourage; we actually strongly encourage everybody to do that with each other as well as us. We feel that this is the only way to become real, the only way to become actually connected with yourself is to honour your own viewpoints and opinions, and honour your own feelings. And to do this you must state what you feel in every situation, and state what you think. I am perfectly content to have a person state to me, "I think you're an idiot AJ." I'm okay with that. I'll go, "Okay, that's your opinion and you're entitled to your opinion." I'm not okay with them condescendingly treating me because they think I'm an idiot, because that is an act of love, or lack of love and I feel that I'm worth just as much as they are in order to be treated lovingly.

But I'm perfectly happy for people to state their opinion and in fact, I desire people to state their opinions more and more. I want people to be open with their opinion because if they were more open with their opinions they would understand more about what they believe, they would understand more about why they feel what they feel emotionally, and why they feel their feelings support their thinking, their belief systems. They would understand their logical, and illogical, reasoning systems if they stated what they thought a bit more and if they stated what they felt more. So we strongly encourage people to state what they feel and what they think, and there is evidence of that all the way through the presentations that we have recorded.

38. Are you Divinely inspired (revelations, visions etc)?

**Mary:** Many cults believe their leaders are divinely inspired. Do you feel you are given supernatural revelations, visions and so on?

I do not believe I have been given supernatural visions, revelations and so on; I believe however that I can be divinely inspired. The reason why I feel that is because, if I am connected to God and in a relationship with God, then God can share information with me. I do not believe that I am the only person on the planet who is capable of entering this condition because I believe that every single child of God is capable of a relationship with God where God shares the truth with them. So I believe that every person on the planet is capable of being divinely inspired.

Supernatural visions and other types of things are all generally given by spirits, and I do not have these kind of connections with spirits and so I do not have visions and other things like that. I have memories about my life that I am sharing with people, memories about what I've discovered about Divine Truth, memories about what I've discovered about God's Love, memories about what I've discovered about how to connect with God. These are the things that I'm sharing with people. I do not believe that I'm the only person who is capable of being divinely inspired; I feel every single person who desires a loving connection with God will eventually become divinely inspired.

39. Do you punish people who don't follow your teachings?

**Mary:** Many cults punish people who do not conform. Do you punish people who do not follow you or your teachings?

I definitely do not punish people who do not follow my teachings or follow me - I don't want anybody really to follow me. I would love people to follow my teachings if they want to, but I don't punish them if they don't. There are many people who come along to my seminars and who've been coming for four or five years who I know every single day of their lives they don't follow what I teach, and yet they still come to my seminars and I still interact with them as individuals. There are many people who have never even come to one of my seminars that I have spent a lot of time with, and there are many workmen who visit our property, there are many other people that we interact with on a day-to-day basis, and I do not have that kind of relationship with them.

I do not desire to punish anyone for anything they do, even if they harm me; however, I do desire to withdraw from people who treat me badly. So if a person is regularly angry with me, or a person is regularly attacking of me, then I would decide to not spend much time in their company, because I have a feeling of more love for myself than they feel for me at the time. Now if a person is willing to treat me in a negative and unloving manner, then I feel they do not love me enough for me to continue an interaction with them. However if they continued to ask me questions about different matters in a respectful manner, I would continue to answer their questions in a public forum. However in my private life, I am only going to associate with people who have some level of respect and love for me, just as I would only expect other people to have me in their life if I had some respect and love for them.

40. Do you give personal advice to people?

Yes, I occasionally do give personal advice to people. When I say occasionally, the main reason why it is only occasionally is because we do not have the time, Mary and I do not have the time to give advice to people individually all the time. We have a lot more public interactions, or interactions with larger groups of people than we do with private interaction. In addition, because we have public interactions we prefer to give advice only to people who are willing to also have that advice recorded so that we can share it with others and many people refuse to do that of course, and so we cannot give them advice. There are people who decide that they love to share the information that we're sharing with them with others, and under those circumstances we are willing to provide them with advice as long as that advice can also be placed on the internet in a public forum so that any other person asking us a similar question can listen to the conversation.

We are willing to give advice but I'm certainly not desirous of the person following my advice. In other words, I have no demands upon the person following my advice. They are able to follow it or not depending on what they believe. If they wish to have a personal interaction with me then at some point they're going to have to follow the advice. Because the advice would always be based around something that's loving - or a lack of love not being present - and of course if a lack of love is not being present in the way they treat myself, then if they don't follow my advice then I can't spend more time with them. It's as simple as that. However if the advice is about something where they are treating, how they are treating someone else, or what they are doing in their personal life, then I have no business to control their life and I will continue providing advice as much as they want it.

I am not going to provide advice about what a person can do medically, and I am not going to provide advice about what a person should do with their partner, for example, unless their partner is present. There are certain stipulations that I have on providing advice because I believe many people take advice out of context. When Mary and I provide advice we normally record every single piece of advice we give. The reason why we do that is if the person misrepresents our advice we can go back to the recording and show them how they are misrepresenting the advice that we have given. We actually suggest that each person who takes our advice or wants it, also records - for them selves - the advice itself. The reason why we suggest that is because we have found in the past that many people believe we have said things that we haven't actually said in our conversations with them. And when they have re-listened to the recordings, they realise that their belief was based around their own emotional response to what we said, rather than what we actually said.

So my suggestion is that anyone who wants personal advice, understands that it's very hard for us to give personal advice unless it's going to benefit lots and lots of people. The reason why is that if we gave personal advice to every person we knew, we would have no life ourselves, we would have no time to do the things we enjoy, and we would have no time to share truth publicly. So our focus is sharing truth publicly, and if you're willing to have your piece of advice shared publicly, then we are willing to provide advice under those circumstances, given our time and our circumstances depending on our desires.

41. Do you tell people what to believe?

Definitely not, what I tell people is what I believe, and then I get them to question what they believe, through what I believe. Now they don't have to do what I believe, or practice what I believe, or tell others what I believe, or any of those things. If a person comes to ask me a question about what I believe, I will tell them the truth about what I believe.

I do not expect them to accept the belief - that is up to them and that is up to their personal experience - and in fact, in my experience the majority of people do not accept what I believe until they go through their own personal experiences and then they come to believe similar things to what I believe, as a result. I actually feel that every person who connects to God directly, and actually connects to God through this personal experience, will eventually come to believe very similar things to what I currently believe.

But I don't feel there is any need for them to do so; I don't feel they must do so in order to have an interaction with me, and I don't feel that I can force them into believing anything. In fact, if I tried to force them into believing anything, I would be out of harmony with my own teachings because my own teachings demonstrate free will at all times - respect for free will at all times - and so if I do not respect another person's free will I am automatically out of harmony with my own teachings and that would make me a hypocrite. So my suggestion to people is that if they come and ask me a question, expect me to say exactly what I think.

But also, do not expect that I am trying to get them to believe exactly what I think. Just because I state what I think with a definite assurance, and just because I state it categorically, it doesn't mean that I expect the other person must accept what I'm saying. But I will say things with conviction when I'm firmly convinced and, I obviously will come up with many logical arguments as a result of those convictions. If my arguments are illogical, then tell me that they are illogical and we can have a discussion. That's what I believe every person needs to do in any interaction with any person, let alone any interaction with myself.
