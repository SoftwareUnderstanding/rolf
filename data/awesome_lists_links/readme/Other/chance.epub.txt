Chapter 1

I just don't know how to convince the guys to stay home and watch football on a Saturday night instead of going to Kissandra's party. Kiss throws some good parties, big ones. She's the only good friend we are in contact with after college. But these days I just want to lock myself in this penthouse, thinking of Her. Does she think of me like how I do of her? It has been many nights since I haven't slept well. Trying to figure out how she cheated on me with a douchebag. She's been the only first girl I have given much interest to.

A hard bump on the door snatches me from my thoughts. "Yo, open up the door, we're late to the party," I hear Isaac's voice from the closed door. I drag myself up from the couch and open the door, "dude you're still not dressed yet!" Joseph says with his sleek navy suit jacket, with a white shirt under and glossy black hair combed to the back. "I can't figure out what has got into you these past few weeks," Isaac says walking into the penthouse with his black longline muscle t-shirt and a strong scented perfume, "he's right, you've been weird," Joseph follows. I haven't told them about Her. I just realized how distant I've become from the guys. She occupied most of my time. "Guys, I'm just worn out today. Had a long day," I see them eyeing me with disbelief, "what?" I ask, "dude you're not right up here," Joseph says poking my head with his finger, "get freaking dressed, we got only 15 minutes," Isaac adds looking at his Rolex watch. It's like there is no room for convincing. I sigh inwards heading to the bedroom.

Here we are, Kissandra's party. The people jammed up as always. Barely room to even walk. I can smell the alcohol from the entrance, and the blasting music. Kiss comes right up to us with her usual smile.

"Well hello gentlemen," she says giving each one of us a warming hug. It's been long since I saw her. She smells good as always. "Been long I haven't seen you around," she says in my ear while hugging me. I can smell the liquor from her, as I give her a warm smile rubbing off what she said, as I always do. "Where the alcohol at?" asks Isaac in a high-pitched voice over the music. Kiss points to the kitchen and Isaac starts to lead as we follow, when I feel a strong grip on my arm. I see Kiss dragging me to the corner and on a couch, making me sit so she sits on top of me. "Why you so arrogant? Trying to push me away?" She whispers in my ear, "Kiss, I think you're drunk!" I reply, "don't change the subject, answer me," she insists. It's not her first time doing this. I've told her I wasn't interested in being more than friends and how much I valued our friendship, but she never listened. "Kiss!!" Shouts someone from deep in the crowd, saving me from the torture. She looks at the crowd and suddenly gets up and dances into the dancefloor. I decide to let myself loose, so I head to the guys. I see Joseph wrapped up with a girl in the corner, so I head to the drinks and get one. Isaac is nowhere to be found, as always. I pour myself some beer and head over to the patio. As I get past the crowded dancefloor and head to the little crowd on the hallway which leads to the patio. I come to a halt as I couldn't believe my eyes, I see Her. What is she doing here?! How does she know Kiss? She looks more beautiful than usual. Or it might be because I haven't seen her in a while, which felt like years. She has a red, silky dress hugging her model-like body, which matches her red lipstick, her glossy brown hair reaching below her chest. I miss her. She looks sexy as hell leaning back on the beautifully designed wall, laughing while playing with her hair. I see she has a guy talking to her, mouth to mouth. Might be the guy whom she came with, maybe she doesn't know Kiss, well I hope she doesn't. Or might be the douchebag whom she cheated on me with, or maybe a new toy to play with. She doesn't notice me; I don't want her to. Anger starts to surface me as I head to the patio, ducking my head down, pretending to look at my Armani watch.

I feel the cool breeze icing my anger down. I still can't believe I saw her. She looked happy and unbothered by me. Would she be as surprised if she has seen me too? I sit on the empty wide seating swing and take a good sip of my beer, and lay my head up, relaxing with my eyes closed. I need to get over this. I feel a little pressure on the swing, so I glance down and I see a smoking hot blondie beside me. I might want her for tonight. "Hey handsome, how come you alone?" She asks with a half-smile, "waiting for you," I reply, which makes her smile grow wider, and her green eyes glisten under the dimmed lights, "that's why I came as fast as I could," she says. She comes closer, closing the gap between us and grabs the back of my head, pulling me closer into her and pours her hot kiss to me. I kiss her back, hard. God, it's good to be back.

I enjoy the first five minutes of it, when suddenly I hear Joseph in my ear saying, "dude I'm sorry, but we got to get going. It's Isaac again," I pop my eyes up removing myself from the beautiful blondie whose name was Sara, or maybe Mary. I get on my feet and start moving as Joseph follows saying, "sorry beautiful." I get to the hallway; I see no sight of Her. A bit of relief fills me. I see Isaac on the dancefloor, drunk dancing with a girl, making a fool out of himself with his dance moves. I guess some things will never change. I guess I'll be sleeping alone tonight, again. We head to Isaac and the girl, and Joseph blocks the girl and whispers to Isaac, probably saying we're leaving. As I excuse ourselves, apologizing to the girl. Joseph carries Isaac and heads for the door. I stop to take a quick glance at the crowd, to see her for one last time, but I don't. As I turn to head to the door, I see this lady. Never seen her before, might be new. I stare at her, as she sways her beautifully-curved body, with a huge smile on her face, showing off her dimples. Her face looks soft and serene, much like an innocent infant. She looks gorgeous with the short velvet black dress tight to her curvy body, flipping her dark hair to the side. I can feel her confidence vibing in the air. I see her dancing with two other ladies, probably her friends. There's an urge in me to go to her. An unfamiliar feeling.

"Abel, let's go!" Joseph yells loud from the front door. I jog to the door, head out to the white Range Rover Hybrid and sit in the passenger seat. "What were you staring at?" Asks Joseph switching on the ignition, "nothing man, thought I saw somebody I know," I reply, and look at the sleeping beauty in the back seat, "sleeping already?!" I ask to lose the thread, "as always," he replies. I keep thinking about the curvy girl on the way home. I've never went up to any girl my whole life. The guys set me up on dates just for fun, or the girls make the move. I've not even went up and talked to Her. She is special, or maybe was, but I didn't make the first move with her either. This feeling in me is something I can't recognize.

I never thought I'd see Her again. She looked good. Does she sleep well at night? Or is she like me? Does she miss me as I do her? Does she have a little love inside her heart for me?

Joseph grabs my attention, "dude you okay?" he asks, "yeah, why do you ask?" I ask him with puzzlement, "I've known you for about ten years now. You've been acting weird. Very distant," he says. Joseph is the calm guy from us. He always reads us when we act differently. We got some things in common. We're both serious and sophisticated, tall in height with black hair and well-built. But Isaac is the opposite of us. He is bald and bulky, funny, a little shorter than us and has a huge enthusiasm which gives a joyful spirit to our friendship. We've known each other since college and now we're here, from bad boys of college to men with five figure jobs. "Nah man, I was just busy with work stuff. I'm done with it now," I try to shut down the subject. I don't want to discuss Her with them. She'll be my secret I'll never forget. I open the door to the penthouse, feeling tired after so long. I head to the bedroom, dump my clothes and get to bed.

I see her curvy body in a foggy display. I see her with the huge smile on her face, looking at me while pulling some strands of dark hair to the side. The same feeling erupts in me again, the urge to go to her, but something holds me back. She starts to fade away, I want to catch her, make her stay, but I feel like my arms are tied up. She fades into the air as I shout, "NO" to her.

I abruptly wake up with a beating heart that I feel coming out of my chest. I turn around to see the clock on the nightstand, with a confused face and irritation for waking up in the darkness. It's four a.m., only had two hours sleep. I didn't sleep well most nights in the last few weeks, but definitely no nightmare. It's just because I was thinking about her last night. I'm sure it's just a big temptation. I roll my back to bed and fasten my eyes to sleep.

Boredom strikes as I sit at my office with my green tea. I've done most of my paper works the past few weeks, because I thought it would help me forget about Her, but it didn't. And now I'm left with no work to do, which pushes me to remember the paradise, which lasted for only four months. Her touch, kiss, words that filled my heart were like my great escape from the real life. It's been two months since I went up to her house in the middle of the night, with red roses, wine and pizza, to surprise her after she told me she had an exhausting long day. Oh, how I had that night planned out for her. I had a spare key to her apartment and so did she. I remember I was bursting with excitement just to see her in shock, and see what she would say. I open the door and see the apartment in dimmed lights, and candles all over the tables and on kitchen counter. I remember her saying how she likes to switch up some music, light up some candles and drink wine whenever she has a long day. Maybe I came in the right time. I feel a grin growing in my face. "Oh God," a deep voice from the small hallway comes out, making my eyes immediately pop out. No, she can't do this. I don't believe my ears, so I force my foot to walk into the hallway. I hear gasps just outside the left room in the hallway, which is her bedroom. She can't possibly be doing this. I grab the door handle and take a deep breath, open the door and see her. I see her in a situation I wish I can forget.

A soft knock on the door takes me out of my thoughts, "come in," I order. The door cracks open and I see Helen's head poking in, "Mr. Dashwood is here for his appointment, sir," Helen is my secretary. You can say she is the best decision I've made so far, "let him in," I say.

Chapter 2

I park my black and shiny Buick Avista and head to the elevators, as I receive a text message, 'game at your crib, 8pm,' from Isaac. I forgot about the game tonight. I really need to get myself right.

"I can't believe they lost at just one point," shouts Isaac, "as always," replies Joseph, "shut up dude," he fires back, which makes me laugh as I take a sip of the beer, "girls" I say. The table is messed up with crumbs of chips and empty beer bottles, "guys, I was thinking," Isaac starts, "why don't we throw a big ass party, just like the old times!" He says. "I think the beer just kicked in," says Joseph and we laugh at the comment, "c'mon guys, don't you miss that life?!" Isaac asks with no bone of laughter, "I know I do," I reply with my finger raised in the air, "but we're too old to throw parties dude," Joseph comments, "let's just do it one last time, for old times' sake!" insists Isaac. "I don't know man," says Joseph unconfidently, "I think it's a great idea," I say, "that's the spirit," Isaac claps with a goofy smile on his face. "Two against one," Joseph says defeated, "Saturday night at nine, I know a place," Isaac claims as if he knew we'd agree. I have to force myself out of this misery I hate to see myself in. I need to forget Her. And this sounds like a good plan to start.

I spend the entire four days at the office. Architecture has always been my dream. And I have been blessed to make my dream come true. I built this business and it has been going successfully as I work hard day and night for it. It's not a big company yet, but my plans will be changing that.

I feel a lack of excitement, as I spray Sauvage on my white, slim fit, long sleeve shirt, and put blue jeans on and Sukun Canvas shoes. As I gel my hair up, my phone beeps a message. I receive the address of the place from Isaac. I head to the car and start the ignition and type the address in the sat nav device, as my phone rings. "Hey mom," I answer, "hi darling, how are you?" She greets, "I'm good mom, how's dad?" I ask, "he's fine," she replies, "darling, we planned to make a small party for Samri's birthday at the beach house this Friday, for the weekend. I want you to be there," mom never took negotiations, she always has it her way, "okay mom, I'll be there. You know no one can debate you," I say and she laughs, "I know darling, see you then, at seven," she informs. "Okay mom, love you!" I tell her, "me too darling," she says and hangs up.

The place is packed with people. "Yo A," I hear someone shout out from the back. Nobody has called me that way since college. I turn and see Rob coming my way, "what!! Dude, are you still alive?!" I play with the old friend, "yup, just been in my world," he responds, and we hug it out. "Where have you been? Haven't seen you in like what, four years now?!" I say with disbelief, "you even look different, with your beard and everything," I continue, "I know man. Many things are changed in my life. When I got a message from Isaac yesterday, I had to come down and visit you guys," he says, "are you saying you don't live here anymore?" I ask, taking in the surprises, "yeah man, like I said my life has changed up. I hated the party life here, so I decided to leave. I live in Manda now. Got a good job and got married. I have beautiful daughter now," he throws the bomb at me. Years ago, no one would believe Rob would even consider marriage. He was the wild party guy; he had all kinds of girls. I can't think of him settling down at all. "Wow! Congrats dude, I'm really happy for you," I say and give him a quick hug. "Thanks man. I see you in magazines and stuff, what are you now, a hotshot," he plays as I smirk, "it's just for business stuff man, don't even start," I say. "ROBIE!" Isaac shouts from the middle of the room, nobody cares to look as the music is blasting from the speakers. He comes up to us and gives him a tight hug. "How did you find him?" I ask Isaac, "I didn't, he did," he replies. Rob clears my question saying, "I saw the poster that he posted of this party in Facebook, so I wrote him," "and I insisted for him to come up," Isaac continues. "Glad you came dude!" I say. "Quit the chit-chat. Liquor is in the kitchen, let loose guys," Isaac says as he dances into the dancefloor full of people, "I have to make a phone call, I'll be back," Rob says heading out to the backside. I pour beer for myself and drink it up. This is going to be a long night.

I wake up in one of the rooms in the place. My head swirls around and my vision is blurry. I shut my eyes and open it up once again. How much did I drink last night? I turn to my side and I see someone under the sheets next to me, sleeping. I slowly remove the sheets and I see long brunette hair lying beside her bare back. I got laid. I can't even remember how she looks. I get off the bed, grab my clothes and head to the bathroom. I put it on and head out tiptoeing slowly. I see some people sleeping on the couches. Where are the boys? I remember not seeing Joseph last night. I get to the car and drive off the property as I plug in my phone and call Isaac, but I get no answer. I then call Joseph, "Hello," he answers. "Hey man, where are you?" I ask, "I'm in Starbucks, down the street," he replies, "be there in 2 minutes," I hang up and drive. I order a seared steak, egg and tomatillo wrap with vanilla latte and sit with Joseph drinking his coffee Americano. "What the hell happened last night?" I ask, "I don't remember a thing, and I woke up with a brunette next to me. Where were you last night by the way?" I ask again. "Dude I wish I didn't remember what happened last night," he replies leaving me in confusion, "what do you mean?" I ask, "I was with Linda last night, and woke up next to her," he clears my confusion as he rubs his forehead with his elbows on the table. "Your ex?" I ask in puzzlement. She was his girlfriend in college. They broke up because he cheated on her with the 'popular girl' at a party. He tried to convince her that he was drunk and begged for her forgiveness for a whole year, but she didn't buy it. He has never been in an official relationship after her. "From where did she turn up?" I ask, "I don't know dude," he replies, "I guess Isaac brought the whole college to the party," I say shaking my head with a half-smile. Speaking of the devil, my phone rings as Isaac's name lights up on the screen. I pick up and tell him where we are.

I tell Helen to arrange the best perfume from Chanel for my sister's birthday, which will be at the beach house after two days. It is one of her top brands, and I know this because she used to talk about it daily. I head out to the nearest cafe around the corner and order my usual chai latte. The weather is good today, little rain compared to the last few days as fall is right up the corner. I return to the office and enjoy my latte. After about a half hour, a knock I'm familiar with hits the door, "sir, you have a gentleman who wants to see you," she informs. I don't have any appointments until one, "let him in," I order, waiting to see who it is. As I take a sip of my latte and look out my floor to ceiling window behind my desk, a hard knock grabs my attention. I turn and see the door opening, as a huge man comes in. I can't believe my eyes. One of the greatest men in business shakes my hand and sits down. "Mr. Glader, it's very good to see you! What can I get you to drink?" I ask, "nothing, thank you. I came here to talk business with you," he says in his British accent. He's one of the eminence businessmen, and he's sitting in my office, "what can I help you with?" I ask with agitation, "I've seen and heard about your works, and I'm really impressed with it. I have bought a property, and I'm planning to build a plaza. It's a little different from my other properties. I would want you to work with me, what do you say?" He asks. There's nothing in the world that can make me refuse this offer. This would help my business grow, "nothing gives me greater pleasure, sir," I reply, "great, I'll send you the one-year contract and we'll talk in details after that," he says, as he gets up from his seat and shakes my hand firmly. "It's good to do business with you Mr. Zarger," he continues, "likewise," I say with a smile on my face.

Chapter 3

"I just never thought to see one of the greatest business men in my office," I tell the guys. After the meeting with Mr. Glader, I texted them about it and invited them to Shawl's Vineyard. My treat. "Dude, do you know how that's going to make your business grow!" Says Joseph with a smile, "do you know you'll be a celebrity now! Do you know the girls are going to go ballistic over you! I envy you right now man," Isaac begins. "I don't plan on being all over the papers," I say with uncertainty, "it's not in your hands man," he continues with a jerk-like smile on his face. "Anyway, I'm going to be gone to the beach house for the weekend, it's Samri's birthday and folks are doing a little party for her," I say, "we know Samri's little parties are always the opposite," Joseph comments with a smirk. "Exactly, my point is be ready tomorrow at five. We're going to stay for the weekend," I order. "I might have work tomorrow," Isaac answers, "since when do you work after two?" Joseph asks, turning to look at him in amusement. "And when do you ever pass up a party?" I ask puzzled, "you're not acting right, you're hiding something," Joseph again cascades his skills, "nah man, I just got stuff to do," he answers us. He's definitely acting weird, "since when?" I insist, Isaac sighs and says, "fine, I'll cancel," "that's the spirit!" Joseph says out loud and punches Isaac on the arm playfully.

I get to the office late, as it's the last day of the weekend. Helen follows right up with a box covered in black wrapping paper and a red bow on it. She places it on the desk with some papers, "sir, I got what you asked me, and these are Mr. Glader contract papers," she says, "I see, thank you, Helen," I say and she moves out of the office. I start to read the thick papers, which took me about an hour, and finally ink the papers with my signature.

I packed my suitcase and finished getting dressed. I look at the time, ten minutes to five. Joseph will be here any minute. We decided to take his Rover. I get a sandwich from the kitchen and sit on the couch, switching on the tv. I hear a beep from my phone on the counter as I eat my last bite of sandwich. I knew it was Joseph without checking my phone. So, I aim for the bedroom, get my suitcase and sunglasses, grab my phone and head out. "We're going to make a stop at Shake Shack on the way. I'm hungry as fuck!" I exclaim as I put my case in the trunk. I sit on the passenger seat as Joseph presses on the engine saying, "we're going to go get Isaac first though."

We look at the menu on the large wall, "I'll get a Chick'n Shack with Shack-made Lemonade," he informs and heads to the counter. "That was fast," Joseph smirks. Joseph has always been so slow in choosing. I remember once, we waited for him for about half an hour just for him to pick. "I'll get a Smoke Shack with some cheese fries and vanilla shake," I say, "don't be late, we got to get going," I follow Isaac to the queue. We started with this resolution since college, choosing our orders out loud to help Joseph choose his easily. It has been going well all those years. He follows us after a little while.

We get to the house. I see Samri's and my parents' cars parked outside. We park next to Samri's car and Isaac gets off and heads to the trunk, as Joseph clicks the button for the trunk to open. We get our bags and go in the house. "We're here!" I shout on the empty space. Mom approaches us filling the space with her perfume, "hello darling, I see you brought Isaac and Joseph with you," she says with a wide smile on her face as she hugs and kisses me on my cheek. "Yeah, you know how they are," I say playfully looking at the boys. She moves to Joseph then Isaac. "You know how Abel gets when we're not around," he fires back as mom takes his side saying, "I do know how he gets," and they all laugh. "Stop," I wine and head to my room down the hallway, as I hear Isaac complimenting my mom about her perfume. Joseph gets the first room in the hallway and Isaac gets the room next to Samri's.

"Boys, we'll be waiting in the dining room for dinner after an hour!" Mom shouts from the entrance of the hall, "okay mom," "yes Mrs. Zarger," "alright," we all reply from our rooms. I throw myself on the bed and fall asleep.

I woke up to the sound of the loud bang of Samri's door. She does that whenever she argues with Mom. I unpack my suitcase and head to the bathroom. After a good, cool shower, I feel myself relax more. I dress up and head to the dining room and see where the noise filling the house was coming from. I see Joseph sitting on the dining table throwing his head backwards laughing hard with Mom, as Isaac babbles something smiling widely. "What you guys gossiping about?!" I ask walking to their side, "how you were bitching about getting up to a girl by your side," Isaac replies, a wide smile glued on his face as Joseph tries to maintain his laugh. "Oh Isaac, stop teasing my boy," mom slaps his shoulders playfully as she blows me a kiss and goes out of the kitchen. "Are you freaking crazy? It's like I can't say anything to you guys!" I hiss out. "Dude, he's just messing around," Joseph says calmly, "calm down man, I'm sure Mrs. Z doesn't believe me," Isaac follows. It's good that I didn't tell them about Her. Dad comes in the room, "hello boys, I see you're in time to eat for the first time," "hey Mr. Z," Isaac greets as he sits on the chair. "How's work boys?" Dad asks, as usual, "it's going good, dad," I reply and sit glancing widely at the guys in front of me, indicating not to play around. Mom gets in the room with the food and Samri helps. "Well, look who just turned up!" I say playfully getting up from my seat receiving a hug from her, "well, if it isn't my goofy brother," she responds, "I guess somethings never change," I tease her as she moves and hugs Isaac and Joseph, and sits between them. "Stop with the nonsense and let's eat!" dad orders.

We sit in the living room and drink some wine and talk work stuff with dad, as mom and Samri chit-chat in the corner couches. The bell rings, making us all pause for a moment. "They're here," Samri says bolting the room and running to the door. "Who's here?" I ask mom, "might be her friends," she replies. We hear girls screaming and shouting, and mom moves out closing the room's door. I'm sure Isaac doesn't want to be in this room right now. I laugh silently at the thought.

It's one a.m. and we're getting kind of drunk sitting on the patio, empty vodka bottles and beer all over the table talking about life. "We should go to sleep guys," Joseph says lazily as he gets up with difficulty, "the night is still young," Isaac dismisses his thought, "I think I'm drunk," I say as I yawn. "I'm out," Joseph stumbles to the room, "we should too man," I say trying to get up, "how much did we drink?" I ask. Isaac starts to laugh for no reason, which makes me laugh at him. "Get up man," I say trying to raise him up, "I don't need help man," he says shoving my hand lazily and gets up, tripping to the door. I have a bad migraine, so I go to the kitchen to drink some water. I poorly stumble to the entrance of the kitchen, and I see a figure standing with the fridge opened. There's a little light coming from the fridge but I can't figure out who it is, due to my blurry vision. "Oh my God!" She says out loud, "shush... don't let them wake up," I say. She might be one of the friends, she moves to turn on the lights. I can't help but stare again after she switches it on. She's here, again. The infant face stares at me, "you feeling okay?" She asks as I come to my senses, "yeah, just wanted to get some water," I answer as I maneuver to the sink. I want to punch myself in the throat right now, "oh okay, umm, I just came for some strawberry yogurt," she says smiling as she holds the yogurt up to show me. I give her a firm nod with a tight smile. She turns and heads to the room, and I can't help but stare at her stunning curves sticking to the fabric of her sleep dress. Is she Samri's friend? I can't mess around now! I head to my room and I stop beside Samri's door, wanting to hear what if she tells the girls she ran into me. What in the world am I doing? This is so not me!

I get under the covers and think about what just happened. I got to stop, she's my little sister's friend. It wouldn't be appropriate at all. I need to sleep. I switch off the lamp on the nightstand and close my eyes to sleep.

Chapter 4

I finish taking a shower, and dress up a white muscle-fit t-shirt with curved hem and black joggers, spraying my favorite One Million cologne and tie my Milgauss watch. I open the door to the loud music ruining my eardrums. I hold my gift and make my way to the kitchen, as that's our favorite place to gather around. I see no sight of the boys when I get there, "Happy birthday ugly face," I say with a teasy smile on my face and hand her my gift. "What did you bring me blockhead?" She slams back as she opens up the present. "Stop with the hogwash and let's see what your brother got you," mom advises. "OH. MY. GOD. I can't believe you!" She hugs me, squeezing my neck with her tiny arms. "How did you know this was my brand?" She asks, grinning as she examines the perfume. "It got stuck in my head when you were on repeat about it," I mock. "Oh, my smart boy," mom says as she comes closer and kisses my cheek. I think she will never stop seeing me as a little boy. Dad appears with a black velvet box in his hand, "Why you cornered up like little girls," he says, "darling, happy 22nd birthday." He declares as he kisses Samri and hands her the box. "I wish everyday was my birthday," she says in high spirits and we laugh at her. She opens the box and her eyes waters, "This is just too much," she comments looking at the shiny gold necklace, as few strands of tears run down her cheek, "are you trying to ruin my makeup?" She says and wipes it off carefully. "Oh honey," mom hugs her, "we don't want you to cry on your birthday," she tells her. "They're just happy tears, mom." She waves it off. She has always been so sensitive, yet stubborn. "We'll leave you guys party now, we'll see you in two weeks," mom tells us, "Take care of your sister," dad adds patting hard on my shoulder. "Of course, dad," I say. They hug us goodbye and the boys show up giving their presents to Samri as she thanks them. I get the glasses and the alcohols out of the cupboards and we start to drink up.

I stare at her again, swaying to the beat on the dancefloor, "Hey sexy!" A girl says who looks intoxicated as I stand leaning on the wall sipping my beer. "Hey you!" I reply smirking. She's not one of Samri's friends, she's good to go. "I want to dance," she informs before pulling my hand to the dancefloor. The lights are a little dim, she's pretty but definitely a little tipsy. She rounds her arms to my neck and start to freak dance, she has moves. I hold her still by rounding my arm to her stomach as her backside is on my lap. "Want to go somewhere?" I whisper slowly to her ear. She nods. I lead her taking her hand to my room. I lock the door as she looks around my room. "Your room looks cozy," she comments. "I know. It'll be cozier with you now," I say winking with a smirk. Her dark green eyes blink up at me as I get closer to her face. She expression changes, she looks as if she's trying to fight something back. She runs to the bathroom and I hear her throwing up. Just great! I slowly walk to the bathroom when I hear nothing, "You okay?" I murmur, "I'm so sorry, I guess I had too much to drink" she answers, sitting on the floor in front of the crapper without looking at me. "It's okay babe," I reassure, as I come closer and help her get on her feet. "Want to take you home?" I ask, "No," she responds, "I'll be fine. I got to go to my girls," she adds and kisses me on the cheek, and heads for the door.

I pour some vodka to the beer, "Won't that be too much?" I look up and see her, again. "Not to me," I brag with a half-smile. She smiles as if she liked what I said, she comes closer, "I dare you to put more vodka," she says closer to my face, provoking me. I spill the vodka in the cup filled with beer, smirking at her. She takes the bottle from my grip and pours it in an empty rainbow cup, and fills with beer. "Cheers!" she says smirking at me as she holds her cup up, her confidence radiating in the air, "Cheers." I say clinking her cup. She turns and walks out the kitchen. I want to go after her, but my ego is too high. I look at that curvy body of hers covered in a black, tight jumpsuit. She is interesting. Just beautiful!

I sit on the seat in the patio, taking in the cool air. I see people taking off their clothes, ready for the beach. I hear a loud laugh as she steps to the patio, and Isaac behind her smiling. What is he doing with her? He sees me, "there's my guy," he says. I can see he's drunk while he comes to my way and bumps my shoulder, "Have you met Ari?" He solicits. Finally, I know something about her, "No, I haven't" I answer as I eye her and smirk. She walks closer to us and sit facing me, and extends her arm, "hi, I'm Ari." She says smirking. Oh, she's good. "I'm Abel," I say griping her soft hand. "So formal," Isaac intrudes, "She's Sam's friend," he continues. "Oh yeah, I never met you before, how do you guys know each other? I ask, she might not be a dear friend to her, at least I hope she won't be. "We've been friends since freshmen year," she replies getting my hopes collapse. "Second year now, and still going strong," she says with a smile on her face, that's not good news to me. "Where's Samri by the way?" I ask as I get irritated by the information she just threw at me, "Dancing." Isaac says looking annoyed. "I'm going to leave you guys," she says as she gets up and walks away. "What are you doing with Samri's friend?" I ask, hiding my exasperation. "I know the girl man, isn't she hot?" He smiles, making me want to punch him in the face. "Let's go get a drink," I say flipping the subject.

I dance with a tall, dark-haired girl the whole night. We sit on the couch, "I'll use the restroom, be right back," she says kissing me and leaving. I relax and drink my beer, as I see Ari talking, very close than necessary, to a tall blonde guy. Thank God it isn't Isaac. Anger surfaces my face, and I get up and walk towards them, looking at the guy who is giving me his back as he is leaning in with his arm on the wall, trapping her. I turn my back to walk backwards to them. I bump into him and pour the beer in my cup as I turn to see him, "What the fuck dude, shit!" He curses, "Oh shit, I'm sorry man, didn't see you," I say faking an apology. "I'll be back," he tells her feeling annoyed and moving away. She smiles looking at the floor as if she knew I intended to do it, "I really didn't see him," I explain, as if trying to convince her that I didn't. "Slow down with the beer-vodka," she says smiling, and I can't help but stare. "Want to dance?" I ask bluntly, I know what I'm doing might not be the best decision, but one little dance won't hurt. "Sure," she replies. I hold her soft hand and lead her to the floor. I close the space between us and we dance to the rhythm of Sean Paul's Tek Weh Yuh Heart. She moves her hands from my packs to my abs, feeling them, and relaxing her arms on my shoulders. I slowly move my hands from her waist to her curves, eagerly wanting to feel every inch of her, yet scared to not piss her off. The way she moves is magnificent. I know I got to stop this, but I can't. It's like unsticking a magnet. She smells good, which makes me want to plant a kiss on her tempting nape. "I got to go," she interrupts my thoughts, I want to ask her why, but instead I replied, "Thanks for the dance," winking at her, planning to make her think I'm not attracted to her. She smiles and leaves me on the floor. Why the hell would she go in the middle of the dance? Nobody did that to me before! Did I touch her inappropriately? Angry at myself for letting her make me feel this way. I head to the kitchen for some shots. It's the only way to ease up my thoughts.

It's my fifth shot as Joseph says to be easy on the drinks. "What you upset about?" He asks sitting on the dining table. "Nothing," I reply. We don't speak for the next ten minutes as I continue to take two more shots and he drinks his beer. "She left me on the freaking dancefloor, man," I say unexpectedly. "That's new, who is the brave girl?" He asks mocking me. I give him a cold look. "No name?" He asks. I don't want to tell him who she is. "You can get each and every girl in this party dude, since when are you down cause of a girl? He points out. "You're right man, being a pussy isn't my thing," I say feeling encouraged, "there's the spirit," he laughs. "I think you should ease up on the shots dude," he advises, "you're right," I reply lazily. I get up and feel completely dizzy, "Woah, c'mon dude, I'll help you get to your room." He takes my arm around his neck and drags me to the hallway. "You have always been so.... I don't know man, I think I'm drunk," I say laughing at my nonsense. "Stop being all girly on me now dude," he warns and laughs. He throws me on the bed, "Night dude," he says switching off the lights as the light of the sunrise fills the room. I remember everything, her moves, her touch, her curves, as I drift away to sleep.

I wake up to the loud laughter outside my room. I go to the bathroom to freshen up. I see Joseph among the girls saying something and the girls start to laugh as they all ate breakfast. I don't see Isaac, nor Samri in the dining room. And I don't see her too. "Good morning," I address, "Good Morning," the girls reply as Joseph shifts his eyes to notice me. "How'd you sleep?" He asks, "Pretty good," I lie. It feels like I haven't slept at all. "Where's Isaac?" I ask, "Probably sleeping," he replies. "Want some egg and bacon?" One of Samri's friend asks, "Yes, please. I'm starving," I answer as she smiles. A while later, Samri and Ari joins us as Isaac follows. I convince myself to not look or talk to her. Besides, I can't do what I want since she's Samri's friend. It's a lot better if I keep my distance.

We put the bags in the trunk. "See you after two weeks big brother," Samri says, "Take care, and don't fool around much!" I tease as I give her a hug. The boys hug the girls goodbye and I see Ari coming to my side. "Go easy on the beer-vodka," she mocks beautifully, "Back at you," I say smiling goofily at her, glad to finally talk. I look at the guys, they're still chit-chatting, I look back at Ari, "What you doing' on a Friday night?" I ask unexpectedly, surprising myself. I look at her startled face, "umm nothing, why?" She asks, looking for an answer. "Want to take you out," I reply letting my ego down. I guess thinking about keeping my distance was just bullshit. She looks taken aback, glancing at my sister, then back at me, "sure," she says hesitantly. I don't want her to change her mind so I immediately ask for her number.

Chapter 5

I don't text her for the next four days, making work my first priority. And I don't want her to think I'm head over heels for her. I know what I'm doing may jeopardize her friendship with Samri, because I know how Samri gets when her girls want to hang out with me. But we're both adults, and she has already made the decision to go out with me, knowing Samri won't be comfortable with it.

I wake up late, and it's Friday. Didn't go to work today. Should I text her now? No, I didn't even eat breakfast yet. I need to get ahold of myself. I take a hot shower and eat breakfast. I sit on the couch watching tv as I grab my phone. It's one thirty p.m. I should text her. I click the messages button. I stare at the screen for five whole minutes, trying to figure out how to start. Should I flirt? Should I just get to the point? Why am I so oblivious all of a sudden! I start typing, 'Hey Ari, Ready for tonight?' I send. Was it a little formal? I wait for a ding for the next ten minutes. What in the world is taking her too long? She might have a class or something. It wouldn't hurt if she just replies a 'yes'. My phone dings right away, I grab my phone with enthusiasm and I see Isaac's name on the screen, damn it! Just the perfect time for him to send a message. I open up the message, 'Party at 9 p.m. tmw, we'll pass you then', I type, 'Cool' and lock the phone frustrated. Is she upset because I didn't text her earlier? I try to busy myself in the bedroom for the next hour, and I hear a ding from the front room. I grab the phone and I finally see her name pop up on the screen. 'I'm guessing you're Abel', I realize I only took her phone number. 'Yeah, forgot you didn't have my number', 'Is 8 okay?', she texts, '8 is good, I'll come get you'.

I wait as I softly dab on the steering wheel. What is taking her so long? I'm outside her dorm apartment, which took me half an hour to arrive. Samri has always been sensitive with me messing around with her friends. I remember her defriending them because they were being nuisance, telling her to spy on me. I said I'd back off, and I did, except for this one. I just want to get to know her, nothing to hurt their friendship. The door opens and she moves to the seat, "Sorry I'm late," she says with her teeth sparkling. I kind of missed her smile. She has a red, long, sleeveless, maxi bandage bodycon dress on, which leaves her right thigh half naked. "It's all good, where do we head to?" I ask, "I don't have anything in mind, surprise me!" She says. So daring! Turns me on! "Alright then," I say as I drift and drive off.

The waiter goes away taking our orders, leaving us both alone again. We're sitting at the Blue-Sky Restaurant. "You impressed?" I ask as my ego bursts out in the air. "I'll give you an eight," she smiles wickedly, "An eight?!" I ask hiding my injured ego, a half smile splattered on my face. "Don't eat too much, I know the best place," she says surprising me more. "You are not what I had in mind," I say abruptly, "hmm, what did you have in mind?" She asks eyeing me. The waiter comes, delivering our food and scurries off. I continue, "well, you're spontaneous and bold", "you're an observer," she says smiling as she digs into her food. "You have a long way to get to know me, Mr. Zarger," she continues, which leaves me smiling at her. I can hardly wait.

We sit in the car after a good, short dinner. She types an address on the GPS, "It's only ten minutes to drive from here, you'll love the place" she says. I take a glance at the address and take off. We arrive at the destination. There is a big food cart with several seats beside the beach. The view is spectacular. "How did you find this place?" I ask in awe. "A friend recommended it once, it's a Turkish place" she answers, smiling at me. We go out and head for the seats. There's a cool breeze airing us, "I can tell you like this place," she says as we sit, "You read me well," I say. "What do you want to get?" She asks, "I don't know, surprise me," I reply smiling, pointing out her previous comment, she smiles as she leaves our seat. The way she moves in a graceful way makes me stare, again.

The waiter gets our food to the table. "I can assure you this will be one of the best ones you ever tasted," she says. "What is it?" I ask examining the food with my eyes. It looks way different than the food I eat. "It's called pide stuffed with beef. It's traditional," she answers, "try it," she dares. I take a bite. She is right, luscious is the word for it. The cheese melts in my mouth, making me go for another bite. "This is just fantastic, not the way it looks," I say as she takes her bite, "I know," she says. "So, tell me something," I say, wanting to know more about her, "do you always drink beer-vodka?" She laughs at my question, "Well, I don't. I just drank it at a frat party, and it ended up badly," she answers cheerfully, "Was it your first time?" She asks back, "Yeah, haven't really got used to mixing alcohol," I reply with a smirk. "There's a first time for everything," she says. "How did you know Isaac by the way? I ask smoothly, as it has been stuck in my mind after seeing them together. "Umm, I know Isaac a while ago now," she says, "he came to a party we had." That's new. Since when does he go to college parties? How come he never told us that before? "So, you met him at a party?" I ask wanting to know more, "Yeah, I met him through a friend of mine. How do you guys know each other? She asks shutting me down. "I met Isaac and Joseph since college years. We're practically brothers." I answer, wanting to make a point and let her realize she can't date two brothers. "That's sweet," she says with her glimmering teeth popping. Should I ask her if she want to go up to my place, or that might make her run away. "Truth or dare?" she asks stealing me from my thoughts, she just gets so interesting. "Truth," I answer, wondering what she might ask, she smirks as she asks, "First heartbreak?" This is definitely not the question I want to hear. I'll just lie and escape this situation. "No lies, you know that's the rule," she says reading my thoughts. Damn! Should I spill it? I'm sure she won't go running to tell my sister, my family knowing about her is the last thing I want right now, as mom has been nagging on me about marriage the past year. And besides, she looks like a secret keeper. "My first heart break was about a few weeks ago," I reveal, not realizing why I just told her out of all people. "Wow, I'm sorry!" She says surprised, "I didn't expect you to answer, since you took too long," she adds. "It's okay, shit happens," I close the topic, "my turn, truth or dare?" I ask, trying to conceal my distress. "Dare," she replies, leaving me smirk at her expected answer, "I thought so," I tell her as she gives me a sexy, half smile. I don't want to think about Samri's feelings right now, we're not kids anymore. I want her, "Let me do one thing," I tell her. She looks at me puzzled, "like what?" She asks, "no questions allowed," I smirk. The waiter comes up to us with the check, "I'm sorry but we should close now," he says. "We'll get going, thank you!" I tell him and he walks off. I pay up the bill and we get to the car.

I start the engine and drive off as Ari says nothing on the way, she might be thinking about the dare. "Don't think about it too much, just trust me," I assure her as she gives me the same sexy, half smile of hers. We get to her building and I shut down the engine, "Thank you for tonight, I had a great time," I tell her, waiting for her to ask me to go to her room, as all the girls do. "Thank you, I did too," she says. "I'm just thinking about the dare, you told me to let you do one thing, and you also said I can't ask what it is," she says, "Yeah," I reply, "Well, aren't you going to do it already?" She asks, "Don't rush it, I want to take my time," I answer. "Okay!" She says as her face expression changes, making me want to laugh at her nervousness. "I have to head to the girls, thanks again for tonight," she says smiling as she hugs me and goes off. Leaving me dumbfounded, this girl is just full of surprises, not like the others at all. I got to think about my dare more, this is going to be fun.

Chapter 6

I spend the next day at the party, bored. I decide to head home after just two hours of arrival. I tell Joseph I'm out, as I know Isaac is nowhere to found, probably even drunk. I get to the penthouse, throwing myself to bed. I grab my phone, no sight of Ari's calls or texts. Should I text her? I don't want to look like I'm chasing after her. I put back the phone on the nightstand and doze off to sleep. I spend the next few days working hard with Mr. Glader. I work eleven hours in a day, it gets stressful and leaves me with no enough sleep. But it is definitely worth it. I get well paid, and also got many customers. I should start to think of making my small office a bit bigger, and also hire someone who can help me with my projects. It took me two years of hard work and patience to be in this position right now. Hard work always pays off.

I sit on the couch, watching tv and eating my tuna sandwich. Finally, I get to put work to the side and just relax. I grab my phone; she hasn't texted at all after that night. Why?! I put my thoughts down and text her, 'Hey'. I get a reply after three minutes, 'hey you', 'what's up?' I text back. 'Hanging out, what are you doing?', 'Same, alone. Want to come over?'. I hope she says okay, I can have fun a little. 'Have you made dinner yet? I'm starving!', she writes, which leaves me laughing, 'Me too, Pizza or Chinese?' I lie, 'Pizza would be great', she texts. I text her the address and tell her I'll be waiting.

The doorbell rings which makes me stumble a little. She has come! I spray my favorite cologne and head for the door. I see the delivery guy when I open the door. What a bummer! I pay the guy and put the pizzas on the table. I have ordered vegan and chicken pizza, in case if she doesn't like one of them. I get the white wine from the fridge and place it on the ice bucket near the pizza with two wine glasses. I search for some romance DVDs to watch, I got to have her tonight. The doorbell rings again, finally! I open up the door and I see her wearing white sneakers, leather pants with a white tight shirt and leather jacket, leaving her dark, curly hair open. She definitely knows fashion. She looks breath-taking. "Just in time, pizza just got here," I speak, "Great, I'm starving," she says giving me a hug, she smells like vanilla. "Keep yourself at home," I say as I let her in. "Nice place," she says as she eyes around the penthouse, "got this place for quite a while now," I say unnoticing my explanation. "It looks cozy," she says, still not looking at me, "have a seat, be right back," I say excusing myself to the bedroom.

We eat the last slices of the pizza and drink the last sips of wine as we sit on the carpet side by side. Talking about my youthful days, and talking about college. "Oh God, I don't know if I'm drunk or not," she says and laughs at her comment. "I think you're drunk," I tell her and she laughs at my comment too, which makes me smile. "I've been thinking," she says nonchalantly, "what did you do about my dare?" She asks. I stare at the beautiful lazy eyes looking at me, should I do it? "I gave it a deep thought," I reveal getting closer to her, "and I've come up with an idea," I continue. "Which is?" She whispers eagerly, staring up close at my lips, "you got to close your eyes and trust me on this," I order. She takes a minute, then follows my command. I get closer facing her as she shuts her eyelids, finally I'll do what I have dreamt about doing. I hope I don't get slapped after this, she doesn't seem like the girls I've met. I feel nervousness fill in me, but I shut it down and pursue my idea. I caress her silky face, which makes her closed eyes twitch a little. I get closer and let my lips touch hers, so soft, I mesmerize this feeling. She kisses me back, widening her lips, which caught me off guard. A feeling inside me erupts, I run my fingers threw her hair as I kiss her deep, and she moans inside my mouth. She is just extraordinary. I go on and touch her curves with my other hands, I think I'll never get enough of those loops. "Oh God, we need to stop," she says as she pushes me back, "c'mon we both want this," I touch her again, trying to persuade her. "No Abel, we should stop," she demands as she moves to get on her feet tipsily, "okay, okay! Let me help you," I say and help her stand steady. Another night of bad luck, "I'll get you home," I say, a little irritated and move my feet to the bedroom to get my jacket. I help her out and let her sit in the car.

We arrive to her building, as I open my door to help her get up. She grabs my hand as I was about to move to get up from my seat, "don't," she says, "I don't need help, I can do it on my own," she mutters, "you sure?" I ask with worry, "yes, besides I don't want Sammy to see us together," she declares. "What do you mean?" I ask, knowing what she meant, "she doesn't like any of us hanging around with you," she reveals. "Oh really? How'd you know? Did she tell you guys not to hang with me?" I ask, wanting to know more, "no, but she had told me the stories of how she disliked some of her ex friends dating you, which caused their friendship to end," she says looking at me, "and I don't want to be one of them. She's the only real friend I got." I feel bad that she got involved in this whole roller-coaster. "We were kids at that time, I'm sure she doesn't think that way anymore," I say, afraid for her to cancel me out. "Well, we don't know for sure," she says as she opens the door and gets off the car. "Thanks for tonight, had fun!" She says from the open window, "I had fun too," I smile hiding my little anxiety, is she cancelling me out? I don't want her to, but I can't be selfish and end her friendship with my sister. "Goodnight," she says, "have a cold drink before you go to sleep, you'll feel better," I advise, not wanting her to leave me hanging with my thoughts of her. I want to know if she still wants to go on with me, "I'll do whatever makes me feel better," she smiles goofily, I can't help but smile back, "go get some rest, I'll text you tomorrow," I tell her, hoping for her not to shut me down, "alright, see you!" She says. My heart finally relaxes, "goodnight beautiful," I say, and she smiles back and walks away.

Chapter 7

I wake up in a really good mood, thinking about last night, the delightful kiss kept me imagining doing things to her. I get ready to go to work the next morning as my phone rings, 'mom' flashing on the screen, "good morning mom," I greet, "morning darling, are you at work?" She asks. "I'm on my way, what's up?" I ask, "I don't want you to forget to come this weekend, as you do most of the time," she demands, I've always made different kinds of excuses to not go to my parents' house. Either it's 'cause of parties or get away of mom's talks about marriage. That's like the only thing she thinks about nowadays, I know she wants what's best for me, but I just haven't found the one that fills up my heart, after Her. "I won't forget mom, I promise," I assure, "great, see you then darling," she says and we hang up.

I spend my day in Mr. Glader's office, working on the huge building. "How long have you been in this business, Mr. Zarger?" He asks, "for about two years now," I answer. "That's a while," he says, "how come you're not known much in business? I've seen your works, they're superior," he comments. "Well, you know how business is, you need to have support from the higher class in order to get to the top. I need to thank you for it," I say as I take a sip of the rich coffee placed on the table. "No thanks needed! It's just your turn in this business role, just get the best of it," he remarks. "I got a proposal for you, I need you to think about it intelligibly," he directs. Any kind of proposals from him, I'm ready to take. "Yes sir," I say listening, "I want to extend my contract to five years with you. I have plans to enlarge my company worldwide, and I want you to work with me, make it the best than ever," he suggests, making jaw drop for a split second. Is he really offering me this enormous proposal? Does he mean I'm going to travel to work worldwide? I have to think about this clearly. "Do you mean I'll travel to places for work?" I ask to make sure, "Yes, but not always, only when you have to see the properties and all, you know how it is," he says, "besides, do you know how this will affect your business?" He continues, trying to convince me. "Yes sir, I am completely aware. And I accept your proposal," I answer, surprising him and myself, "are you sure, Mr. Zarger? You should give it a thought, don't you think?" He asks, "Sir, I have been longing for this to happen. And now you're proposing something that will benefit my company, I don't need to think if it's to my advantage," I say, "You're a smart man, Mr. Zarger. I'll send you the contract next week," he comments, "Thank you, sir," I say and we get back to work.

I park at my parents' place, finally I can some rest, after hectic days of work. "I'm home," I shout out as I close the front door behind me, "welcome home, darling," mom comes up and gives me a hug. "We have been waiting for you, dinner is almost ready. Go to your room and freshen up," she orders, "okay mom, where are they?" I ask, "they're in the tv room, playing Ludo as usual," she says, "be right down," I tell her and go to my old bedroom.

It's all in place, mom never threw out our things after we moved out. Pictures of me and my friends from junior school, medals I got for long distance racing and scholarships when I was in high school. I was the popular guy with good grades kind of guy. I change my clothes and head downstairs to the tv room. "Who's winning?" I ask looking at dad and Sam playing hard, "I am," she says with a wide smile as she gets up and gives me a hug, "hey dad," I greet, "hello son, came just in time. Take my place, I have to go to your mother," he says and leaves us alone. "Ready to get your ass beaten!?" She declares, "You're so dead," I say as we play. "So, what have you been up to? You don't text anymore," I ask, "yeah, been busy with school," she answers, as I see something change in her face. She has always been good in school, she's a little naughty and upfront, but she gets the best grades since she started school. "College is difficult, you need to put much effort to achieve," I tell her, "I know, I know big bro," she says, rolling her eyes which makes me laugh." "So, tell me," I say, "is somebody taking your time, besides school?" I ask her with a half-smile, she looks a little nervous, "no, why do you ask," she says looking at me intently, "whoa, nothing. Chill out, just asking," I say. "Well, stop asking stupid questions," she says and pursues with the game, which makes me laugh at her. "What about you?" She asks, "nope," I say, simply hiding the truth. "I'm not surprised, all you do is mess around," she says smiling, "you got a problem with that?" I ask teasing her, "nope, as long as you keep your claws away from my girls," she says, which leaves me in an uncomfortable position. Some things will never change, will it?

"Dinner is on the table, come eat!" Mom shouts, "coming!" Sam shouts back. We sit on the dining table and we eat. Mom laughs at Sam's comment as she teases me, "stop messing around with the boy," dad tells her, "he's the one who always starts," she tells dad. We leave them tidying the table as dad and I go sit in the tv room. "How's work with Mr. Glader?" He asks. I've told him about the one-year contract at Sam's party, "Mr. Glader just comes with surprises, dad," I tell him. "What do you mean? Is he cancelling out?" He asks, which makes me a little down. He never was a fond of me choosing architecture, he always wanted me to be a laboratory technician just like him. But I didn't have the heart for it. "No dad, he wants to extend the contract to five years. He wants me to work with him abroad," I tell him, "Oh, that's great news," he says with a smile, "Oh My God, I can't believe it," mom comes in shouting, I guess she heard the conversation. She has been supportive since day one, and she went ballistic when I told her I'm working with Mr. Glader, "from one-year to five, that is awesome, baby," she says giving me a long hug and a kiss, "I know mom, he told me to think about it, because of travelling and all," I tell her as she cuts me saying, "no need for thoughts, darling. You should get that job," "I already agreed to work with him," I continue, she screams again and hugs me tight, "that is great for your company, son," dad says as he pats my shoulder, "we're proud of you," he smiles at me. "Congrats bro, does that mean you'll be famous now," Sam says with a goofy smile, "you're so giving me your credit card," she says as we all laugh at her silliness.

Chapter 8

I head to my room after a long night with the family. I lay in bed and grab my phone and text, 'hey you' and press send. I miss her, I want to see her again, but does she want to me? 'Hey', she texts back, 'what you doing', 'getting ready, you?' Getting ready at twelve a.m., that's weird, 'getting ready for bed? I'm just lying in bed, thinking of you!', I text her, as worry fills me. 'It's my cousin's birthday, so we're heading to a night club. Lying in bed on a Friday night? Are you sick?' She texts making me laugh, did she just ignore the fact that I said I am thinking of her? This woman is just not easy. 'Lol no, it's 'cause I'm at my parent's house', I text back, 'I know, Sammy told me'. Of course, how did I forget that? 'Well, have fun. Take care, don't drink beer-vodka.' I write, 'no worries *wink*.' An unfamiliar feeling erupts in me as I think of some guy dancing, touching or kissing her. I roll to my side any fasten my eyes to sleep.

I couldn't sleep as two hours pass by. I keep thinking of her in the club with someone else, I get my phone and text, 'write me the address of the place, I'm coming,' I'm sure she'll think I'm somewhat crazy but hell, I can't help myself imagining her with another guy, 'are you serious? I don't think it's a good idea', she texts back after few minutes, 'trust me, it's a great idea, waiting!' I wait and she texts me the address.

I get to the destination, which is about thirty minutes away from the city, in a small town called Aria. I get in the club, it is packed with people. I search for her around the room, there's no sign of her. I move to the bar and get a glass of black bottle. I look for her in the crowd, and get a glimpse of her in the corner seats with other girls. I make my way to them as I see her laugh hard with the girls, a phenomenal display. "Hello ladies," I greet as I approach their seat. They all turn and take a look at me, "well hello there, handsome," the blonde girl sitting in the middle speaks, and I smirk at her. "What can we do for you?" A dark-haired girl follows up, "I came to ask this beautiful brunette for a dance," I say looking at Ari and stretching my arm, who is looking at me with a smile. She gets up and takes my hand saying, "I'd love to." We leave the table while the girls murmur behind us. "You're so crazy," she says with a smile, "you will get used to it," I tell her with a smirk.

We spend the night dancing and laughing, and getting to know the girls. "Your cousin seems nice," I tell her as we dance to the slow music, "yeah, she can be crazy at times, but she is lovely," she apprises. "Want to go grab something to eat?" I ask her as the music comes to a halt, "I'd love that. I'll go to the girls and be back," she says as she blows me a kiss teasingly, I pretend to grab her kiss and kiss my folded hand. She laughs at my goofiness and heads to the girls. I order cold water to drink, so I can sober up a bit to drive. She comes with her jacket and purse in her arm and we head out. The cold breeze makes us put on our jackets as we sit in the car, "you good to drive?" She asks, "never been better," I tell her as I look at her infant face, I wouldn't hate to kiss her right here, right now. "Great, let's go to the nearest fast food, I got to get back to the girls," she informs and I nod. As I drive, she says, "why did you come up here, it's a little far from your parents' house," I don't know how to put the perfect answer, "I couldn't sleep," I reply. "Did anyone see you? I'm sure Sammy wouldn't let you go out without her," she says as she smiles, "you know my sister very well. But they all went to bed, so I'm safe," I tell her returning the smile.

Chapter 9

"Oh God, I feel like I won't be able to walk," she says as she sits back on the chair after she eats her last bite of the burger. I laugh at her and drink my coke. "We should get going, the girls are waiting," she tells me, "we still got time," I say, hoping to convince her, "it's almost four, I'm sure the girls are hating on me right now," she insists, "alright, I'll take you girls home," I tell her. We get up and leave the small café and drive off. "I'll wait here, you go get the girls," I tell her and she agrees.

I wait as the girls come out the club. They all look intoxicated that they take forever to get to the car. "Hey handsome," says the dark hair, "hey you, you good?" I ask her, "awesome," she says showing me the 'OK' hand sign and moving to give space for the girls. "C'mon, get in!" I hear Ari telling her cousin as she shoves her into the car, "well, well! If it isn't Ari's boyfriend?" She says, "shut up Sal," Ari fires, making her and the dark hair laugh. I drive off after Ari takes her seat. The girls sing loud to the music bumping in the car, "we're here," Ari announces as I pull up at her cousin's house. The girls get off the car and stumble towards the door, "thank you for tonight," Ari says, "thank you. If it weren't for you, I'd be dead of boredom by now," I tell her and she laughs at my silliness. "You're welcome," she says, "goodnight then," she says looking at me, should I go for it? Will it make her mad? Should I take the risk? I shut my thoughts and follow my heart, uncaring of the consequences, I impel myself closer and kiss her soft lips. She reacts to it, making me deepen the kiss. This only kiss makes me want her, more. "I need to go," she says, breaking her lips from mine, "you're right, the girls are having a hard time to open the door," I inform as I notice them laughing at themselves through the window behind her. "Goodnight," she tells me as she gets off, "night beautiful," I say back, and leave the property after I make sure they got in safe.

"Get up, it's eleven o'clock," Sam shouts, opening up the curtains. "Get out," I order with a raspy voice, "c'mon, what is wrong with you? You even skipped breakfast!" She says annoying me and removing the sheets from the bed, "stop, before I kill you," I warn, "oh please, don't scare me!" She mocks. In a rapid moment, I take her down on the bed and tickle the shit out of her as she shrieks, making mom appear in the room, "what is happening with you, kids! Stop. Get up and take a shower Abel, I know what you've been up to!" She says, making me freeze in my place. What does she mean? Did she see me yesterday? Crap! I'm sure she thinks I was out with the guys, so I'm good. "Mom, tell me what you know. What has he been up to?" Sam follows mom leaving me alone in my room. I dress up after a hot shower and head towards the tv room. While I walk past Samri's room, I hear her saying, "Don't even start, I don't want to talk about him right now. So, tell me how was yesterday! Met any hot guys?" Whom is she talking to, and whom does she not want to talk about, a guy? Is she dating? That's not like Sam. "Really, tell me tell me," she squeaks, "no way, describe him," she continues, "He sounds hot," she says and laughs. "What are you doing, son?" I look up and see dad at the entrance hall. My heart skips a beat, "umm, thought I dropped something," I say as I pace up towards him, "I'm bored, let's play chess," he says, more like a command and we walk to the tv room.

My phone dings in my pocket while we eat tacos at the dining table. I see Ari on the screen, and I open up the text, 'slept okay?' Seeing her text makes me smile, 'not really', I text back and put my phone back in my pocket. "What you smiling about?" Sam asks, as mom eyes me, "nothing, somebody just sent me a funny text," I reply, not wanting mom to start. "Darling, you know you can tell us if you met someone?" Mom asks. How can I run from his situation, "I know mom, but I didn't," I try to shut it down, "leave the kid alone, let him do what he wants," dad defends. We eat in silence for just a few minutes, and mom says, "darling, I know this beautiful girl who lives down the street, she's our new neighbor" "mom, please stop. You know how much I hate it when you bring this up," I interrupt. "Until when are you going to be this way? You know how much I want to see my grandchildren fill up these houses we own," she continues. Mom has always loved children. She has always dreamt of having many kids, but she hadn't got what she dreamt of. She had two miscarriages before me and two after me. Sam was like a gift from God when she was born. But that didn't make mom stop from trying again, but unfortunately, she had another miscarriage. So, I get where she's coming from, but it gets tiring. "I got to go, I have work on standby," I say excusing myself. "But I didn't finish," mom says, "go ahead, son," dad tells me and I head out of the room. I hear mom talk something to dad as I move to my room.

I arrive at the penthouse exhausted. I throw myself in bed and went fast asleep. After three hours of rest, I wake up to my phone ringing. I pick up, "you okay? I called many times, why didn't you pick up?" Sam asks with worry, "I didn't hear it ring," I reply, "are you sleeping?" She asks again, "yeah, just woke up. How's mom?" I ask. "She's okay, as always," she replies as I hear someone talking in the background, "where are you, you home?" I ask, "I'm at my friend's, do you know what time it is?" She says, "no," I reply, "well, it's about eight, anyway I got to go, call you soon," she says and hangs up. It's eight! How long have I slept? I look at my phone and see missed calls from Sam, mom and Joseph, and also see a text message from Ari and Joseph. I quickly open up Ari's text, 'me too, got a bad headache.' Then I open Joseph's text, 'football at my place at nine,' 'dude, where you at? Called you many times,' 'Pass, I'm at my parents',' I lie. I'm not in the mood to hang out, so I force myself to get up and eat something. I lay on the couch watching tv the rest of the night, and doze off to sleep.

Chapter 10

Sunday passes lazily as I occupy myself with work. I sit in my office, waiting for Mr. Dashwood. He has been giving me a hard time with the project, as he keeps changing his thoughts and not being a fond of my conception. He is a strong-minded person, which is a good thing looking at his works.

We take two hours until we finally come to a conclusion. After so long, I finally see Mr. Dashwood smile, "I knew I could count on you," he says, "you've done all the work," I say with gratitude, "well, for all this good work finally done today, drinks my treat," he offers, "That sounds good," I say, and we walk out.

I finally get home with a cheerful spirit after some drinks with Mr. Dashwood. I get a text from Isaac while I unlock my door, 'finally got a promotion, man. Beer at my place tonight at 8, be there!' Damn, that took long. Isaac is very different from us but he is a hard-working, intelligent man. He always knew numbers like the back of his hand. He works at the most successful banks in this country. It has always been his dream to have a bank of his own, I remember him talking about it almost daily when we hung out. Getting this promotion is like longing something that can't be described. He worked day and night, and finally he got what he earned. 'happy for you man, be there at 8.'

"I can't tell you how I felt when he told me. Felt like my ears rang. Didn't see it coming," Isaac talks about his day and takes a good sip of the beer. "Hard work pays off, man," I say patting hard on his shoulder, "indeed," Joseph follows, looking lost in thought. "You okay, man?" I ask him, "she called me before a week ago, and we have been hanging out every day since," he answers, "whom do you mean?" Isaac asks again, "Linda, dude," he says a little loud. "Come the fuck down, I just asked you a question," Isaac fires, "so, what's the big deal?" I ask him again, "she said to give us a try one more time," he replies, unjolly. "Isn't that a good thing?" Isaac asks, confused, "she's not the Linda I used to know, she seems different. Even looks different," he says, "of course man, everybody changes. We surely did," I say, "but why now? After all these years?" He asks us, "I'll give you an advice worth million," Isaac says flipping it humorously, I laugh at the statement, "which is?" Joseph asks, "keep going out with her, there's no hurt in it," he says. I couldn't help but laugh out loud at his simple statement, "why did I even ask for your advice!" Joseph states and smiles at him. "Cheer up dude, life is too short to think of just one Linda," Isaac says and bumps a fist on his shoulder.

Two hours pass by unnoticed as an idea pops up in my head, "I got to get going guys, got to get up early tomorrow," I lie. "C'mon, the night is still young," Isaac says, "Later," I announce and head out. 'I'm starving, haven't had dinner yet. I need someone beautiful to take me to the Turkish food cart,' I text her. I wait as my phone dings after a little while, 'oh really?' She texts, 'yes, I got informed that you know the place. Actually, I'm downstairs waiting for you,' I send, 'you're kidding?! Isn't it late?' She texts back, 'no and no. Don't let me wait too long,' I press send.

"Mmmm, I think this is going to be my new food addiction," I say enjoying the flavors of the cooked meat with chicken sandwich inside the car, as it's a little chilly outside, "what was your old addiction?" She asks smiling at me and taking a bite, "Shake Shack. Yours?" I ask, "Mc Donald's," she says simply. I laugh at her, "what?" She asks, "it's been ages since the last time I ate there," I reply, "really? You can't be serious?" She asks amazed, "you shouldn't be amazed. You know it's kind of antique now, right?" I playfully insult and laugh at her astounded face, "how dare you!" She says with her eyes squinting, making me laugh even more. "Let's make a deal," she says shifting her place to look at me better, I can't help my eyes to stare at her curves covered with the grey, knee length jumpsuit. I've never seen a girl look so beautiful with her normal home wear and sneakers on. Actually, I've never seen any girl with home wear except Sam. She is just different in her own way. "Okay, let's hear it," I say, "I'll take you to Mc Donald's, Friday night, my treat," she orders, "and you take me to the Shake Shack place that you like. No negotiations," she says, reminding me of mom. I smile at her offer, "That is easy. Can I add something to spice it up?" I ask as my dirty thoughts fill me, as always, "okay," she says confidently, "I'll take you to Shake Shack on Saturday, and you spend the rest of the night at my place," I tell her, waiting for her to simply agree, as all the girls did. She looks like she didn't expect what I said as she takes a while to answer, "umm, can I think about it?" She asks, I can't help but laugh at her innocence, "take the time you need, but you only got until Saturday," I answer her. I drive her home and go to my place. I can't stop thinking about her saying to think about something so simple. That never happened to me before. I never got a rejection from any girl I wanted, not that I'm cocky but, she is just not what I had in mind.

Chapter 11

Days passed slowly as Saturday came by. I waited eagerly for this day, just to see her. I get back home from work, and take a warm shower. I kept thinking of her staying with me. It's been long since I got a girl here. I just hope she agrees to stay. I get out and change into my clothes, putting on my blue jeans and black, long sleeve hoodie. I put my favorite gel on my hair and spray Encre Noire on my hoodie. I have to do whatever it takes, for her to stay with me tonight. I've been longing to get my hands on that curvy body. Somehow, unexpectedly I imagine somebody else doing the same thing. It causes something uncomfortable inside me, so I shoo the thought.

I wait fifteen minutes in the car, after I texted her. What is taking her so long? I scroll on my phone, when suddenly I hear girly laughs and shouts. I look up and see Samri leaving the building with some girls. Dammit, not the right time! I duck my head, not wanting her to notice me, or my car. Why in the world did I get myself in this situation, again? It's like I'm back to my college days. I shake my head at my stupidity. I see her hopping in a car, as one of her friends drives the car off. I know what I'm doing is selfish. I don't want to hurt her, but we're adults now. This isn't like the old times, I'm sure she won't get that mad now, right? I try to convince myself poorly. I don't know how I got myself into this! The bad thing is, I don't want to stop. The passenger door opens, snatching me out of my thoughts. I see her black ankle boots, and leather jeans tightly wrapping her curves as she sits and closes the door. I move my eyes up to her cropped blue blouse, making her chest on display, as her small, black leather jacket hardly covering it. "Hey," she greets with her white teeth shown. I want to capture this moment, every inch of her in my memory, for as long as I can, "hey beautiful," I say smiling back at her, "are you ready?" She asks smirking at me, "I've always been ready sweetheart," I reply, fighting the urge to kiss her, and drive off.

I sit on the table near the floor window, waiting for her until she orders for both of us. "So, tell me," I say, as she takes off her jacket and hangs it on the chair, "what?" She asks, I don't reply quickly, as I take in the beauty of her bare arms and chest, "um, are you seeing anyone else?" I ask. Her face is plain, "well, that's a sudden question," she says, shifting in her seat to sit up. Does that mean she's seeing somebody else? I feel a little irritated all of a sudden, "no," she says again, looking at me in the eyes, "I'm not seeing anyone. Are you?" She asks, relief washes over me as I answer sincerely, "no, nobody but you." She smiles and looks down on to the table, "glad to hear that," she says shyly, "I've not seen a girl so shy since high school," I tell her smiling, "I'm not shy," she says looking at the group of people sitting beside us. "Truth or dare?" I ask her, "truth," she says, "ever had a boyfriend?" I ask, she stays quiet, I think she didn't expect the question, as usual, "yes, once," she replies, "did you love him?" I ask again, "I did," she says with a half-smile, "why you guys not together, then?" I ask. She stays quiet again, probably remembering him. "You should only ask one question, Mr." she says squinting her eyes again, making me laugh at her. "I'm going to get the food," she says and moves to the counter.

"I have to say, this is some good shit," I say as I take a bite of the tasty Chicken Legend with Hot Spicy Mayo, "I know right!" She says smiling at me, "we definitely have something in common," I tell her, "which is?" She asks confused, "I've figured that you like spicy food," I say, "you have no idea," she says rolling her eyes and smiles at me, which makes me laugh a little. "If you don't mind, tell me why you're not with your ex?" I ask, turning the conversation, "well," she says leaning back to the chair, "he got a great job. A job he dreamt of, but he was told to work abroad," she says ending the talk, and eats her fries, "I don't think that would've been a problem," I say, needing more information, "I know, but I'm not a fond of long distance relationships. I feel like the happy and sad moments should be felt in real life instead of Facetime or Skype, you know what I mean," she says, "I understand. But let's look on the bright side, all this time you spend away from each other makes you appreciate those rare, special moments you actually get to share," I comment, as an attempt to convince her, not knowing why. "Nothing beats live conversation, hugs, kisses and romantic moments spent together. Not even Skype can replace that wonderful feeling of knowing that your special somebody is just a phone call away," she fires back, convincing me instead, "you're right, can't beat you on that," I say as she smiles at me. She is also intelligent. Is there anything bad about her? Well, I still don't know her yet. "Besides, he has a girlfriend and seems happy," she says, "that's good, right?" I say unconfidently, "yeah, totally," she says smiling at me. Thank God that douchebag didn't have her. She's not someone that you just leave and go. "Have you thought about my offer?" I ask, "I'm not sure about your offer, Abel," she answers. This is the first time hearing her say my name, and I really like it, "why not?" I ask in a croaky voice, "I'm not used to it," she replies hesitantly. I decide to do whatever it takes to change her mind, so I move my chair closer to hers and get my face close to her side face while she bows her head, "you know I don't bite, right?" I say in a raspy voice, putting my arm on top of her chair and see her eyes close as she takes a deep breath. I smile knowing that I influence her like she does to me, "I know," she says, more of a whisper and smiles, "then say okay," I press and nudge my nose on her cheek. I can hear her breathing change, "fine, only on one condition," she orders, "I get to sleep on the couch," she announces, making me move to get a good view of her, "you can't be serious!" I exclaim in great amusement, she turns and looks at me with her beautiful eyes, "I've never been this serious," she says with no hint of laughter. I can't help but laugh at her and say, "since that's what can make you stay with me, alright," I agree, "but it wouldn't make me a man if I let a lady sleep on the couch," I say as we get up and I help her with her jacket, "Thank you," she expresses, "I wouldn't call you a man if you let me sleep on the couch," she says smirking, and heads to the door, leaving me stare at the way she sways again. God, this woman is just phenomenal.

Chapter 12

I wake up the next day, proud that I convinced her to stay here tonight. I never had this much fun with anyone, after Her. I see Ari and Her are so much different, as night and day. Ari is super outgoing, clever, funny, a little goofy in her own way, which brings out the child in me sometimes. I smile at that thought and get out of the shower. And she is also seductive, but I don't think she knows it. Her confidence is my best-loved of all. I see the confidence radiating her when she speaks, which turns me on. And she is also the only one who rejected my offer to stay with me tonight. I've never made an effort to convince a girl to stay with me, not even Her. Not only that, she propositioned to sleep on the couch. I laugh out again while baking some cheddar eggs and potatoes for breakfast. If she is serious about what she said, then I'm not a person who keeps his promises, when it comes to what I want.

It's almost seven, I should head to her, "I'm out," I tell the guys. We gathered up at Joseph's to watch the match, "dude, the match is not finished yet," Joseph says as he watches the game. "Where are you heading, I got to get going too," Isaac says as he gets up from his seat, "what is going on with you guys, do you know it's the final match of the season?" Joseph asks, looking at us astonished, "I got a date," Isaac replies, "me too, man," I say. "You guys must be in love. You never missed one match. Anyway, go ahead, I'll fill you in later," Joseph says, turning to the t.v. Isaac laughs and heads out, as I follow him, thinking about what Joseph said. In love? I smile at myself and shake my head. That's surely not me.

"Welcome back to the game, brother," Isaac says as he lightly punches me on the shoulder and clicks the elevator button, "thanks man," I say, "and since when do you date?" I ask, as he leans his back on the flowery design wall. He never really dated girls. He always said he didn't want to give a girl any kind of hope that incorporates love. "Thought you never believed in love," I continue, "yeah, well sometimes things don't go as planned," he replies and smiles lowering his head, "what are you saying? You fell?" I ask astounded, not believing my ears. His smile broadens, "I can't believe this," I comment, "who is she?" I ask again, curious than ever. His smile fades as he straightens up to stand. "I'll let you guys meet her when she's ready," he answers, "when she's ready?" I laugh at his comment, "looks like she wrapped you up on her finger," I say, laughing at him. "Stop man, you know no girl wraps me up," he says smirking at me, "whom are you going on a date with by the way? Somebody I know?" He asks as we head to the cars. "Nope, you don't know her. She's not around here," I lie, not wanting anyone to know about us going on dates, "really? You dating a milf, man?" He mocks as he gets in his car, "later dude," I tell him, shutting down the subject and move into the street.

Chapter 13

"So, how did you find it?" I ask Ari as we exit Shake Shack, "I have to say, I'm definitely going to start visiting it," she replies, "You need to thank me for it," I say as we walk close to my vehicle, "Thank you very much, Abel," she says and smiles looking at me, doing her magic-trick again. "That's not how I want you to thank me," I tell her, "how do you want to thank me, then?" She asks, looking at me. I take her hand and pull her towards me, letting her lean against the vehicle and trap her between my arms, "what are you doing? There are people watching us," she says taken aback, "I don't really care," I say as I fight the feeling to take her down, "kiss me," I order, looking into her eyes, then at her beautifully arched, full lips. With not much hesitation, she crushes her lips to mine, taking me by surprise. I can't read her at all.

After a very short while, she pulls away, making me want for more, "we have to go," she says as she gets her breath back, "yeah, you're right," I say and move myself to open the passenger seat for her, "thanks," she says, more of a whisper.

"So, how's the business going?" She asks as I hand her a glass of red wine. I have told her about my business and how it is sloping upward, "It's going great," I reply, "when are you travelling?" She asks again, "in four days," I say and pour myself some too. "How long are you going to be in Rome?" She continues, "I'm hoping for one week, but if things don't go as planned, I might extend it to two," I say as I see her stare down on the floor for a little moment. What is she thinking about? "Are you going to miss me?" I ask and smirk at her, trying to take her off her thoughts, "I'll miss you just as much as you'll miss me," she smirks back. I laugh at her, she's getting better at this game than I am. "Wow, so you're going to miss me a lot," I tell her and she smiles and looks to the floor again, is she blushing? I laugh again, "what?" She asks confused, "nothing," I say and get up on my feet, "I'll be back, you can change into your pajamas until I come back," I say and head to the bedroom. I change into some comfy shorts and a white t-shirt and grab the movie I bought for this night from the drawer. "Wah Lah!" I show the cd box up on the air, "The Competition! The girls showed me the trailer the other day. It's not even out in movie theaters yet, how did you find it?" She expresses with a huge smile on her face, as I stand there taking in her bare thighs. She's wearing a silky, light khaki mini tank crop top with shorts nightwear, she must have done this deliberately, "that's a secret. Glad I got you something you desired," I say and move my way to switch it on the VCD, "the girls are going to flip out if I tell them I watched it," she says and laughs at herself, which makes me smile as I sit beside her and cover us with the knit blanket mom made me last Christmas. Her goofiness makes her look cute as hell, with her dimples. It's something I'm getting used to.

"Oh my God," she whispers, snatching me to reality, "it's so beautiful," she says still looking at the screen. I didn't get to see the whole movie, since my thoughts were on how her legs were so soft, as I kept my leg intact with her thighs. "Not more than you baby," I say, not being bothered of how forward I am. She turns and looks into my eyes, and spreads that familiar smile, not expecting what I said. I dare and lay my hand wide on her thigh under the blanket, she shivers a bit, "cold," she says and smiles at me. This can't get any more fantastic right now. I lean in to kiss her neck, and move my hand up and down her smooth leg. I listen to her breathing deeply, I'm sure she's liking it, that thought makes me smile. Tonight, is my lucky night! I kiss her luscious lips and slide up my hand up her leg, and untie her ponytail with my other hand. She lets a moan escape from her, which lets something erupt inside me. I move back and slowly, yet rapidly unfold her legs and let her lay back on the couch. I spread her legs so I have enough space to lay on top of her. I kiss her slow and press myself onto her, making her groan as she moves her hands and grabs my hair. That silky nightwear got to be the best right now, causing me to feel her more. I kiss and suck her earlobes, then down her neck, "stop, stop," she says and tries to push me away from her, "why?" I say and take her hands from my chest and place it on top of her head and continue to kiss her neck, "I know you want this as much as I do. Don't resist it," I say in an attempt to persuade her, I press myself in her, deep this time, as she lets out a good moan. I've never enjoyed dry humping this much, it never got this far. "No, stop, I'm serious," she says again, as frustration gets me, "what?" I say in a low voice, "you don't like it?" I ask puzzled, "it's not like that," she says looking into my eyes, "then what?" I ask again, "I don't want to do this right now, I'm not ready," she says as I see some kind of fear in her eyes. I move myself from her and sit, as she does the same, "I'm sorry," I say, not understanding what she meant by what she said, "it's getting late, you should head to bed," I say, angry that it didn't go as planned, "okay," she says and gets up, "goodnight," she speaks, "night," I reply back. I hear footsteps, then the bedroom door shut close. I switch off the lights and lay down with my blue balls. It's been ages since I had blue balls. And it's definitely not pleasant.

"Good morning," I hear her voice from afar, "you awake yet?" She asks, I blink my eyes open and stretch my muscles, "yeah," I answer and get up from the couch. I see her, looking sexy as ever, with her hair tied up, wearing dark blue jeans and a long sleeve, off shoulder, denim t shirt tucked under. "I see you're up early," I say, "yeah, decided to make breakfast," she tells me, "you made breakfast? How come I didn't hear you?" I ask muddled, "I tried to be as quite as possible," she answers, "and I guess it worked," she says and smiles at me. That beautiful smile again. I head to the bedroom, "going to take a quick shower, don't eat without me," I say playfully as she laughs. "Listen," she announces, making me stop from my pace and turn to look at her, "I want to say I'm sorry, about yesterday," she begins, "no, stop," I cut her off as I move my way back to her, "there's no need for you to say sorry. It just wasn't the right time," I tell her, not making her feel guilty. "Yeah, I saw you were angry, I didn't mean to," "shush," I cut her off again, placing my finger on her lips, "I understand. I'm sorry that I got all upset. It's because it never happened to me. But I get it now, I don't want to rush you into things," I reassure her, "okay?" I say, "okay," she replies and smiles up at me, making my heart melt. I'm not understanding where this is going. "Go, finish up, I'm starving," she says and pushes me with her tiny hands, "alright, alright. Promise me you won't eat behind me though," I say squinting my eyes playfully, "I promise," she says with her hand up, I laugh and head to the bedroom.

"Thanks for everything," she says, after I parked the car outside of her building, "the pleasure is all mine, beautiful. We should do it more often," I say with a smirk, thinking of the couch incident. "Have fun on your trip," she says before she opens the car door, "I'll be thinking of you," I say and instantly regret it, she smiles and says, "me too," and closes the door and heads to the building, leaving me with a huge, goofy smile plastered on my face.

Chapter 14

I sit at the airport lounge with my regular chai latte from Starbucks and look at some magazines on the coffee table, as I wait for Mr. Glader. A ding on my phone distracts me from looking at some house furniture, 'safe flight handsome.' This is the first time I see Ari sweet text me, which causes a grin on my face, "you better tell her you would be back soon," I look up and see Mr. Glader sit on the seat next to me, "yeah, it's just a friend," I say as I put the phone back in my pocket, "I don't know why you young boys are afraid of love nowadays," he says, I laugh at the comment, "who said I'm afraid," I say, "I've been married for twenty six years now, I saw how you looked at the phone," he speaks, which makes me laugh again, "I wouldn't say I'm in love," I say, as the boarding call on the public announcement system asks travelers to proceed to the exit gate and board the aircraft. "That's what you think Zarger. I think our flight is here," he orders, and we get up and head to the gate.

I finally lay down after a long day of working. It's been two days now since I left home, since I left her. I didn't have time to even text her as I started work right after I got to the Radisson Blu Hotel, trying my best to go back home last day of this week. I get my phone and click on the name Ari, "hello," she says, I missed her voice, "hey," I reply, "how was the flight?" She asks, "it was okay. I still haven't had enough rest since I got here," I say, feeling like a teenage boy, "got a little worried, you know," she says, which took me by surprise, "really?" I say in a husky voice, "yeah," she says, and we stay silent for about a minute, "I miss you," I finally break the ice, "me too," she replies, why do I feel like she's blushing right now! I smile at the thought. "When will you be back?" She asks, "don't know yet. But I'm trying my best to come back this week," I say to make her feel secure somehow. Not knowing why I should make her feel that way. "So, how's Rome?" She asks again, "it's a bit chill out, but it is beautiful. Haven't had much time to see the city yet," I fill her in, "is it like in the movies? The narrow streets, the people all touchy-feely," she says, which makes me laugh. I've never had a girl make me laugh as much as her, "Yeah, the narrow streets are real and the people, well, some can be touchy-feely," I reply, "Ah, that's so beautiful," she comments, "I got to go now, the girls are going to be here any minute," she says, "alright, give my regards to Samri," I tell her, "not funny," she says and I laugh at the comment. We say our goodbyes and close the phone, and I drift off to sleep thinking of her smiles and dimples.

I decide to have my breakfast downstairs, as I haven't seen the restaurant since I got here. After a long hot shower, I change into black, urban classics pants with navy blue, muscle fit crew neck t shirt and head to the restaurant. I finish my halloumi and beef carpaccio salad and pecorino cheese flakes, taking in the bright sun and enjoying the buzz of the place full of people. I pay the bill and check the time on my watch, I got about fifteen minutes to get ready and head to work. I get up from my seat and head out the door, when all of a sudden, I hear, "well, we meet again," behind me and I freeze in my step. I know this voice so well, I want to turn and look at her, but I don't want to at the same time. Lastly, I turn and see that familiar face, I see Her, "hello Jessica, it's nice to see you again," I greet unwillingly, not believing what I am seeing. "What are you doing here?" She asks with a broad smile, a smile which always dinged my heart, "I'm here for work. What about you?" I ask back, "I came with the girls," she says, pointing out to the seats with five girls, "to get away from the real world," she continues. "That's nice. Well, I got to head to work now. It was nice seeing you again, Jessica," I announce and start to move my way, but a sudden grip on my arm stops me, "can I talk to you for a sec?" She asks with her pleading eyes, as always. I convince myself not to fall for it, "I have not time now, Jess," I reply, "please Abel, please just for one sec," she begs. I take five seconds before I said, "okay, but not now. I'll eat dinner here tonight at seven," I say and she cuts me off, "great, I'll be here. I'm staying at this hotel too." What are the odds? She staying here at the same time I am. Can this get any worse? "See you then," I say and leave. I have all these mixed feelings inside me as I change up in my suit. She looked beautiful, or maybe it's because I missed her. Her voice hasn't changed, her body is something I miss so much. I need to distract myself and stop thinking of her. I grab my case and head to the take-home vehicle.

I spend the whole day at work, thinking of her. What does she want from me? Did she realize she misses me now? Or maybe she and her douchebag boyfriend are done, and now she's bored and wants someone to play with. I force myself to get distracted by having a chat with the employees.

Chapter 15

After a cold shower, I head to dinner downstairs. As I move my way, searching for a better spot, I see Her. She glances up from the menu in her hand and waves at me. "Good evening," I greet after I reached her table, "good evening," she says and shows off her tooth piercing as she smiles. "You're here early," I remark and sit opposite to her, "yeah, I arrived here before fifteen minutes," she says, "I'm starving, what are you getting?" She asks, I can hear the nervousness in her voice, "I'm not sure," I reply as I take a look at the menu in front of me. The waiter approaches us to take our order, "can I have the sliced ribeye steak served with wild rocket salad and Grana Padano cheese flakes, and a red wine please?" She orders, "yes ma'am," he writes on his little notebook, "and I'll just have a burger with a red wine," I say, and the waiter nods and scurries off. "So," she says and rests her elbows on the table, moving forward to my side, "what's new? It's been ages," she continues simply, "I'm not here to talk about what's new or old, Jessica," I tell her, "yeah, you're right. I wanted to see you because I want to say sorry," she begins, which makes me smile at her statement, which is so absurd, "I miss you, Abel," she says and touches my hand laying on the table, "I know I made a mistake, but I want to fix this, fix us," she continues, "give me a chance to prove it to you. Give me a chance to show you my true love. You know well that a perfect relationship has battles, give me one more chance to make us live again," she says. I take a sec to absorb those words, "why now?" I ask plainly, "I tried. I tried so many times to reach you but you changed your number. I even wanted to show up at your apartment, but I stopped myself," she replies, "I was scared that you wouldn't want to see me ever again," she says and wipes a tear off. I don't know where my thoughts disappeared, my head is just a complete blank as I lay in bed after a quite dinner with her. She wants us back. Why do I feel a little happy deep inside me? I never believed in second chances. Seeing the boys in the past years, it never went better for them. A ding grasps my attention, I check the text on my phone, 'just finished The Competition with the girls, with you in my mind,' this just can't get any worse! How did I forget about Ari! 'I bet you enjoyed it more with me *wink*,' I send, 'goodnight Mr. Zarger,' she texts, which makes me smile thinking of her blushing again, 'goodnight beautiful,' I type and send.

I spend the next two days working hard with Mr. Glader, "I guess we can finally get back home tomorrow evening," he says, "yeah, looks like it," I comment, "I must say, you have done a fantastic job Zarger. I knew I wasn't wrong about you," he says and pats my shoulder, "thank you, sir. I'm glad you are a fond of it," I say, "why don't we have some beers tonight, on me. It's not a request, it's an order," he says and smiles, "whatever you say, sir," I reply and we head to our hotel.

I open the door to my room after I had a little too many to drink. My vision is a little blurry, my body feels like I ran on a marathon for two days, so I let myself lay on the bed and close my eyes. I hear the door open, but I ignore it, feeling so tired and sleepy. I feel my bed lower a little because of the weight on the bed. I open my eyes a bit and see Her. "What are you doing? You're not supposed to be here," I say in a very lazy voice, "I came here to see if you needed any help," she replies, I take a look at her and her clothing, a sexy, black lace nightgown, "this is not right, Jess. I need to rest, so if you please," I tell her and she comes very close to my side and whispers in my ear, "I miss you, so much. I know you miss me too," she starts to rub on my chest, "don't fight this, give us another chance," she says and starts to unbutton my shirt. God, she smells good, I do miss her, but there's something holding me back. She starts to kiss me, goes down licking my neck, then back up sucking my ear and opens up my belt with her hands. This feels insane. "Stop," I tell her, more of a whisper, "I know you want this, babe," she insists. It gets hard to focus which makes me no longer see anything but darkness.

I hear my phone ring, so I force myself to get up from bed to search for my phone. I realize I have no pants on except for my boxers, I turn back and look at the bed and cannot believe my eyes, I see Her sleeping calmly on the other side. I start to curse myself with no sound and search for my phone, I finally get it inside my pants. I see Ari on the screen, how did I forget about her? "Hey," I whisper picking up the call, "hey you, did you lose your phone? I texted you many times," she says, "umm, I was just a little busy with work, I haven't got the chance to look at the phone, sorry babe," I say in a very low voice. "Why are you whispering? Are you busy?" She asks, "yes, I am in a last meeting right now, I'll call you back after I'm done," I reply, "okay, I'll be waiting," she says, "oh, and before I forget, I'm coming back home this evening. What do you say if we hang out tomorrow night, at my place?" I ask with a broad smile on my face, "we'll wait and see, Mr. Zarger," she replies, "is that a yes?" I ask again, "call me later," she says as I hear some guy calling out her name, "okay," I say and she hangs up. Why did she hang up so fast? And who is this guy? I start to vision her being with someone else, making myself in an angry mode. "You got a new girl now?" She asks, grabbing my attention, "that does not matter right now. What the fuck happened yesterday?" I ask confused, "what? You don't remember?" She asks, looking a little taken aback, "yeah, that's why I'm asking you, dammit," I say, taking out my anger on her. "Chill, nothing happened. You slept before we could do anything," she confesses. Relief washes all over me, as I sit on the bed, "listen Jess, we had a great time together. I wouldn't want change that, ever. But that is always going to be in the past," I tell her while I give her my back. "I don't believe in second chances, you know that," I continue, "I forgive you for what you did. I believe that as humans, we make mistakes that are either big or small, but I don't feel the same way about you as I did before. I don't want to hurt you, but you also need to know the truth about my feelings," I lay out after a lot of thinking, "so you're not going to give us another chance?" She asks as I hear her sniff, "not now, Jess. I'm sorry" I reply and come closer to hug her. "Anyway, I got to go. I have some things to do," she says removing herself from the bed before I could touch her, and slams the door behind her. "Well that went well," I say to myself and head in the bathroom to get ready for my flight.

Chapter 16

It's been two days since I arrived home. It's colder now. I haven't rung Ari. I've been thinking about Jess a lot. About what she said. Am I wrong for not giving her another chance? She's more beautiful than ever. I miss her laughs, I miss her smell, I miss the way she fed me from my plate, but cooking is not for her good habits. After all the frustration I had because of her, Ari eradicated it. She gave me peace, she made me laugh again. She is silly, but in a cute way. Sexy in her own way too. Her body is to die for. I don't want to compare them, but they hold a good place in my heart. A ring makes me swirl my chair to the phone next to me, "yes?" I reply, "Mr. Zarger, Brittany from Hope magazine is here to see you," Helen says, "let her in," I order, "yes sir," she says and hangs up. Seconds later, I see a beautiful, dark hair, chubby-faced young lady come inside my office after knocking the door, "hello, Mr. Zarger. I'm Brittany from Hope magazine," she introduces while shaking my hand, "nice to meet you, Brittany. Please sit," I say ushering to the seat beside her, "would you like something to drink?" I ask, "coffee with no sugar, please," she answers.

We take about two hours with the interview, and we shake hands and say our final goodbyes. I chose Hope from the other magazines because it simply reflected my phase in this business life. When I thought I was failing in this business, hope was the only thing that made me go on. After two years of hard work, but with no progress in the business lifestyle, my hope was the only thing holding me up on my feet. And here I am. Just when I thought I completely failed; opportunity came knocking to my door. After that day, nothing was the same anymore. I have about three hundred workers now, after I expanded my business to architecting and building. I also have my new business partners, Samuel and Nina. Samuel is one of the best upcoming workers in the construction industry, whereas Nina's popularity comes from her fabulous interior designs.

I finally get home after a busy day at work. I take off my shoes and my blazer off and pop a champagne bottle. I dial mom on the phone, "hello darling," she says, "hey mom," I say, "what's wrong? You sound a little off," she says, as if reading my mind, "I'm fine mom, just tired," I tell her, not giving away my thoughts, "go easy on yourself, sweetie," she says, "yeah. How's dad?" I ask, "he's good. How was Rome?" She asks back, "it is surely beautiful," I answer, "indeed, it is," she says. Mom and dad always loved travelling. I remember them leaving us at grandma's when we were kids, before she passed away, just to travel the world. They never stopped. We've travelled with them a few times, but it used to get boring for us since we had no friends come along. "Darling, we'll be waiting for you this Saturday at our house," she says, "but I thought you were travelling to Singapore this weekend," I say unnotified, "we changed our plans. I've already informed your sister," she says simply, "alright, will be there," I tell her and we hang off after our goodbyes.

After a few glasses of champagne, I take the phone out of my pocket and text Ari, 'hey beautiful.' I wonder if she has been thinking of me since the last time we talked. She didn't text or call after that day, and I might know why. I'm sure she thinks I'm giving her the cold shoulder, but the thoughts of Jess couldn't distance from me. It's like I'm getting back to my bubble of frustration. 'hey you,' she texts back, 'I missed you,' I send. I do miss her. 'Really?' She texts back, which makes me smile as I think of her squinting, 'truly. Didn't you?' I press send, waiting for her obvious answer, 'well, not so much,' I read. It feels like a bullet scratched my heart, 'that's not the answer I expected,' I text. Does she not miss me at all? Did I push her away not realizing? I drift off to sleep waiting for her answer the rest of the night.

After a hectic day distracting myself with work, trying to keep away the thoughts of Ari not texting me back yesterday, which is also something that never happened to me, I decide to pop up at her dorm building. 'I'm downstairs,' I press send, as I see some guys dropping off three girls of a Chevy Tahoe. "Yo T, let Ari know I'm pissed because she didn't come, alright?" I see a brown-haired guy driving the car say out loud, "got it," one of the girls shouts back. A ding makes me look at the phone, 'I'm not home,' she texts back. I remember the guy saying that he was pissed off because she didn't come, how come she's saying that she isn't home? Is she lying to me? Does she not want to see me? Maybe she is seeing somebody else now? I remember a guy calling her out and made her hang up the phone while she was talking to me when I was in Rome. 'Alright,' I send. Or maybe she's just out. I might be overthinking things.

I head to Joseph's place the next night, as it has been long since I didn't get to see the guys. "Man, you have no idea how popular you are," Isaac says as he shows me his phone, "yeah, just had that interview today," I comment, "work has been hectic. I want to take a break from this life a bit," I confess. I want to take a break from work, Jess, and Ari. Ari never left my mind since yesterday. And she didn't text me at all today. "Doesn't your girl make you relax a bit?" Isaac reveals. I forgot that I even told him about Ari. "What girl? Wait, you're with someone?" Joseph asks, "I'm not with her, just went on some dates," I tell, "who is she?" He asks again, "he doesn't want to say. He said you'll get to meet her later or something. I think she's a cougar," Isaac remarks. "Shut up man, you'll get to meet her, one day," I say, not knowing how this conversation came about Ari. "She must be special, since it's been long you haven't dated," Joseph says, I remember they didn't know about Jess. "I got to head home, got work tomorrow," I get up from my seat, "you're acting like your wife is bossing you around, I'm sure she's the one giving you the curfew," Isaac comments, making me ignore it, "alright man," Joseph says as I head out.

Chapter 17

I get a text from Samri while I work, 'just saw this online today,' with a picture of me on Hope magazine, 'looking handsome as ever,' I text back, 'ugh, whatever,' she texts, 'see you this weekend,' I send her with the kiss emoji and spend the rest of the day working like a dog. I get home tired, and get fast asleep. I see her working with bricks. I've never seen her this way before. I can't read her, "what are you doing, Ari?" I ask from afar, "don't come any closer," she commands with gritted teeth. I don't say anything as I watch her build a structure, separating me from her. I dare and take one step toward her, as I realize what she is up to, "stop!" She shouts, which makes me freeze in my place, I've never seen her this aggrieved, "don't, please," I beg and she irritatedly smirks at me. I feel an existence beside me, which forces me to look at her, "hey baby," she says and gives me a peck on the cheek. "You guys deserve each other," I hear Ari say, "no babe, I'm done with her. Forgive me, please," I beg again, as she continues to build her wall up. I wake up to my alarm, with a beating heart. What was that all about? Why was Ari this angry? Why was Jess in my dream?

I text the guys to come over to my place to watch the game tonight, before I sign off the papers that Helen brought. A knock captures my attention, "Mr. Glader is here to see you," Helen says, "great! Take these papers and send him in please," I tell her. "We have a problem, Zarger," Mr. Glader declares, "what problem?" I ask, not expecting a problem. "I changed my mind on the south area project. I want to expand it more," he announces, taking me by surprise. "We have already started the project, Mr. Glader," I say, not knowing how to change his mind, "that's why I said we have a problem," he says simply, "I'm sure you can fix it," he continues. "Can we do another project with your new idea, rather than destroy what we already built?" I ask, knowing exactly what he would answer, "I'm afraid not, Zarger," he says undefeated. "I'll see we can do," I say, trying to figure out how to break it down to Samuel.

I head home after working things out with Samuel. On the road, I decide to switch my path towards her college, I miss her. I didn't see her since the day I came. I park my car in front of her building, hoping to get a glimpse of her. I see people going in and out of the building, but no sign of her. I wish I knew which room she was in; I would've seen her by the windows. I've been inside only once, when we dropped Samri off on her first day. I see girls getting off a taxi, and I see her. Gosh, she looks beautiful than ever, wearing tight, cropped dark blue jeans, making her bum beautifully arched, with a white shirt underneath her white blazer. She stops and looks to my side; did she notice my car? I duck my head down for her not to see me. How embarrassing! I punch my head, irritated. What made me do this? I slowly watch her as she talks to one of the girls, not changing her position. What is making them stand there? Is she telling the girl that she saw me? I doubt that. She wouldn't want to jeopardize her friendship. I know how much they love each other. I see them walk in further, letting me breathe to ease my anxiety.

"Yes! Yes! Yes!" Isaac shouts, "touch down baby," he shouts, as his team wins. "Great luck, dude," Joseph says, "it's not luck man, that's how we do. Better luck next time," he answers him with a pat on his shoulder, "shut up man," I comment, and he laughs. "Which reminds me, there's a party tomorrow night," he says, "whose?" I ask, and Joseph starts to cough after taking a sip of his beer, "someone you don't know," Isaac says eyeing at Joseph. I sense there is something the want to tell me, "what? You guys are being weird," I state, "you going to come along or what?" Isaac asks, ignoring my comment, "nah man, I got to go to the folks tomorrow," I tell him. We spend the rest of the night talking about work, and girls as usual.

Chapter 18

I put on my dark blue jeans which matches my scarf, a light brown sweater with a dark coat. I spray some Versace on me and head out to the car. I park outside the house, I don't see Samri's car, which is weird because she always gets here first. I lock my car and look up at the house as I walk up the stairs, and I realize the lights are off. I wonder what might have happened inside, I walk faster to the doorstep and open the door, I feel like my ears are about to explode when I hear, "surprise," said out loud in the darkness. Suddenly, the lights are switched on and I could see the people gathered up further in the room. I laugh at the birthday surprise with my hand on my chest, trying to ease my heart from bursting. How did I forget my freaking birthday?! Mom comes up to me, giving me a hug and a kiss, "happy twenty eighth birthday darling," she says in my ear, "you got me, mom," I tell her, making her smile, "I know," she replies. "Happy birthday son," dad comes up and gives me a hug, and Samri kisses me on the cheek, "my present is in your room," she says and winks. The guys come up and greet me, "so this was the party you guys were going to tonight, huh? I ask them, "hell yes," Isaac replies, which makes us laugh at his comment. "Well darling, we must get going," she says, giving me one last hug and goes to her bedroom, "where to?" I ask eyeing dad, "Singapore," he says, "you didn't think your mother would cancel her plan, did you?" He says, "right. Well, have fun," I say and hug dad before he goes out the house. "Take care not to break anything," mom orders before shutting the door.

We pop a bottle and start to drink, "I'm going to leave you guys, I smell girls all over here," Isaac says and heads to the blasting music, "I got to get going, dude. I invited Linda, she's waiting for me," Joseph says and gets up from his seat, "what? You guys are together now?" I ask him surprised, "taking it step by step, dude," he replies and steps away.

I head out to the dancefloor, and see her, with some guy. Who invited her here? Then, I remember Samri. Of course, she invited her. And who is this guy? Is he the one who was calling her out when she was on the phone with me? The alcohol starts to sink in and I decide to walk up to her. Remembering the day when I purposely spilled the drink on the guy. "Do you mind if I talk to this beautiful lady for a sec?" I ask the guy politely, "sure," he says and winks at her before he leaves us alone, making me want to smack him. "Why haven't you answered my texts?" I ask, getting right to the point, "I've been busy with school," she answers, "so you couldn't write a word at least?" I ask again, wanting to know what made her so distant, "we don't need to get into this. It's your birthday, you should be having fun," she replies, "let me have fun then," I tell her, "how?" she asks, challenging me again. This is the Ari I'm familiar with. I take her hand and lead her to a guest room in the hallway. I push her in and lock the door. This is it. I want her. Everything. I close the space separating me from her, and start to kiss her, hard, taking out all my emotions. She kisses me back, and helps me remove my sweater. A loud bump in the toilet makes us stop, "oh my God," Ari says, startled by the sound, "hold on, let me switch on the lights," I tell her. I force my inner self from her embrace, turn on the lights and head to the toilet. I open the door, and I feel like a knife stabbing me in the chest non-stop. I can't believe my eyes, it's like they're cheating on me, "what the fuck?" I say out loud with full rage, as I see Isaac with red lipstick smudged all over his lips and neck, staring at me. I feel Ari standing behind me, "it's not what you think," Samri says, looking fearful as ever, "nah man, hear me out," Isaac says coming closer to me, and in a swift, I see Isaac on the floor bleeding, after punching him right in the nose.

To be continued.
