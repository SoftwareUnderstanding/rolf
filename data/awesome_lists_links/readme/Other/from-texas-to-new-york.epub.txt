About this Collection

This collection of stories is uninspired by some of the bone-headed things I've seen in my life. Bureaucracy in its purest form is almost impossible to navigate. Just look at any government and try to get a straight honest answer from them. Wait a few days and put to them the same question and compare the answers. For further proof ask them again in a few more days. However, beware if you live under a totalitarian government, they may be knocking or breaking down your door.

No matter how bad any situation seems, it could be worse. I wish to acknowledgment and thank the writers of the Constitution of the United States, the teachers I had in school, the men and women I've known, and last but not least my loving wife of forty-four years.

Prologue

The beginning of this story is fiction and I hope it remains so! It wasn't until modern times that an army was deliberately disarmed when it returned to its country of origin.

Governments that are afraid of their military forces disarm them. That way they can control them. Soldiers are trained to obey the lawful orders of those appointed over them.

Governments that are afraid of their citizens do everything they can to disarm them. Gun registration, background checks, and gun free zones are a few of the early indicators.

Having law abiding citizens with no weapons create a **target rich environment** for armed criminals. It also creates a **target rich environment** for an enemy whether domestic or foreign.

A national border that is easily crossed is asking for problems. One of the laws of nature dictates that a vacuum will be filled. What fills the vacuum at the southern border of this country is something that the beginning of this story assumes could happen, but I hope not!

This is not an essay on border security or gun control, but a story of possibilities.

Chapter 1 That shouldn't be happening

First thing I was aware of was the floor coming at me. As I shook my head I realized that someone had dumped my bunk over. Having the top bunk had it's advantages, sometimes.

Some scoundrel was yelling, "Get your asses up and gear up. Formation in 10 out front, full riot gear."

Stumbling out into the dark I heard trucks arriving. "Load up by squads" came a roar. A few minutes later we were bouncing around like bowling pins after a strike. Suddenly fear clutched my heart as we tumbled to the front of the truck and someone dropped the tailgate and started shoving rifles into the truck. A wooden box, I recognized as magazines followed. Then a few green cans of ammo landed with a crash. A Corporal climbed in as the tailgate slammed up and the truck lurched forward.

His first words were, "Get that ammo and start loading magazines. We got no time to waste."

Fear really grabbed me because Fort Hood was in the middle of Texas, not some dangerous part of the world. Scrambling back I grabbed the clips on the magazine box and twisted them popped the lid up. As I grabbed several magazines hands started reaching over my shoulder, so I lifted my hand and passed them back. Soon my hand hit the bottom and I was able to grab several for myself. Someone grabbed the corner of the box and dragged it over my leg and I heard a box of ammo being dumped into the magazine box. Twisting I grabbed a few boxes. Spotting a loader clip in the bottom I snagged it and twisted until my back was against the tailgate and started loading my magazines. Loose rounds were rolling around on the bed of the truck and I saw an unopened box of rounds by my right foot. As I reached for it the corporal's foot hooked it and looking into his eyes I realized that he was as fearful as the rest of us.

A few minutes later we heard a voice from the cab yelling at us to be at ease and listen up. He then told us that there was a situation in Belton. A mob had stormed the jail complex and released the prisoners. Another mob had taken over the courthouse and were shooting everyone in sight. The mayor and local police chief called the governor and he'd called out the state police. After half of the police had been killed he called out the Texas National Guard. Their local commander had called for his people to report, but told the governor that it would be a day before he could get a sufficient force in place to contain the mobs. When mobs attacked the capitol in Austin the governor had called the Ft. Hood commander and demanded support. Only then did he discover that this terrorist action was happening all over the country. The President had issued a national state of emergency shortly before a rocket blasted it's way through the oval office wall and killed everyone there. Some General in the Pentagon issued a full alert the orders stated in no uncertain terms that the military would restore order. Our rules of engagement stated that when fired upon we were to eliminate all enemy combatants. We would be in Belton in a few minutes, and form up by squads.

Suddenly we were all sliding toward the front of the truck as I head what sounded like a machine gun. A line of little holes appeared from the front of the canvas and ran down the sides. The corporal was laying on the side bench. I could see blood running down the side of the truck bed and toward me. I snagged an M-16 and slapped in a magazine. Even thought I knew I wasn't the ranking squad member I shouted, "Grab a weapon, lock and load. As soon as this truck stops everyone out and get down on the ground. Anyone firing at us, kill them."

I heard someone cry, "You ain't in charge."

I yelled back, "The corporal is dead, and I don't think anyone up front is going to object to my order." Just then the truck slammed into something and we all tumbled to the front again. I lost my weapon and started searching for another as guys were jumping over the tailgate. Shoving the dead corporal off my legs I unhooked his web belt and fastened it over my shoulder. Then I spotted a weapon and snagged it. Jumping over the tailgate I hooked a toe and landed flat on my face. Looking to my right I could see another truck that had crashed into a house. Tapping the leg by head I saw him react and start to swing his weapon toward me. In as calm a voice as I could manage, I told him to crawl over to the other truck and see if anyone was alive. If they were get them off and get them back over here. Take someone with you. He mumbled something so I hollered, "Move it soldier and tell everyone you pass what you're doing so they can cover you."

Looking then to my left I saw several guys laying in bushes and several hiding in a hedge. Crawling toward them I yelled for two of them to crawl back to me. Two privates arrived as I was tipping over a few lawn chairs to block a view of the road behind the truck. Twisting I could see the truck jammed up against a car that it'd shoved into a garage door. Looking at the first private to arrive, I told him, "Starting back where you were, crawl to the left and tell everyone to find cover and make a perimeter. Anyone approaching should be told to identify themselves. There was one truck behind us, we need to make sure it's our guys before we let them into our perimeter. OK move out and then report back to me how many guys you told and where they are." I repeated my instructions to the other private, except he was to go to the right. I added, "If you find any NCOs or officers tell them to report back here. Now move out."

Looking around I saw a short brick wall with a BBQ grill not twenty feet to my left. Crawling over to it I found a SP4 whimpering beside the grill. Slapping him got his attention. As he started to sit up I grabbed his arm and jerked him toward me saying, "I need you to crawl over to the house and check it out. Grab that of the PFC over there and check all the rooms. Make sure anyone there are civilians. Have one of them come out here and report to me. If there ain't no one in the house make sure the front doors are locked and report back to me. Send the other PFC over to me. Now move it."

As a SP5 driver I knew I only had so much authority. Hopefully they'd find an NCO or officer to take charge.

A few minutes later several guys crawled through the opening in the brick wall and over to me. One said, "I found these guys alive in the other truck, we got some of the ammo and magazines. Most of the rifles were destroyed because someone threw a grenade in the back. There is a sergeant in front, but he's shot in the chest.

Thinking, I stated, "OK, take these guys and get that sergeant over here. While you're over there throw all the ammo you can back in the box and bring it along with all the magazines and weapons you can carry. There are probably a few of our guys still out there from the other truck, so use your common sense if you see anyone. Anyone not in uniform, make sure they ain't armed before you bring them in. If there's a radio in the cab, bring it also. Move out."

The SP4 from the house ran over and said all they'd found in the house were dead bodies. All had their throats cut. I told him to setup on the second floor looking out the front and keep watch. Anyone approaching should be identified and he could send out the PFC to check their IDs before allowing them inside our perimeter.

My knee was feeling better so I started off in the opposite direction until I found the first member of our squad that I knew. He was a cook. I told him to follow me. As we came upon several soldiers whispering behind the hedge I told them to shut-up and listen. You two move over by that tree and dig a shallow trench for cover. Your field of fire will be in front of here to where you see me set the next guys. You two dig in here and keep an eye on the driveway. Set your fields of fire from in front of the tree to the the road. The last guy I told to follow me. In a crouch I ran past the tree and curved back toward the house. We picked up one more guy and I found a crepe myrtle patch. I told them to dig in behind the crepe myrtle and their field of fire would be from in front of the tree to the front corner of the house. If I can find anyone over there I'll have them dig in, so watch me and adjust your fields of fire. If I don't you have to keep an eye on the whole area. Pulling my notebook from my pocket I made a quick sketch of the area. Then we started off toward the corner of the house. Concealed behind another bush we found two more privates, so I told them to follow me. Whoever lived here liked their bushes spread out so I found another and told them to dig a trench for cover behind the bush and their fields of fire would be from the last position to the corner of the house. Turning back toward the last position I pointed down and then held my arms out showing where this positions field of fire would be. One of the guys back there did the same. At least his arm pointing in my direction wasn't pointed behind us. Reaching the corner of the house I peeked around front hoping to see the other truck and some more soldiers. No such luck. Then my cook and I ran back toward the back of the house and around the corner on the the roadside. Spotting several guys I headed over to where they were.

When we got there I moved them to better positions and told them to dig in. After setting their fields of fire I asked them if they'd seen anyone between them and the road. They said they'd seen several guys between them and the road. I sent one of them to get them and bring them back. I heard him tell them that SP5 Kenric wanted them back toward the house. Just before they reached my position I yelled, "Halt and identify yourselves."

From the cursing I knew they were from our group. Then I said, "Is everyone in your group known to everyone else, no strangers" When they said yes I told them to come on in. I recognized two of the mechanics and several drivers, but one guy I didn't know. Pointing my M16 at him I asked him who he was. One of the mechanics piped up that he knew him, he'd just signed in yesterday. I told the stranger to undo his web belt and drop his weapon. Instead he grabbed a grenade off his belt, so I shot him on full auto. The grenade flew over his head and back toward the road. I yelled down and dropped flat just before the grenade went off. The guy laying beside me stuck his weapon in my side and said, "You just killed him."

I then stated, "We weren't issued grenades, someone disarm him and check him for ID."

My cook took my .45 and went over and unhooked the guys web gear and rolled him off it. Then he reached into the guys pocked and open his wallet. Then he announced, "No military ID, just a drivers license and lots of money. No dog tags around his neck, just this weird emblem. Let Kenric up, I don't think this guy is one of us."

I then got up and walked forward and took back my .45. Looking down I simply stated, "Anyone you don't know from back on post, don't trust until you verify that they are one of us period." One of the mechanics didn't get up so I walked over to him and rolled him over. The whole front of his body was covered with blood. I reached down and jerked his dog tags off. Sticking one in my pocket I stuck the other in his mouth and jammed his jaw shut wedging it between his teeth. I heard gagging from my left. Turning I simply said, "We need to be able to identify the body for later recovery. Get their gear and move their bodies out to that tree by the road. Anybody you see out there, verify their identity and bring them back. If you don't know them take their weapons before allowing them back here. Tapping two of them, I told them to dig a shallow trench for cover and their field of fire would be from the bush on their right to the bush on their left.

One of them said, "I'm not digging a hole in someones front yard."

I realized that it was the company clerk. Turning to her, I told her, "Whoever started those riots don't care that you are woman, they will simply kill or rape you because you don't belong to their group. Act like the soldier you are, or take off the uniform and walk. I don't think you'll stand a chance out there because all the civilians we've found so far have been butchered."

With a shocked look on her face she whispered, "I need a shovel and a gun."

"Take the dead mechanic's rifle and entrenching tool. Sorry, but they're the only spares at the present time."

The other guys were back so I took them over to the next position and told them to dig in and assigned them fields of fire. The last two I positioned so their field of fire was down the side of the house and back to the last position. Taking the web gear from the intruder I headed back to the BBQ patio checking each position and telling them that I'd send relief as soon as we had more soldiers rounded up. Back at the pit I found the guys I sent over to the other truck. They looked sick, but the sergeant leaned against the wall was instructing a soldier on how to place a field dressing on his shoulder. Looking at my cook I told him to find any other cooks and then check the house for food. We need food for about 30. If there isn't enough check back with me and we'll check some other houses. I then turned to the remaining three soldiers and said, "Dig in a position between here and the truck," and pointed over to my left. "You'll be the relief and security squad. That means I'll be sending you where you're needed. No questions, move it."

The sergeant just sat there and looked at me. Then he commented, "Ever seen combat?"

"No," I said, "but I just had to kill a guy on the other side of the house."

"Any other NCOs or officers survive the ambush?

"You're the only one so far, we haven't located any other trucks yet," I said as I pointed toward the two.

He then said, "There were four trucks in the group, I was in the third so I assume you were in the second. What is this platoon made up of?"

"So far as I know, a couple of mechanics, a dozen drivers, one cook that I know of, and a clerk that's female. I've set up a loose perimeter around the back and this side of the house, two guys in the house plus the cook, and as you just heard a relief force of three. Is the radio working and what should we do now?"

He looked at me and with a chuckle said, "Don't tell anyone but I'm personnel, never seen a day in a combat zone, and never killed anyone. You're doing a good job as far as I can tell, so you keep it up. I'll back you up suggest anything that I can think of. Consider me a butter bar as far as experience goes.

"Now for the radio, it's got holes in it because I was using it as a headrest when we were ambushed. I suggest that we get the troops fed and watered. Then just before dusk we move to another location. You probably should send two soldiers out to scout the neighborhood and locate us another house we can spend the night in. Also have a mechanic check out both trucks and see if we can get one operational. Since we can't complete our mission we need to locate the others that were sent to Belton. Captain James was in charge, but I have no idea who is now."

After a few minutes I called one of the relief soldiers over and told him to go around to the far front corner and bring the two soldiers from there back here. Also tell the next position that they need to cover that positions field of fire. I then walked over to the remaining two relief soldiers and told the private to start checking the positions. When he found the SP5 mechanic he was to tell him to report to me and take up his perimeter position.

When everyone got back, I sent the mechanic to check out our truck. The other four I gave the following instructions to. "In pairs I want you to check out the neighborhood. Stay far enough apart so you can cover each other. One moves forward while the other covers him. A bush ain't cover, however a tree or wall is. If you run into any soldiers, check their ID before exposing both of yourselves. Only after you're absolutely sure their Ft. Hood soldiers and friendly are you to send them back to our perimeter. Another part of your mission is to check the houses on both sides. One of you will remain under cover outside while the other knocks on the door. Find out if someone is home and who they are. If no one answers, try the doors. If you can get in be careful not to get ambushed by some scared civilian or the enemy. Do a quick check of the house and see how much food is in the kitchen. Make a quick map, I'm sure you'll find pen and paper. You need to be back here before dark because we'll be moving at dusk. We need someplace safe to hole up for the night. Any questions? I know you're probably getting hungry, but we'll have hot food just before we leave here. I think we have about three hours before it gets dark enough for us to move safely. OK pair up and head out. Oh, and by the way, don't try any John Wayne shit, stealth is our best defense until we locate where ever command set up headquarters. They looked at each other and headed out in opposite directions.

I heard a grunt, looking at the sergeant I saw him trying to get into a more comfortable position. He then said, "Well that was as good a mission briefing as I could have given, however I'd have given them a password to reenter our perimeter."

"All except you are from our company and everyone except the cook and clerk live in the barracks. I'm not going to give them a password and countersign until we move out at dusk. What's your best guess as to the location of the other trucks and soldiers?"

Scratching his jaw he stuttered, "My guess would be one on either side of us on this side of the road. They hit us in the curve. We really need to move to higher ground because if they blow Belton damn we could get washed away. I think we should head back to Ft. Hood. We're short on equipment and supplies." Just then we heard a single shot and then someone yelling.

I took off at a run around to the back of the house. I yelled, "Who fired that shot?" At the far corner I heard my company clerk yell "I did sarge."

Dropping beside her position I said "Why?"

"The five guys out there didn't stop when I told them to."

I then yelled, "OK, you guys, this is how its going to go down. I want you to stack your weapons where they can be seen. Get out your ID and lay on your back with arms and leg's spread. You are within the field of fire from more than one position so running isn't an option. After you comply, I'll sent someone to check you out. Any of you still armed or if you try anything, we will kill because we don't have anyplace to hold prisoners. Any questions? If not, one of you stack the weapons and then lay down. Then the rest of you move to a spot to the left of the bushes." I watched four of them move out into the open and lay down. I then said, "You are missing one of your group. Either he comes out now or you need to lie real still while we put a few bullets into his position." Then I yelled, "Don't target the ones laying on their backs, but anything around them is a free fire zone upon my command."

I'd no sooner gotten the words out of my mouth than we all heard, "Coming out, don't shoot!"

"Put your weapons on the pile and then your web gear. If any of your group is wearing web gear have them unhook it and roll off it. After you put their gear in the pile they can lay back on their backs, then you assume the position with your ID out. The soldier I'm sending out will be nervous. He'll approach you from the head, check your ID, then put his pistol under your chin and pat you down for any other weapons. When he clears you, he'll send you in one at a time for verification. We've already had one attack and casualties so a twitch from any of you will get a bullet. Am I clear?"

We all heard, yes sergeant.

I handed my revolver to the PFC in the other trench and said, "You understand."

He whispered back, "I can't go, I peed my pants."

"OK," I whispered, "I'll go out, but when I send them in I want you to have them sit separately with their hands on their heads. Keep your weapon on them and tell them no talking." To my clerk I whispered, "Move over there and cover them, until I get back they are to be considered unfriendly. OK. Then I stood up and ran to the closest of them. Putting my revolver to his head I said where's your ID. He tilted his head back and I pulled his military ID out of his mouth. It looked like him so I asked his date of birth, and it was the same as on the ID. Then I stated, "I'm going to move my revolver to under your chin so I can search you, so don't move." After patting him down I stepped back and told him to roll over so I could check his back. Then I said in a loud voice, "One prisoner coming in. I then told him, go in sit with your hands on your head where the PFC tells you. He's young and so scared he already pissed his pants so if you don't follow his instructions he'll probably just start shooting. I hope you understand and don't try anything." I then moved from one to the next until I got to the last. When I place my pistol to his head he whimpered. Checking his ID I saw the ID showed longer hair. Then I place my revolver under his chin and said, "I'm going to pat you down for weapons, so lay still." Starting at the left hand I checked the arm up and to the armpit. I felt extra clothing in the armpit, but not lumps. Same thing on the right arm. Then I started at the collar and when I got to the chest I realized I had a small busted woman under my hand. I whispered, "Do they know you're a woman?"

She whimpered back, "No."

"Lay still, sorry but I still have to check you for weapons, so I'll be quick." After I had her roll over I found a knife in her belt. "Tsk-tsk", I muttered, "by the rules I outlined before coming out here I should kill you, but I realize why you didn't expose it. On your feet, pick up all the web gear and when we get back on the other side of the perimeter take a seat and put your hands on your head. Also no talking." I picked up five M-16s and marched her back.

I had her move off from the others and asked her where she was from. After stating that she was from Ft. Hood I asked her how she got here. She said, our truck was shot up and then crashed into a swimming pool. I also asked her if she knew the four guys and she said no. I took her back and then motioned one of the guys over. I asked him the same questions and his only different answer was that he knew three of the guys but the shrimp was shoved on the truck just as they were leaving. I got the same answer from the guy that tried to hide from us. Then I took him back over and said to them all, "You story seems to check out, however, until our NCOIC clears you none of you will be given back your weapons. Get out your IDs. You," pointing at the shrimp, "collect their ID's and follow me." I picked up their M-16s and started back around toward the BBQ enclosure.

After the sergeant checked the ID's and said they look valid he asked if I'd checked any of their dog tags. When I answered no the shrimp pulled hers off over her head and handed them to me. After handing them to him he pointed out a couple of things that I should check on them including the side they were imprinted from. He then handed me his and I check mine, hers, and his. They all matched. "This PFC will take up a position by the truck while I bring the rest around one at a time, or should I just check their dog tags and it they match give them their weapons back."

He said, "Use your best judgment and what's so special about him." pointing at the shrimp.

I said, "The shrimp is a woman, I think we can trust her, and that ain't my balls talking. Everyone knows my company clerk is a woman, but we'll just nickname her as the shrimp if she is OK with that. I think it'll be safer for her for now." Turning to her I stated, "The enemy we're dealing with will kill or rape you just for the hell of it because you're not part of their group. So if the time comes that we're attacked I expect you to be a soldier and shoot to kill the enemy. Am I understood?"

She simply answered, "Yes Sir."

I then walked back around and the first three I checked their dog tags were OK. When I turned to the last guy he said, "I lost my dog tags."

I shoved my revolver into his stomach and reached up and pulled the silver chain around his neck up and looked at the piece of jewelry hanging on it. There was a wedding ring and a Star of David. Dropping them back into his fatigue shirt I commented, "As soon as we get back to post get your ass to personnel and get another set made. Also I'm going to check with my NCOIC about the unauthorized jewelry hanging around your neck. Now you four take this and that position. No one enters our perimeter without authorization. Have them stack their weapons and lay down on their backs while someone comes to get me. Any questions? Oh by the way I've got two scouts out, so someone from the next position up can verify who they are. We're all from one company." Then I told my to guards to follow me.

The scout returned reporting one truck found in a swimming pool along with a bunch of bodies. There were dead bodies in all the houses they checked.

About 6 PM the cook asked for two soldiers to help. They came out with a big pot of soup and a basket full of cups, bowls, and sandwiches. I walked the perimeter while they fed the troops. At each position I told them to come to the BBQ grill location as soon as the sun hit the trees to the west.

My other scouts returned from the east and reported that all they'd found were murdered civilians. However they did bring in all the can goods they found in some civilian backpacks. The Sergeant gave them a password and reply and told them to use the same stealth that they'd used earlier to reenter all the houses to the west and gather dark colored blankets and any canned food they could quickly gather. Then he told them that there was a gas station about 2 miles back up the road. We'd rendezvous with them a hundred feet behind the station. Then he warned them not to approach the gas station because it could be a rally point for the enemy, especially if they were using vehicles.

After everyone reported in I divided them into two groups. "OK now we are moving out to the west. I want two columns. Second man in the column keep you eye on the lead man in the other column. Quietly inform the lead man in your column it they get more than ten yards off. Lead man, you are the point man so if you spot anyone ahead of you crouch and hold up your arm to signal those behind to stop. Everyone else keep an eye on the point man and the outside of our column. Cook, you and your assistant bring the cooking gear you need and you'll be at the rear between the columns. Shrimp, you and the company clerk will travel with us between the columns and act as runners if we need to pass any messages. The Sarge and I will rove up and down between the columns. Now, if we suspect a trap or anything unusual the Sarge or I will give a whippoorwill whistle. If you hear that drop and assume a perimeter facing out. Stealth is our best defense because we're probably outnumbered. Now quickly check your and your buddy's gear to make sure you don't have anything that will rattle or shine. We move out in 2 minutes.

We passed through three backyards before hitting the woods. An hour later we were at gas station. Out scouts joined us there. We went on up and behind the next gas station and over the hill. Coming down the hill almost at the bottom he had the lead turn right. He sent shrimp back to bring the last two men up from the rear of each column. He instructed them to position themselves on the other side of the road so they could see down the road. They were to give a woof whistle if they saw any vehicles coming. The other two he instructed to cross the road and check around the storage unit area and the other building and then signal from the road edge if everything was clear. He gave them 15 minutes to scout the areas and report.

They gave us the all clear and we hurried everyone across and behind the storage unit area. As soon as the guys from the top of the hill arrived he explained that we needed to move about a mile off the road toward the lake before setting up camp for the night. After a ten minute rest we moved out again. Not a half hour later a dog started barking off to our left. Everyone froze except the sarge. He pulled his notebook out and tore a strip of paper from one page. He stretched it tight and started blowing on it. For a second I heard a high pitch whistle and then it got higher and I couldn't hear it. Dogs started barking all over the place and I could hear dogs barking so far away that I could barely hear them. Looking at the sarge I commented, "Neat trick, you got to teach me that one."

All he did was head for the head of the column and we started moving again. Shortly we stopped again and he quietly announced, "Rest in place, pass the word. We spend the night here. No fires, no smoking, no noise. Pair up, one man sleeps while the other guards, 2 hour shifts." After a few minutes I could hear the crickets and other nightlife start making their noises. A few minutes later I felt a tug on my web gear. It was the shrimp and she whispered to me that she needed to go to the bathroom. I led her over to a couple of bushes and pulled out my entrenching too and dug a shallow hole. I whispered in her ear grunt like you having to shit. Wipe from the rear and dump the paper in the hole and then cover it up and tamp it down. I could see reflections from several locations on the perimeter. I stood up and put my entrenching tool back in its web carrier and turned and quietly went back to my position. Listening I could hear some faint grunts and then the shrimp came back to my position and whispered loudly, "I'll stand guard, so you can get some sleep."

When she woke me up I went over to pee at the same bushes and when I got back she was curled up using my web gear as a pillow. The only talking I heard for quite awhile was someone asking what time it was. I was getting drowsy so I went over the perimeter and started checking each pair of guys. The third pair of soldiers I checked started making comments about the shrimp. I replied, "He's still got mama's milk behind his ears. By time this is over he'll know how to shit in the woods and walk like a soldier. Who's supposed to be asleep? Get to it." Then I worked my way around and met the sarge on the other side half way up.

"Any problems?" he asked. "All clear up front, we'll move out at dawn, in about two hours. Get some rest." We walked back over to where the shrimp was sleeping and he told the clerk to wake us as soon as it started getting light. I told her that if I started snoring to just give me a slight shake on the shoulder. I gently lifted the shrimps head and pulled out my poncho and lowered her head back on the pack. My poncho wasn't the most comfortable pillow, but it worked. I was just getting real drowsy when I felt someone throw their arm across me and scoot right up to my back. Opening my eyes I was looking right into the company clerks face. She whispered, "Is he queer?"

I whispered back, "No, he is a young woman and feels safer if no one knows. I discovered the fact when I searched her before allowing her and the guys into the perimeter. They didn't know, and she prefers that we keep her secret. I guess she thinks I'm a big teddy bear, so wake her if anyone appears to be approaching."

Then we heard the shrimp mumble, "He already taught me how to shit like a bear."

I heard the clerk chuckle as she stood up. Then I was out.

I felt someone shaking my shoulder. As I opened my eyes the shrimp said, "Kathy went to pee and she's been gone a long time."

"Which direction? Wake the sarge." Grabbing my pistol belt and M16 I headed off in that direction. Two of the new guys had her stretched out on the ground and one of then was humping her. I just butt stroke him with the butt of my M16 behind the ear and swung it back hitting his partner in the neck. He fell back and grabbed his neck. If he hadn't jerked his head up it probably would have cracked his skull instead of ripping his throat open. A couple of guys came rushing up from opposite directions with their weapons at the ready. The sarge arrived a moment later. I simply stated, "Rape is a capitol crime in some cultures. What do you want done with this scum."

He looked at the three soldiers and said, "I need three volunteers to bury this scum deep." By then Kathy, my company clerk was crying. That drew a larger crowd. He repeated, "Rape is a capitol offense, I need some volunteers to bury this scum deep and remove all identification from them before you bury them." Several guys each grabbed the rapist and started dragging them off and telling others to get their entrenching tools.

I stood up and said, "Situation is handled, reform the perimeter facing out. Shrimp get my poncho." Then I squatted by Kathy's head and called her name. The third time she answered so I said, "Give me your hand and let me help you up. We need to move you over by the bushes so you can clean yourself." Shrimp arrived with my poncho and I put it over Kathy's head and led her over by the bushes. The I told the shrimp to run over to the cook and get some water and a towel. Also grab a couple of field dressings off our gear. She was back in no time at all.

I then asked Kathy, do you want any help, I can leave the shrimp here for awhile. She replied, "No you help."

"Shrimp, grab a weapon and guard the other side of these bushes."

The sarge walked back and handed me their ID's and dog tags. "Handle this while I get the cook to make something for breakfast."

Looking at my company clerk, I told her I'd be back in a few minutes. When she asked why, I simply stated I needed to dig a latrine to make several deposits in. Then we heard off to the side, never mind sarge we'll have a nice hole dug in a minute. Several of us will use the facilities after Kathy. Kathy just said thanks guys and grabbed my hand and squeezed.

When the guys announced the hole was ready Kathy walked over to it. I handed her the ID's and dog tags. She dropped them in the hole and then squatted and peed on them. After she got up several of the guys shit on them and others just peed in the hole. Then they covered the hole and tamped the sod back in place. She started crying again as she thanked the guys. The shrimp took her by the arm and led her back toward our position.

The sarge came up with the cook and said, "You know its dangerous to bunch up in combat zone. Spread out so the cook can give you a light breakfast. We move out in half an hour." Looking around he again open his mouth and stated, "I was going to take a shit in this hole, but I see it's full. I guess I'll have to wait. Hopefully we won't need to dig another shit hole like this one."

After what the cook called breakfast we moved out and got the lake recreation area about noon. The sarge took 10 guys and headed down to the swimming area. After circling the building they broke in. A few minutes later he sent guys into the latrine areas and they reappeared with several rolls of toilet paper. We then moved to the far west end and set up a perimeter. The cook used one of the grills and made a pot of what he called stew. After seeing beans, corn, what looked like spinach, and a few other unidentifiable cans dumped into the pot I turned away and went to check the perimeter. As I crossed near the barbed wire fence I spotted the shrimp point at me. Suddenly Kathy jumped up and ran over and hugged me and thanked me again. Then she ran back and dropped into her position. I said, "You OK shrimp? The cook thinks he'll have what he calls food ready in about half an hour. Pass the word we'll bring it around and then move out. Also all the canteens need to be topped off. Pass the word that one man at a time cane come back to fill his and his partners."

After eating and packing everything up the sarge called everyone in. "OK we'll move out in the line formation we've been using. When we reach open area we'll split in half. One group will cross while the other covers them. After the first group has secured the forward area they'll signal and the rest of us will follow. If we come under fire only half will return fire while everyone else maneuvers to flank then, and then open up with everything they got. Just hope it isn't our soldiers. I'll try to make contact with the opposing force and verify who they are before we open fire on them. Lets move out."

Two days later we arrived at the airfield perimeter fence. We could see two choppers, one looked like it crashed and the other looked like it burned on the ground. After a quick conference the sarge ordered us back. After crossing the road again we turned north over the ridge line and then west again across east range road. Approaching one of the small arms ranges we could see motor pool road and a line of burned motor pools. We retreated back over the ridge and kept moving west. Our scouts kept an eye on the motor pools. Down near the west end we heard a firefight. Cautiously we spread out on the ridge line. A motor pool was under attack from our side. We sent in two scouts to see if they could tell who was who. They returned with an unconscious man. When he opened his eyes we could see the fear on his face. He started pleading for mercy in broken English. The sarge just kept asking him who was inside the building until the prisoner said Yankee solders. Then he tried and managed to break free. He made it less than 10 feet before one of the guys dropped him and then said, "Well sarge, what direction are we going in from."

With a smile the sarge knelt and drew a rough map of the area. It showed us attacking at a 45 degree angle against both ends of the enemy line about a quarter of the way in from both. Then he said, "We will move into position and each of you will take a single target from the ends toward the center. When everyone is in position we'll all fire at the same time. After that first volley pick your targets until none of them are left. Then I'll make contact with the soldiers inside the motor pool. Move out." It took us almost an hour to get into position.

We were stretched out and sighted in when the sarge fired from the far right end of our line. Almost instantly everyone else fired. Half the enemy line was down before they realized we were behind them. Then they broke and ran, although that didn't help them. We didn't find any live ones as we advanced to take up their position. Then the sarge yelled across the road, "We're US Army, send out someone to verify us so we can come in."

A couple of dozen soldiers stood up behind vehicles and started cheering. One yelled, come on in, the gate is just pushed shut.

Looking at me the sarge said, "Take five guys and verify they're our guys and then find out what happened."

I pointed at 5 guys and started forward. Suddenly two of the guys stopped and the shrimp and my company clerk Kathy took their places. We approached the gate and two guys jumped up and dragged it open. As soon as we were through they pushed it closed. One of them said the sarge is in the conex, but he's shot up. I looked at the corporal and said, "Lets see some ID and then lead the way."

He pulled out his dog tags and showed them to me. When I said, military ID card he turned and called one of the other soldiers over. Show them your military ID he ordered. The specialist pulled out his ID and showed it to me and I showed mine to them. Then I said, "Can't be to careful, they've already tried to infiltrate us once. Can you vouch for everyone here."

I could see the realization hit him. He turned and said, "Take six guys and disarm the two newbies at the front gate and march them back here. Anyone not from the company disarm and bring back to the conex. Tell Jones to take a few guys and sweep the motor pool and round up anyone not from our company. Now SP5, if you'll follow me I'll lead you to the sarge."

Over my shoulder I said, "One of you guys get back to the sarge and inform him of the situation here and prepare for a firefight to get out of here. Also scouts out a few hundred yards including the ridge."

As we entered the conex I heard, "Kenric what are you doing here. I saw you get in a truck for Belton." Turning I saw my First Sergeant. He was covered with blood from the waist down.

I replied, "We were ambushed this side and had to return. 32 survivors out of the four trucks. We now number 30.

After spitting blood on the floor he said, "Corporal, Kenric will be ranking man here shortly. Bust open the deployment conex and load as many MRE and all the water those mules can carry. Don't forget a few cans of fuel. Take our guys out of here. Kenric, I suggest you head up east range road and pick the best range you find to defend. Get the corporal to get a few radios out of the deployment conex and then burn everything on the way out. Don't waste time or wait for me to die, I'm entrusting these soldier to your hands." Then he started coughing up more blood.

The medic looked at me and said, "Nothing more I can do for him. What do you want me to do."

"Grab all the medical supplies you can carry and load them on the mules. We leave in fifteen minutes. Inform the corporal send the supplies out as they are loaded."

Chapter 2 The motor pool

When I got back outside to the sarge he took one look at me and started laughing.

When I asked why, he replied, "I haven't seen a mule since a few years after Vietnam. The first one I saw was loaded with ammo at NTC. I was told those little four wheeled platforms were used at forward post to move supplies to heavy to carry. In case these guys don't know, they can ride using the controls on the front or dismount them and crawl alongside and use the mule and cargo for cover from small arms fire. After we get up the road, we'll find out if these guys know how to use them and teach everyone else. By the way, one of the guys from the motor pool mentioned that your First Sergeant gave you some instructions before he died."

"Yup, he said move up east range road and find a range that we could defend and stay at until everything shakes out. There were forty three soldiers to begin with in the motor pool. Five of those were infiltrators and dealt with by the corporal's men. We also now have three more women. Two were personnel clerks and the other was a nurse. I think it best to divide everyone into three platoons and move out within the hour."

The first night I put my original personnel out on perimeter to guard and had all the motor pool soldiers gather in. I put the corporal in charge of one platoon and my SP5 mechanic in charge of the third. The third platoon consisted of all the mechanic's and women. Then I informed them all of the disciplinary action that I'd had to enforce on our way back from Belton. I also added the warning that until we had a secure location and somewhere to secure prisoners we would be taking no prisoners.

The sarge then stood up and confirmed my statements and stated that he would pull the trigger on anyone that didn't obey. He also offered to let anyone that wanted to leave have a days rations and five magazines of ammo. They could leave in the morning and would not be allowed to return.

The next morning no one wanted to leave. It took us two days to reach the bridge. The stream was low so I had the corporal divide his platoon in half. I told him to take one have east and cross then come back to the ridge overlooking the road and set up a fighting position. He picked another corporal and I told him to take the rest of the platoon west and do the same. We'd wait until they were in position and then we'd cross the bridge with the supplies and rest of the personnel. If they found anyone out there, disarm them first and then verify that they were soldiers. Also keep them under guard until we can verify that they are soldiers and read them the rules. Also if they were fired upon they should try one time to make contact with the persons firing on them. If they aren't friendly, kill them and confiscate their weapons and ammo along with any ID's, maps, or other paperwork they have on them. Our radio operators back here will be one of the clerks. If you run into any problems you can't handle with your squad, call back and we'll send reinforcements. OK corporal's, if you ain't got any questions, brief your squads and move out after you've fed your men.

Six hours later we crossed the bridge divided up in groups of four. Most of the groups had a mule and they continued up the road until reaching the top of the ridge and moved off to the right side and set up a perimeter. That evening we made a cold camp. We had the high ground and good visibility. We also had four prisoners. Three were soldiers and one was a civilian.

She was the only one armed and it was a small pistol with only three rounds left. She claimed that she was going to meet her husband to go camping when attacked on the highway. After turning down a side road she ended up crashing her car into a fence. She claimed she grabbed the camping gear they'd packed and ran for five days. She was terrified because she'd seen several people dead and she thought there was someone following her until she ran into the soldiers.

The three soldiers stated that they were on their way back to main post when they were ambushed. They crashed after being shot at, escaped, and ran. They claimed that no one followed them and last night they'd heard someone crying. They found her in a dry creek bed hung up in some brush unable to get free.

After asking her if they'd acted in any manner that was inappropriate she answered that they'd been polite except that they'd taken all the food she had left and eaten it.

I laughed and then informed all four of them the situation that we'd found in Belton, our trip back to Ft. Hood, and gave them the option of following our rules or taking off on their own.

They all said they wanted to stay. I put them under guard and told them I wanted their final decision in the morning.

In the morning I pointed out the directions they could go to get to main post, off post toward Temple, and finally north toward Gatesville. None wanted to leave so I told the corporal to get them gear and arm them. I took the civilian woman back to sarge's platoon. The SP5 mechanic in charge assigned her to one of the clerks and assigned her duties.

Two days later we found a range that we considered defensible with an intact tower off the road. We found three burned cars in the employee parking lot and when we found the bodies we buried them. I picked the mover bunker furthest from the road and had it set up as our headquarters. Our makeshift commo section managed to rewire some things so we had field phone contact between all the bunkers and the tower. Even with the backhoe we located it took over a week to set everything up to our satisfaction. We had the tower just inside our perimeter, and three trench systems with foxhole outpost.

Then we started sending out patrols to scrounge equipment and supplies from the ranges further north. We only found one more soldier and he was wounded. When the first patrol got to north FH they found plenty of bodies and one intact mess hall. They hot-wired two pickups and brought back all the rations they could carry.

The sarge wanted to organize an expedition to the north FH motor pool and attempt to get some fighting vehicles plus a few trucks.

My only objection was that we'd need to take most of our personnel just to do a proper job and have a group for security. I then asked him where we could get ammunition for the fighting vehicles. Also what would we do if we found a lot of dependents and civilians?

He commented if we had the vehicles, then we could make a raid on the ammunition dump on main post. Dependents and civilians we'd deal with if we find them alive.

Chapter 3 First Blood

Three days later we had our plan for raiding the North Fort Hood motor pools. That's when the commo section sent a runner to get me and the sergeant. The runner told us that they had contact with another unit over the radio, but told them they would not give any information until our NCOIC was present.

When we arrived I picked up the headset and told the operator on the other end to get me their NCOIC. Someone claiming to be a 2LT came on and demanded I identify myself. I told him that I was SP5 Kenric and I wanted to speak to his NCOIC or he could hang ten. After screaming over the radio he wanted me to authenticate Alpha Romeo. I then informed him that our radios were from a load-out conex and we didn't have any authentication books, so unless he wanted to put his NCOIC on he could get off our net. After another minute of yelling a calm voice came over the radio claiming to be Master Sergeant Wilcox.

I replied that I was SP5 Kenric and acting NCOIC of a mixed troop of soldiers retrieved from several locations. We were at present in a defensible location without external logistics or other support. We had two evacuation routes mapped and booby-trapped.

After a long pause he replied, your unit is in almost as good a position as we are. We have three tanks, and two deuces. Low on tank ammo, but good on small arms. Our next move is to gather more ammo and a fuel truck. Any ideas. By the way we are located in the impact zone on FH.

I told him to wait one. Turning to the commo man I told him to pull a PRC-77 with a foil antenna and tune it to our present frequency. I took it outside and set it on top of the bunker and called MSG Wilcox.

He came back with, "What the hell happened to your radio, you were 5 by 5.

I told him that I had a radio problem and would sent a couple of my scouts out to find him and his unit. After they verified that he and his unit were actually who they said they were, we'd resume contact. Then I told him my scout would be at his location within the week and he'd know how to authenticate us.

Turning to my sergeant I informed him that they were probably within 20 miles and we should continue with our plan on NFH, except we'd move all personnel except a detachment to maintain security here on this range. That evening we explained to all except the guards and then I designated a detachment to remain behind. The corporal, sergeant, and I chose a rendezvous range further up the road and he pulled his 15 men and explained what their new mission was. I then had the other corporal show them the escape route and how to arm the booby-traps.

Before dawn the next morning we moved out on the west side of the road. We all knew that it was a three day walk to NFH and then we had to infiltrate to the motor pools.

Several of the guys the first night were joking about the bitch squad when one of the women stuck the muzzle of her M-16 in his crotch and told him she could arrange for him to qualify for the bitch squad. That stopped all the lewd comments and jokes. The sarge came and told me and I replied that I knew all about it and then asked him how many shadows he had. Looking around he just said, "Hell, we might as well get a gallon of coffee, two cups won't do."

Five days later we had scouted and selected eight vehicles, plus two fuel trucks. One platoon had secured a dining facility, after eliminating the three guards quietly and replacing them with three of his troops. The early morning cooks were eliminated when they entered to fix breakfast for the terrorist. Two hours later eighteen terrorist entered and lined up for chow. One machine gun got them all.

The small arms basic load was secured in a warehouse only three hundred yards from the motor pool and it was ours as we moved into the motor pool at dawn. The guards were no problem and we had the trucks fueled and the fuel trucks topping off as the APC's we picked moved to the warehouse to load their ammo. I didn't want to waste the extra ammo by blowing it in place so I grabbed a 5 ton and drove over to the warehouse and told the crews to fill it to the top, then set the warehouse on fire. By then the first of the other trucks were at the dining facility and supply warehouse loading. Two trucks of ammo, three APC's, two fuel trucks and four trucks full of food hit the cattle guard to east range road two hours later. Our convoy rolled down toward the rendezvous range at thirty miles per hour.

I was getting load reports from each of the trucks and was surprised when one claimed to have liberated two cases of grenades and a pallet of claymores.

My scout had done their job to the T and we spotted two M-60s just short of the rendezvous range. They were dug in, one of each side of the road. As we pulled into the range parking lot a 2LT came running out and demanded the NCOIC report to him immediately. The sergeant stepped out of the truck he was riding on and saluted the lieutenant. Then he told the lieutenant to shut up and get under cover because when he returned the salute he identified himself as an officer and officers were the first target that any sniper would aim for. He followed as the lieutenant ran screaming back toward a tank.

I signaled for my commo guy to call our range and verify their status. He got an all clear and I then sent one fuel truck, two trucks of food, one truck of ammo, and two APC's on down the road to them.

The first thing I heard when I walked up to my sergeant was MSG Wilcox congratulating him on putting the fear of God in that butter bar asshole that got some of his men killed on more than one occasion.

When he heard my voice as I reported the trucks en-route to base he turned on me with a smile and informed me that my mother ran out from under the porch and bit officers.

It was hard not to smile as I told him that his mother needed rabies shots.

As he was telling us that his men would pull security he suddenly stopped and asked why he had two rifles pointed at him and why we were surrounded by half a squad of women.

I then told him what happened on our retreat from Belton and the field punishment I instigated.

He glanced back at the shrimp and said, I heartily agree with the punishment and that rule will be announced and enforced here by me and my NCOs. Lets go get some coffee. As he called in half of his NCOs to introduce them to us his lieutenant came out of his tank and started toward our tent.

I heard one of the women loudly announce officer in the area, rifle salute. Needless to say all we heard in the tent was someone scrambling to get out of the area. One of Wilcox's NCOs then said, "So that's how you control your officers in a combat zone."

I simply answered him by saying, "If I had an officer, he'd do the strategic planning and leave the day to day operations and planning to his NCOs like any good officer would. Officers tell their NCOs what they want done and then get the hell out of the way."

One young buck sergeant then commented, "Everyone knows that a sergeant outranks a SP5, however I think your experience outranks this sergeant. Right Top!"

Then MSG Wilcox told them that I had a mixed sex unit and they'd better pass the word quick that rape was a capitol punishment crime because we have no way to keep prisoners. Also my unit did not take prisoners.

One of his corporals then commented that he wished that the prisoner the LT insisted they take alive would escape. The only problem was that guy was so lazy they he wouldn't even roll over without an kick. I had my guard detail back off the other night and left him alone and untied for three hours and all he did was sit under a bush and whimper like a bitch.

I ducked my head as two of my escort walked in and asked who used the bitch word. When the corporal said I did they informed him that that was a word that he'd better inform his soldiers not to use. Then she explained that one of them would personally arrange for anyone that used that word to become qualified to join their squad. Then she pulled a knife and started stropping it on her boot. After testing the edge she announced that it was sharp and they left.

As the tent flap dropped I lifted my head and informed them that one of my female squad was a nurse and she'd make sure any castrations were done in a medically safe method. Now the female civilians I have have accepted military training, but prefer the Bobbet method.

Wilcox then turned and announced that years ago a woman was charged because she cut off her husbands junk and threw it out the car window as she drove away. "I think this meeting is over and you'd better brief all your solders before chow and relieve the sentries and have their NCOs report to me now."

Suddenly the tent flap was kicked back and the shrimp and my civilian drug in a sorry looking soldier that had no shirt on. Shrimp announced, "We found this trying to sneak up on the tent. Where shall we put this terrorist body?"

Wilcox then said, "LT, you are out of uniform in a combat zone. That means that you could be shot as a spy or terrorist. What do you want?"

The LT then said, "I'm the officer in charge of this unit. I insist that I must know what plans are being made. I'm in charge of this unit."

Then MSG Wilcox said, "Sit down over there and listen to the briefing that will start as soon as the rest of my NCOs get here."

His other NCOs entered and grabbed seats.

I noticed none of them took more than a glance at the LT.

MSG Wilcox started his briefing and informed them that my sergeant had a mixed sex unit. He plainly stated that rape was a capitol punishment crime and two soldiers had already been executed for a rape near Belton. They were to make sure that all of their soldiers were on their best behavior and also not to use derogatory words about the females in the other unit. They'd already been blooded in combat and chewed up the enemy.

One of the corporals commented they're only a bunch of rear echelon pussy's.

Then MSG Wilcox glared at him and stated, "Those supplies they brought in were secured by those pussy's and a bunch of terrorist at NFH died the hard way because those so called pussy's were there with weapons. Several of them prefer knives over M16's.

Shrimp then commented to her friend, "I never did get the idea of sticking a bayonet on the muzzle of an M-16. I like it better when I can just slice them up like a pig."

Genevieve then commented, "I just stick the knife between their ribs and then castrate them like they did my husband. After all they can't play with their 72 virgins without their joy stick or balls. Master Sergeant Wilcox, permission to go play with your prisoner."

I quickly stepped in and said, "Ladies, you have enough blood on your hands for today. We need to let MSG Wilcox's unit have some. Go take a break and locate the chow. All the exercise this morning has given me an appetite. Don't kill the cooks no matter what they say today, they don't know about my lady squad. Move out!"

Shrimp pointed over her shoulder with her bayonet and asked, "What about it."

Wilcox jumped in and said, "He's mine and he'll stay in uniform from now on.

Chapter 4 Punishment

"Corporal, escort the lady's to the mess tent and brief the mess sergeant before they go in. Make sure they get VIP treatment, after all it isn't every day we get new combat veterans visiting."

Not five minutes later the corporal rushed in and yelled, "There is a riot in the mess tent. One of the KPs reached over the line and grabbed the little one by the tit and she stuck a fork in him and then butt stroked him with her rifle. Two of the other ones grabbed her and took her knife away before she cut him. Right now the mess sergeant is telling all our men to get out of the mess hall because these are amazon warriors. Somebody is going to get killed as soon as they get their rifles."

As I stood up Wilcox told the LT, "Now is the time you should act like an officer. You got two minutes to get your uniform straight and get to the mess tent. Otherwise you are going to cause the death of more good soldiers."

As Wilcox entered the mess tent he roared, "At Ease!"

Pointing at my lady squad he roared, "Please stand over by your sergeant at that table."

Then looking at the mess sergeant he bellowed, "What kind of undisciplined chow line are you running when a KP is allowed to molest a soldier? Drag that individual over to my table as soon as someone gets us three cups of coffee."

Looking at my lady squad, I said, "Lt. Andrews, if he is in any danger of bleeding out render medical aid, after all you are and officer and a nurse."

I heard several gasp as she handed her M-16 to one of the girls and pulled her pack off. She pulled a camouflage aid bag out and walked across to the mess line where the KP was laid out being looked over by a couple of young soldiers. After examining him and putting a dressing over the holes caused by the fork, she told them to get her a bucket of cold water. She then instructed the two young soldiers to secure him as she poured the water over his head. After a few splutters he sat up and made a grab at the M-16 laying on the floor. She stepped on his hand and slowly flashed her bayonet in front of his face saying, "Soldier, you are in enough trouble already. As an officer in the US Army, I am advising you stop resisting and start thinking about a defense for your assault on a female soldier. When I remove my foot, if you move that weapon on the floor, my only conclusion is that you are attempting to kill me. In that case I will be completely within my rights of self defense to use this bayonet to prevent bodily harm from your actions. I am a nurse and know all the body parts that a scalpel will immediately remove. Your choice."

He looked up at her and his mouth dropped open. "I'm sorry." he said and dropped back down.

MSG Kendrick ordered one side of the mess tent raised and tied up. After that was completed he then had some tables moved so two were together and two separate in front of them. The KP had his arms tied behind him and was seated at one table and the Shrimp at the other. He asked LT Andrews to put her rank insignia on and sit in the middle chair at the long table, his LT to sit beside her. Then he sent one of his solders to gather an audience and have them stand just outside the open tent flap.

A few dozen soldiers from his unit and almost a dozen from my unit bunched up in two separate groups eyeing each other. With his coffee mug he rapped on the table and announced that a 1GT court was now in order.

Addressing the KP he loudly announced that he was charged with improper conduct for a soldier by physically assaulting a female solder. He asked what he would plea, guilty or not-guilty.

Hanging his head the KP plead guilty.

He then turned to the Shrimp and said, "PFC Wallace, you are charged with assault with a deadly weapon in self defense using a fork, assault with a deadly weapon in self defense using rifle butt, and almost assault with a deadly weapon in self defense with bayonet instigated by the actions of the KP. What is your plea, guilty or not-guilty."

She stood up and stated, "I was reacting to his grabbing me, and I'd do it again!"

He then turned to the two Lieutenants and quietly stated, "We have a situation here that has to be resolved quickly. Will both of you support what I have in mind."

When they both agreed he turned and loudly announced. "KP, you are guilty of assault, ten days bread and water under guard on details I will assign. Pfc Wallace, your reaction to the assault with the fork and rifle butt was pure self defense. However pulling your bayonet was over the top and if you hadn't been restrained you would be up on charges for murder. Your punishment is five days bread and water under guard on details that I will give to your NCOIC. If either of you object to the punishment I've given you may appeal to your unit commander and then we'll hold a field courts martial. Then you will face more serious punishments."

Shrimp looked a me and started to open her mouth and I shook my head from side to side. Then she said, "Sergeant, I'll accept my punishment."

The KP stood there and said, "This ain't fair, but I'll accept my punishment this time."

With his hand on his chin, MSG Warren, loudly said, "SP4 Hernandez front and center. You were assaulted by two soldiers earlier this month. State all the details from the beginning."

She moved up between the tables and said, "Specialist Kenric, must I?"

Thinking quickly I stated, "Yes you must to clear the air and settle any future charges."

With tears in her eyes she started, "I was grabbed by two of the soldiers we rescued near Belton. They were raping me when they were caught. Several soldiers from the unit executed them and buried their bodies."

Then Wilcox asked, "Why didn't the chain of command charge, try and sentence those soldiers?"

She answered, "It was so fast, I don't know. Maybe my sergeant can answer better." looking at me.

I stood up and then said, "The two individuals caught in the act of raping her while we were retreating from and enemy of unknown strength in hostile territory were tried, sentenced, and executed under my order. The integrity of the unit and moral demanded extreme measures to prevent chaos."

With a slight smile Wilcox turned to the lieutenants and whispered something. They both nodded yes. Turning back facing me he announced, "Specialist Kenric, your punishment for taking command in a situation without proper authority is one day of bread and water. Then you will assume the field position of first sergeant of your unit. Do you wish to appeal your punishment."

I could hear some murmurings from the soldiers outside the tent and thought what the hell is going on. Then pulling myself to the position of attention I announced, "My punishment is unjust, but I will accept the field punishment assigned by this legal authority." Un-slinging my rifle I held it at arms length and said, "Specialist Hernandez, secure my weapon until I've completed the first part of my punishment."

With a puzzled look on her face she grabbed my rifle and said, "What?"

Looking at my lady squad I simply stated, "My punishment is in two parts, first as a prisoner or bread and water for one day, second I must act as first sergeant of my unit until our military problem is resolved. I would suggest that the Shrimp's weapon be secured and she be marched over to our vehicles to start her punishment."

As she was escorted out of the tent I heard, "Corporal Jones, secure the other prisoner by the LT's track. Mess sergeant, get your area cleaned up and start feeding these soldiers, also I need bread and water delivered to all three soldiers under punishment. Make them end pieces, hopefully stale. Lieutenants, SSG Henderson, if you will follow me to my tent we need to discuss our situation." Then he pointed at two soldiers and ordered, "Escort the prisoner, SP5 Kenric, to my tent."

Upon arrival at his tent he loudly stated, "Sit over there prisoner." The he and the lieutenants started discussing integrating our units and where we should locate our main camp. LT Andrews looked at SSG Henderson and stated, "I'm a nurse, not a combat soldier."

He simply stated, "You are the ranking officer in our two units, so you have to assume command, My LT will have to be your XO. Kenric and I will handle the soldiers and day to day details. However both of you must support our decisions or the units will turn into a mob and then heaven help us. Fear of what has happened and discipline is the only reason we are still functioning as a military units and not mobs. First we need a secure base to operate from. Then we need to scout both NFH and main post. We also need secure food, ammunition, and fuel sources.

SSG Henderson, you will be our personnel sergeant and we need a system set up to identify all of our present soldiers and a way to identify anyone we either rescue or capture. Kenric's method was hard and raw, but it worked then. We need something slightly more civilized now.

"Kenric, get someone to sew you some first sergeant chevrons to put on your uniforms.

"LT Andrews, you need to think about a headquarters. Might I suggest you appoint me your 1SG. That way with two 1SG you can split the units for different operations. Also you might think about keeping your lady squad as headquarters security." Raising his hands to stop her retort he said, "I know they are perfectly capable of combat operations, but the men might try to be protective and get in situations that could endanger the unit. Think about it."

LT Warren started to complain, but was quickly shut up when Wilcox stated, "Suck it up LT, your actions in the last month have pissed of half the unit. If discipline fails somebody will probably frag you."

Kenric, do you have any clerks in your unit, I have one in mine. They need to report to the LT's asap. For now we'll use my tent as an orderly room. The first punishment detail I can think of is setting up a nice rock bordered path to the front flap. Moving and painting rocks has been a punishment for longer than I've been in the army. I'll get a sergeant to supervise starting in the morning.

"Kenric, instruct PFC Wallace that her conduct while on punishment detail will set an example. Every male soldier in both units will be watching. If she shirks any of the work she'll put all the women at risk."

Just then the mess sergeant entered the tent with a loaf of bread and three canteens.

Wilcox told him to deliver the bread and water to the prisoners with a visible show of contempt and if either of them say anything tell them to suck it up and act like the soldiers they are. Then leave Kenric over where Wallace is. I hate to have to do it but you will have to deliver the bread and water for as long as they are on punishment detail.

He stopped to feed the KP first and then escorted me to my vehicle. As soon a we approached the Shrimp got to her feet and started toward me. "Sit down shrimp, we'll talk in a minute."

The mess sergeant split the remaining bread and handed half to me and the rest to shrimp. Then tossed both canteens on the ground and stated, "Guards, he's yours for now."

I picked up both canteens and walked over to the truck and sat leaning back against one of the rear tires. Shrimp came over and sat beside the other. Hernandez came over and kicked a little dirt up and quietly said, "What do you want us to do sarge."

"Pull guard duty as you were directed and have someone sew some 1SG chevrons for me to wear day after tomorrow. Have someone get some blankets for us tonight. Also find out where the field latrine is set up, we'll need to be escorted when we go. You realize we're being observed by soldiers from the other unit so be professional. Now I'm starving so we'll eat as soon as you back off."

We devoured our bread and then Shrimp looked at me. "I'm still hungry."

"I'm still hungry too. We'll have to wait for breakfast. Now the punishment detail we'll be on starting tomorrow will be making an entrance path to the orderly room tent, in other words moving rocks and making a clear path. You are going to have to be tough. The example you set will reflect on all the women in our unit and any women we rescue in the future. By the way, if you hadn't pulled your bayonet you'd gotten off with just a reprimand. But you set the example, and I think all the male soldiers will think twice before grabbing any of you women again, especially after Juanita told her story and the punishment I metered out. Wilcox is cagey like a fox, he set me up as field first for our unit and put the lieutenants in a box where they will have to support us."

Then I heard a cough from under the truck. "I got some real food for you. Anything else you need?"

Quickly I commented, "We can't accept the food. We're being watched. However, you can pass the word that we will be setting the example for our unit. Combat troops come with an attitude, and we've got to show them even the women are as tough as they are."

The next morning a sergeant walked up and announced that he was in charge of the punishment detail. We got up and followed him. One of our guards followed us and the other picked up our blankets and threw them in the truck.

When we arrived at the tent the KP was sitting on the ground. MSG Wilcox came out of the tent and told the sergeant that the punishment detail would clear a four foot wide path from the entrance of the tent out twenty feet. Each side of the path was to be neatly lined with rocks. All rocks will be removed from the path and it will be raked smooth. He was to escort us to the mess tent for bread and water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Latrine breaks would be supervised. Work breaks would be ten minutes every hour. At the end of the day we would be marched back to our respective detainment locations and turned back over to the posted guards.

My hands were blistered even through the gloves that we were furnished, but we got the path finished that first day.

Chapter 5 Interrupted Plan

That night it turned chilly. I asked for extra blankets. Shrimp and I both shivered. We were under the truck between the tires to keep out of the wind. When she complained that her hands were freezing I told her to tuck them in her arm pits or in her pants to warm them up. She did.

A little while later she asked me if my hands were cold. When I answered yes she told me that I could tuck my hands in her pants to warm them. I answered, "If I put my hands in your pants to warm then I don't think I could stop with just warming my hands. I'd probably want to warm something else too."

She answered me by saying, "I'd rather share body warmth with you than anyone else around here. Several of the girls would. Juanita has told me that she gets hot every time you are near. You have your choice of almost any of us." With that she rolled over and gave me a long kiss on the lips. One hand was around my neck and her other hand darted down toward my crotch.

I was getting an erection when I realized her pants were undone. One hand was stroking between her legs and the other inside her T-shirt. Her skin was hot and she wasn't wearing a bra.

My left arm was pinned between us as she pulled her knees up and continued kissing me. She was fumbling with my belt and zipper when LT Andrews crawled under the truck and slapped her on the butt.

"Cool it, your making noise. Wait until we get back to the bunker day after tomorrow. I need Kenric back at the orderly room, Wilcox needs to see him."

"Dam it June, I'm first."

"I know the order Alice, you will be. Right now our survival has to come before our pleasure. Pull your pants up and get some sleep. He won't be back tonight."

I gave the Shrimp a quick kiss and whispered, "I'll hold you first." Then I rolled over and fastened my pants and crawled out from under the truck. Both of the guards giggled and one pointed out the fact that my erection was showing. She then pulled off her field jacket and handed it to me saying, "Wear this until it is my turn. I'll find you one your size."

June then informed me that the Wilcox's scouts had come across several trails of small groups of unknown personnel.

Back at his tent we discussed sending out more scouts, also moving down to our secure area. I told him that it was set up the best we could to repel an attack, but there were to many holes in the perimeter to keep out infiltrators.

Wilcox then said, "I guess we'll have to move back into the impact zone. I think we can set up a couple of ambushes. The only problem is some of the terrain may be to rough for those tractor trailers you got at NFH.

~ ~ ~

Chapter 6 Brass picker

"Well, that can work to our favor. We'll send out scouts to find a trail for the vehicles. When we get to a area that's impassable we top off everything that can keep going, then camouflage the vehicles. You and I both know they'll find them."

After a moment I continued, "Hopefully you have some snipers with a good scopes. We'll also booby-trap some claymores on any approaches. If you have a squad for bait we can also leave them. However I only have one pallet of claymores and a case of grenades. Our retreat into the impact area will have to generate enough noise to attract them."

Wilcox replied, "That sounds like a plan for us here, but what about your CP south of here."

"I'll need to contact them and tell them about the threat. I think they will want to rendezvous with us in the impact zone. However, I hate to abandon that range."

His LT then piped up, "We can't split up the our unit, we barely have enough men as it is."

Wilcox then said, "The LT is almost right, but the infantry squad we rescued can be do our ambush and snipers. Hopefully you can furnish a few personnel also."

I replied, "Most of my soldiers will volunteer, even the women. I hope the women won't be a problem. Knowing them they may even volunteer to stay with the vehicles as bait, I pity any enemy that they catch."

LT Andrews then commented, "I think we should send out a patrol or two today and have them return at dusk. Then after eating we can sent everyone needed to scout the path into impact zone. I also think we should retake NFH, or at least get everything we need and destroy the rest."

A corporal entered the tent and announced, "One of our patrols caught a civilian family on the edge of the impact zone. He claims he lived in Gatesville. I think he's a brass picker. They are bringing them in."

Looking at the corporal I said, "Have them hold him just inside the perimeter, MSG Wilcox and I will come to where you have him."

Wilcox looked at me and said, "What the hell."

"Look, if he is a brass picker and escaped with his family from Gatesville he probably knows some safe routes through the impact zone. We may be able to use his knowledge to infiltrate NFH and move any vehicles we get. I'm not above using any asset we can find. We can use his family as leverage once we insure he's the real thing."

Bill Gail was his name. Wilcox and I grilled him for almost an hour and then started on his wife. His three girls were terrified. The oldest was only seventeen and the youngest thirteen. We separated them and we started on the daughters one at a time. They all had the same story, but not word for word.

When we finally moved back to Bill, Wilcox said, "We think you might be the real thing brass picker, but we're going to keep your wife and girls back with our rear guard. You however, will come with us."

Three of my lady squad walked up then and said, "Where are the women that were captured. We'll take charge of them."

I could see him deflate as he watched Brenda playing with her bayonet. Looking at him she raised her voice slightly and said, "Don't worry about them, my girls and I will keep them safe from these horny guys around here as long as you play it straight with my sergeant. However, screw with us and we'll do to them worse than we did with those guys we caught the last time we visited north Fort Hood. They went to meet their maker without any balls and a nice hole we made with our bayonets where they like to stick their peckers. Am I clear?"

With dread in his eyes he asked, "Sir, are you going to keep them safe."

With a laugh another of the girls stated, "We're women and nobody that has tried to rape us is still alive. Does that answer you question?"

With a groan Wilcox exclaimed, "One of the lady squad almost killed one of my soldiers the first day here because he reached out and grabbed her. If two of them hadn't stopped her, she'd have gutted him like a hog. Your wife and daughters will be safe as long as you are honest with us. We are going to raid NFH again and could use your knowledge of the impact zone.

"Girls go secure his women and bring them back over here."

"Yes Sergeant Wilcox."

"Mrs. Gail, our unit is going to raid north Fort Hood again and we need your husbands knowledge of the impact zone. The lady squad will be responsible for you and your daughters safety as long as your husband is honest and helps us. After this raid, if you want to go your separate way you will be given a few days rations and allowed to leave. If you want to stay, we'll make room for you."

The move into the impact zone was without problem. Bill knew the lay of the land and we even got the tractor trailer trucks in without to much problem.

Our ambush squad reported eight enemy ambushed and bought their weapons and ammo in. They also found a hand drawn map and notebook. The problem was we had no one that could read the squiggly script.

Chapter 7 The raid

We arrived just outside of NFH before dawn. After going to ground we sent three scouts forward to reconnoiter the area. The Indian had the annoying habit of sneaking up behind us and then asking us if we'd heard him approach. I jumped out of my skin more than once on the trip north because of that.

When they reported back we knew we had it to do. There were about 75 enemy and they were rotating guards on three shifts with roving patrols. They also found a barracks with several women being used.

The Indian suggested that we use claymores to eliminate most of the enemy in their barracks and set up claymores along the patrol routes. They would need three more stealthy guys to take out the guards at the motor pool and warehouses.

It took half the next night to get the claymores set up at the barracks. By then the booby-trapped claymores were set along the patrol routes. We determined that the best time to attack would be 0600 because we only had six night vision goggles.

The attack went off with only one hitch. One of the patrols was out of place because they'd decided to wander off and smoke their dope. We lost two men and three wounded because of those doped up assholes.

The guards at the woman's barracks managed to kill one of the women before they were taken out. The scout that took them out said he'd never seen women so vicious when they realized they were rescued. They went out of their way to mutilated every enemy body they passed as they were escorted back to our rally point.

We took every vehicle that would run from the motor pool and emptied the warehouses. We had to stash three loaded vehicles in the impact zone due to lack of drivers. On the way out we set fire to everything that would burn. The women rode in the back of an almost empty five ton truck.

At the end of the day we set up a temporary camp near a dry creek bed. From what the 5 ton driver told me the women were going acting weird because they just huddled together and shivered, besides their moaning and crying.

I grabbed a hummer driver, told him to drop his trailer and beat feet back to the main camp. He was to tell MSG Wilcox that I needed the Shrimp up here ASAP. I also reminded him what she'd done to the KP and warned him to keep his hands to himself. He wasn't happy when he left, but traveling light he thought he could make it back by noon the next day.

Then I sent the scouts around camp to find clothing and blankets for the women. When they returned I led them near to where the women were huddled. I took a blanket and set of fatigues that smelled like mothballs and sat down about ten feet from the women. Quietly I announced my position and name.

Several were looking at me.

Then I said, "I have some blankets and fatigues. If one of you will come over here I'll give you a set. My unit consist of US Army soldiers that escaped the first attacks. We've been in a running battles since. If you decide to trust us you can join us. If not we'll give you a weapon, ammunition, food, and water and let you leave." Then I sat there and watched them talk amongst themselves. Finally one got up and limped over, but kept just out of arms reach. I held out the blanket and fatigues at arms length. "Sorry they smell like moth balls, but at least they're clean."

She looked at me like I was nuts and gabbed the fatigues. After holding them up to her face and smelling them she launched herself at me and landed on top. I quickly realized that she was just holding me down, not trying for my knife or pistol. Two other women scrambled over and took the blanket and fatigues. One of them then said, "Do you have more?"

"If you will let me up I will get more, or I can call my scout over that has them."

The woman on top got off and squatted beside me and then picked up a rock.

I called over my shoulder, "One of you bring up the fatigues and blankets on my clear side and set them down. Then back off."

I then heard, "Sarge you got a pair. I almost pulled the trigger when she jumped you. If you'd fought she'd be dead."

"Then I'm glad I was relaxed. These women have had it rough. One of you guys find a couple of pots of water. I'm sure they would like to clean themselves before putting on clean clothes."

The woman with the rock dropped it, grabbed me and started sobbing. Her two companions started patting her on the back and I could see the tears in their eyes. I heard a quiet here as my scout set some blankets and fatigues down.

One of the women grabbed him and also started sobbing. I caught the flash of his knife as he put it back in its sheath. Then he just started patting her on the back. After a minute or two he used his free hand to pick up several blankets and said to her, "Lets take these blankets over to the other women."

She had the blankets from his hand in a flash and was running back to the main group. The third woman then asked, "You're Apache, aren't you."

He replied, "Only half."

She replied in a language I didn't know and he answered, I guess in the same language. She then turned to me and said in English, "White eyes, you have my spirit."

I was puzzled by the comment, but then thought of something I'd read. "I return to you your spirit, and offer you my knife to protect yourself and the other women."

I guess my reply was what she needed because as I handed her my knife she grabbed my hand and made a small cut on it and her hand and clasped them together. Her only word was something in Apache, then she got up and strutted back to the other women.

Looking at my scout I asked, "Was I just adopted?" He slapped me on the shoulder and grinned. Then he answered, "White eyes, you just got a wife if you accept her. When she gets done talking to the other women you may have a harem. Tread carefully if you don't want her. I'll tell you the custom later."

"Oh shit, I don't need another woman trying to get in my pants."

A look of astonishment crossed his face as he said, "The women with your unit. How many?"

Answering him, "I don't know, I just found out the other night. We were interrupted and another mentioned an order that they were to get me in. I think I'm screwed!"

With a laugh he commented, "I thought something more that sleeping was going on under that truck, but I didn't mention it to Wilcox."

The woman sobbing on my chest lifted her head and said, "You have other women here."

"No, they are south of here, but I've sent for one. They are all soldiers and hardheaded. You'll be safe and they can teach you if you want them to. Now take these blankets and fatigues back over to the rest of the women."

"No, you two bring them." she replied and got up.

Sgt Longbow got up and said, "Well you heard the boss sarge."

We gathered the fatigues and blankets and followed her back to the main group of women. She started calling them up one at a time and introducing them to us. My new name was White eyes and Longbow's was Sgt Elisha. That's when I figured out that she must be part Indian also when she started talking to the woman with my knife in that strange language. The other woman bent down, picked up a pebble, chanted over it and then handed it to me.

I looked at Longbow and he said, "You need to accept. This is an exchange of gifts. You still need to either accept or reject the proposal, but at least you now have some time to make a decision."

Just after noon the Shrimp and her driver arrived. The hummer was piled high with stuff that wasn't in it went south. I saw the Shrimp question one soldier. I could tell from his posture that she intimidated him as he pointed over where we were. She started my way and the hummer followed. As she approached she took one look at me and then walked down to the women. Whatever she barked at the women made them all stand up. As the group approached the hummer the driver shut it off and ran.

Sgt Longbow and I just stood there and laughed as they tore into the clothing and other stuff in the hummer. Then the Shrimp pointed at four soldiers and told them to grab the water cans and carry them down to the creek. They hesitated until she put her hand on her bayonet. The women scurried to the side as the guys grabbed the eight five gallon water cans. Then they grabbed the bundles of clothes and walked back to their area by the creek. After the Shrimp saw that they were going to start cleaning themselves she barked, "You guys better face away so these women can have some privacy." Then she marched over to me and turned me away. Longbow was laughing so hard he was crying.

After a few minutes he commented, "Good thing she wasn't here yesterday. I think someone would be walking in the Happy Hunting Grounds."

As she twisted toward him I said, "Don't say another word, I'll brief her."

Grabbing her arm I drug her over to a fallen tree and told her to sit. "After rescuing these women I got some blankets and fatigues and took them over near them and offered them if one of them would come and get them. One young woman was selected and came over. I offered her a blanket and set of fatigues at arms length. She jumped me and forced me to the ground. I realized she wasn't trying for my knife or rifle so I lay there while two others came over. After smelling the mothball smell of the clothing she started sobbing on me. Her older sister and the other woman took the clothing back to the other women and they changed."

Squinting she said, "And what else, don't lie to me."

"The older sister offered her spirit. I declined and offered her my knife so she could protect herself and the other women. She cut my hand and chanted something. Sgt Longbow told me that that was a proposal of marriage Apache style. This morning she gave me a round pebble and Longbow told me to accept it as an exchange of gifts. I've still got to figure out to decline her proposal and Longbow said he'd tell me how later. Satisfied?"

With a glare she jumped up and stomped over toward the women. Spotting a bayonet she zeroed in on the woman. After some words she pulled her bayonet. Feather Airwing picked up my bayonet off the blanket and handed it to Shrimp handle first. They exchanged bayonets and she stomped back to me. Handing me my bayonet she commented, "Stupid move white-man, you better get her straitened out fast or I'll scalp you." She then turned and sundered back.

I grabbed Sgt Longbow by the collar and said, "We will go get a cup of coffee and you'll tell me how to get out of this mess, or else." I damn near had to hold him up, he was laughing so hard, as we walked to the mess truck.

Chapter 8 Contact

By time spring came busting in we'd hit main post several times. We now had over a hundred female civilians and dependents. All had problems because they'd been used to satisfy the invading forces. It appeared that women from 16 to 25 were their favorites for sex slaves. Once we trained them, killing the enemy wasn't a problem for them.

For over two weeks we'd been using captured weapons and ammunition. We must have attracted lots of attention because the enemy units coming at us were larger and better led, but we knew the terrain and guerrilla warfare is a bitch.

They would set up a supply points and we'd raid them as we found them. Their patrols didn't survive contact. One thing that seemed to terrorize them were bare-chested woman screaming and running right at them with a large knives in their hands.

My Apache's taught many infiltration skills. I learned as well as I could. I still jumped out of my skin because now the women enjoyed sneaking up on the men and tapping us on the shoulder and asking if we'd heard them coming. They didn't tap the enemy on their shoulder, they just gutted them.

In October after destroying one of their ammunition dumps near I-35 we heard a plane flying low. Suddenly ten parachutes popped out the rear. My Amazons moved to intercept them. Three were gutted before I could stop them. They were Special Forces. Their NCOIC was still shaken when they dragged him to me.

I informed him that he and his men should consider themselves under our protection until we moved to a safe area, and then we'd see whether they stayed or got kicked out on their own. He agreed and told his surviving men. They grabbed their gear and asked for their weapons, but the women said no. I told him that this was a completely volunteer guerrilla unit and every one of the women had been abused by the enemy. The only men safe from them were the ones that trained them. On the way back we spotted a convoy, ambushed it, and took the remaining vehicles and used them to move to our temporary camp near Belton Lake.

What was left of our command structure was briefed. The military had held in northern Oklahoma and was now pushing south. They were sent to locate the problem the enemy seemed to be having in central Texas. My women started laughing and screaming. He and his men looked like they wanted to run and hide. I calmly said, "Death never had a prettier face than these women. You think this is bad, you should see the enemy when we attack. Those that don't die immediately die trying to run."

He replied, "Like I said, we're pushing south. We were sent to organize and train resistance fighters. We can supply leadership, communications, weapons, and ammunition."

The Shrimp slipped between us and placed her favorite hook blade knife against his chest and said, "We have our knives, bows, rifles, pistols, and explosives. Everyone of us uses what were most comfortable with. If we strung the balls we've cut off the enemy on a rope, it'd stretch from here to Austin. The one problem we have is that the buzzards follow us, because they know we leave them a free meal."

back to (ToC)

The Rock

"Is that idiot still in the waiting room?"

"Yes Sir," claimed Corporal Jones, "he's still there and still demanding to see the commander."

"The Colonel wants him got rid of, and if it weren't for the damn reporters outside I'd just throw him out the door. Send him in to see me. Oh and by the way Sergeant, bring me and only me a large coffee."

"Yes Sir."

A few minutes later a young man was ushered into Colonel Brown's office and told to sit in the wooden chair in front of the desk.

As Colonel Brown entered his office with his steaming cup of coffee he snapped, "What's your name and why are you here."

"Well Sir, I'm Jim Blanchard, and I'm sure I have a solution to the problem that our security forces have when dealing with those shit faced rioters!"

"Look punk, the best and the brightest, which you ain't one of have worked on that problem for years."

"Sir if you'll listen to me for a few minutes, I'll outline the problem and solution. If you can't do that then my next step is the press, and they know I'm here."

"SERGEANT, GET A CLERK AND GET IN HERE. Now you dog turd, you get to tell your theory and hypothesis, then I'm going to have the Sergeant escort you to the door. I'll send your shit theory up the chain of command to satisfy your over inflated ego, where they'll shit can it."

Jim sat straight in the uncomfortable wood chair and with a gleam in his eye said, "Fair enough."

The Sergeant entered with a female clerk. She grabbed the other chair and sat down pulling out her steno pad. "Sir, I'm prepared to record the proceedings now."

The Colonel replied, "This individual thinks he has a solution for handling the rioters. Record his comments and type them up. Send one copy to Colonel Briggs, one to me, send one to the JAG, and file one. OK Blanchard, state your name and other contact information and then start."

"Thank you Sir. The first time I remember the press making a big international incident out of a member of the border patrol using a firearm against a rock throwing individual, the kid was killed by a bullet and the press ignored the fact that a thrown rock can also kill.

"Terrorist use people throwing rocks to cause disruptions so their mobs can get good press when the police or military return fire with nonlethal weapons like gas or rubber bullets.

"It's about time that this bull shit gets turned around. I've developed a prototype rock launcher that can be easily carried and loaded quickly with any type rock from two inches in diameter to one the size of a paving stone. One man can operate it and launch rocks back against the rioters at a rate of one every four seconds. A pair of individuals working together can launch one rock a second. The launcher is so simple that anyone with half a brain can make something similar in a couple of hours.

"The great thing about it is the fact that you can aim it and hit a man size target at 20 meters. The press of course will claim you caused casualties. The sweet thing about the official reply is that you simply launched the rocks that were thrown at the police or soldiers were launched back at the rioters."

"Is that your great idea," said the Colonel.

"Now send that up the chain of command and lets see what they think about that. I'm sure the damn lawyers will have fun." And then with a sneer Blanchard stated, "After all you are simply returning the same rocks that were thrown at your personnel. If those same rocks kill a few of the rioters then the press can't gripe to loudly about your personnel shooting poor innocent protesters, can they? I'll wait 30 days and then be back. I don't want to be pestered by anyone until this is either approved or rejected. Oh, and by the way I'll start checking your window in about two weeks. If I see a silhouette target in your window I'll launch my reply from outside the base. The fence is only a hundred and sixteen feet to the east, so I'd move my desk out of the way. See you then." Getting up Jim said, "Sergeant would you please escort me out. And Colonel you'll be hearing about me. Next week I'll be in DC and I'll be breaking a few windows. After all the pentagon is a much bigger target, you may add that to the end of my report if you want to."

# # #

A week later Jim pulled over on the off ramp of the South Washington Blvd. Pulling out his jack and lug wrench he jacked up the left rear of the rental pickup. He removed the bald tire there and stuck the nail in and then rolled it to the rear of the truck. Dropping the tailgate he bounced the tire one last time with the nail on the bottom and hefted it into the bed. As he climbed in behind it he undid the valve stem so the air would leak out. Glancing around and then down at the range finders he made the final adjustments. The three bricks with Jim painted on them were ready and aimed at three top floor windows. Glancing around for a last time he tripped the releases and grabbed the good spare tire. Rolling it to the rear he kicked the pins from the support brackets collapsing them. When he got to the rear he grabbed the flat the laid it on top of the collapsed launcher. Jumping down he grabbed the spare and rolled it around and stuck it on the hub and had no sooner put the first lug nut on when a cop pulled up behind him and turned on his lights.

Walking up he said, "I ought to site you for not pulling off the pavement, but I know the jack would have just sunk in and then you would have then called for a tow truck and tied up more traffic."

"Thanks," Jim replied, "I'll be done in a few minutes." Lowering the jack he kicked the spare tire and turned to throw them in the bed. "Well, look at that bunch of soldiers running around their parking lot over there, wonder what they're doing?"

"Don't know," replied the cop, "but you better get moving."

Wiping his hand on his shirt, "Have a good day," Jim said as he turned and headed for the drivers door.

Watching his rear view mirror he watched the cop follow him down Southgate Road to N Pershing Drive where he turned right. After two more turns he was on I66 headed west. Climbing into the mountains 66 ended and I81 south took him out of Virginia into North Carolina. Parking the truck in a truck stop he carefully wiped down every surface inside the truck and then the door handles after removing the license plates. Picking up the jack, and lug wrench he transferred them with the launchers to his pickup and drove around front and parked. After a good dinner he headed south and then west.

A week later he pulled into the parking lot across the road from the base fence. With his binoculars he could see the silhouette target in the lower right hand corner of the Colonel's window. Unfortunately he could also see the back of the Colonel's head. _Dumb turd didn't move his desk_. After half an hour the Colonel got up and started across the room. I a flash Jim picked up the launcher, laid it across the top of the cab and pulled the trigger. The brick sailed over the fence and impacted dead center of the window. As Jim put the launcher under the canvas in the bed of the truck he could hear the Colonel yelling out his window for them to find the SOB that threw a brick through his window. As he turned right on Fort Street he could see the MPs searching the bushes inside the fence. Approaching the gate a couple of MP cars squealed around the corner and headed back toward where he'd just been. _Hope the Colonel cools off in the next two weeks_ , he thought as the light turned green and he turned right.

Two weeks later it was raining cats and dogs and the forecast was rain the rest of the week. Walking through the main door Jim thumped his umbrella on the floor leaving a nice puddle in front of the sign-in desk. He asked if the Colonel was in and if he had time to see him.

The specialist at the desk looked up and said, "Civilians aren't allowed in this building without an appointment. What's your name and I'll call up."

As Jim was saying his name the specialist reached under the edge of his desk. Jim straighten up and clasp his hands behind his back and waited. Then he said, "Security isn't as fast as it was in my day on active duty. How long a I going to have to wait for them?"

A voice behind him said, "I'm here, are you armed or just your irreverent self today? You pissed the Colonel off big time, and it took a talking to by the post commander to calm him down. You won't see him today, we're headed to Post HQ. Just between you and me, that bullet proof glass on the 7th floor stopped all but one of your bricks. It landed in a conference room and interrupted a few big wigs over from the Capitol. You really know how to get someone's attention."

A sedan picked us up out front and delivered us right to the front walk into Post Headquarters. Ten minutes I was sitting in front of the Post Commander answering questions. He then informed me that my next stop was Camp Lejeune and then the Washington area. His next comment surprised me, "A marine general wants to get his hands on you."

"Does Camp L have a wood shop?"

This brought a laugh from the General and he said, "Get him on a plane."

Landing in Wilmington we were picked up be a government sedan and headed north up the coast. An hour later we were still sitting in an office in a dingy wood building waiting for the general to arrive. When he did walk in he simply looked at me and said, "So you claim to be the one that can launch bricks three hundred yards and hit the top floor of the pentagon."

Crossing my legs I replied, "No, that takes a fixed launcher and lots of accuracy, I claim that a simple to build launcher I designed can return the rocks that a mob throws at anyone with lethal accuracy. By returning the same rocks thrown the liberal press can't accuse the defending forces of using military weapons on civilians."

"Well show me one!" the general snarled.

My escort suppressed a chuckle as I said, "Take me to a wood shop and I can build you one in about an hour and then we pick up some nylon rope and go to your rifle range for a demonstration.

At the range we watched a platoon finish up firing. I asked the general if he could get them to go downrange to the 25 and 50 meter targets and replace them with full silhouettes and then throw me some rocks of any size. After talking to the range OIC and NCOIC they called the platoon sergeant over and explained the task. He was still laughing as he led his platoon downrange. At the 50 meter line they put up ten silhouettes and then started chucking rocks at us. The general was grinning until one landed beside him and then we scrambled around behind the range shack. The range NCO commented one of them maggots got a good arm on him to throw a rock over 150 feet. A few minutes later some heavier rocks started bouncing off the range shack hard enough to make it shake. That's enough yelled the range NCO as he stomped around the end of the shack.

As I rounded the shack I picked up a few rocks of various sizes and walked up to the firing line. In my best voice I asked, "Range OIC, permission to engage the targets."

He looked at me an hollered, "The range is now hot, fire when ready."

I picked up my wood, assembled it, wound it up, picked up a rock slightly smaller than my fist and launched it at the 25 meter targets. It bounced short and still took a chunk out of the silhouette. By then I was rewinding my launcher and launched another and took the left side off another silhouette. Reaching back I grabbed a larger rock and it broke the middle support of another silhouette. While rewinding my launcher I yelled over my shoulder, "Platoon sergeant, send me over one of your marines, we'll see if he can hit the broad side of a barn." I lofted my aim and launched a rock at the 50 meter cluster of silhouettes. I hit one but it didn't fall.

I heard two voices say, "Prepared for instruction, Sir."

I commented while rewinding my launcher, "Stand to my left side and observe how I wind up the launcher and aim at a target. Then I'll let you try after another shot."

One target at the 50 meter line lost its head and the second broke on its right side. "Do you need further instruction or just hands on?

One said, "How do you aim it?

I shoved the launcher into his hands and asked, "You left or right handed?

"Left," he said.

"Good. Turn 45 degrees to your target, hold the frame with your left hand and wind with your right." Then I reached down and grabbed a rock and placed it on the launcher. "To aim you aim one silhouette height above the shoulders for every twenty meters as a general rule. Tuck the stock of the launcher under your armpit. Clamp down with your right arm and reach forward to the trigger. Elevate the launcher with your left hand making sure you're clear of the winding rope. Sight along the left side of the launcher and when you think you have the elevation correct pull the trigger. Did you see why you missed? Reload and fire again."

His third shot took a chunk out of a 25 meter silhouette. His forth was dead center on another.

I said, "Time to teach your partner. Give it up."

As his partner took the launcher I said, "Left or right handed." When he said right handed I commented, "Mirror image of your partners firing stance."

His second shot hit a silhouette.

After another hit, I said, "Now it's is time for rapid fire. One of you gather and load rocks, the other winds and fires. If you arm gets tired switch jobs. Since I know you don't have any questions I want the 25 meter targets all down and then the 50 meter targets. Go, Go, Go." Six more shots and the 25 meter targets all showed damage so I told them, "50 meter targets now."

His first shot was over and his second was short. The third bounced and hit a 50 meter silhouette. I said, "You've got the range, fire for effect."

As the last target was hit I could feel hot breath on my neck and heard, "Shit, that ain't possible. If I didn't see it with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it." Turning around I watched the general's lips move and heard, "I want a thousand of those things and a hundred of those brick launchers."

Smiling I said, "Get your marines to make them, but warn them that if they loose one, they'll be facing copies. You now have another weapon in your arsenal. Is it lunch time yet?"

The general growled, "Sergeant confiscate that weapon and get my hummer. We've got to get back to main post." Turning to me he said, "Young man, you aren't leaving my camp until I have working copies of everything including that brick launcher."

I replied, "Scaling is everything, the brick launcher is a specialized launcher for bricks only. I needed accuracy to get my point across and start the ball rolling. When they throw you the ammunition, your men can return it with lethal accuracy."

My escort said, "General, he's due at the Armory near DC in the morning. Also on the way up from Wilmington I received a text that they want to see him at The Shop."

They Came Out of the Sun

The sight picture was crap, just a gray blob floating above New York. She double checked the repelling line and her gear. All was prepared. After a deep breath and exhaling it halfway she caressed the trigger. A thin ruby beam shot forth from the barrel of her weapon. She dropped the weapon and felt the jerk as it reached the end of its sling as she leaned back and kicked off the side of the tower built on the ridge. Seeing the first paint splash on the rock she pulled the rope tight to slow her drop.

The knot at the end of her rope jerked her to a stop. As she swung around she grabbed the second rope and shoved it through her D-link and pulled it around behind her back. This rope at least went as far down as the cave. Kicking off she heard the air splitting and knew a thunder clap would follow.

Susan watched her sister drop and spin lifeless like a rag doll. She thanked God that the automatic brake stopped her fall. The scenario had proved accurate so far. It took the recovery team only twenty minutes to reel her sister down and lay her unconscious body on a stretcher. Blood was dripping from her ears, but she was still alive.

The Captains only comment was, "We'll need a taller tower next time, their shot took over 10 feet off the mountain top and started a forest fire."

Susan turned and yelled, "Don't you give a damn about the people under your command?"

His mild reply was, "Damn right I do! I can build towers all day long, but I know soldiers die in war. I wish it was otherwise." Turning he walked back down the tunnel as the medics rolled her sister to the infirmary.

That evening reports started coming in. There was now a crater in the middle of NYC. An estimated half million human casualties. The scientist at several locations reported that the original return beam was one meter in diameter, but due to atmospheric resistance and diffusion it was thirty one meters in diameter when it reached the tower. The bad part about the return shot was that its thermal effect left a straight line from the spacecraft to the cliff. They recommended immediate evacuation.

The good news was that they'd caught the main enemy hierarchy halfway between the ship and the UN building. They and their support teams and their escort soldiers were vaporized when the spacecraft brought up its protective force field. Estimated enemy losses were just under a thousand.

From the time of the first shot, the reaction of the force field, dropping the force field and the return shot was 13.5 seconds. That confirmed the fact that the spacecraft defense was completely automated by either a super computer or an AI. Five seconds was implementation of the force field and another estimated 4 seconds dropping it before returning fire.

The move to Hanover was stealthy. All the civilian vehicles gave them excellent camouflage.

The briefing was long. This time two shots would be made at the same time. One was from an automated laser in NYC and the second she would make from the new tower just outside town. The new laser setup was also described.

The next morning Susan climbed the tower and looked over the tripod aiming device. The emerald was being transported from Kentucky and would be installed in two days. Turning around she looked at the zip line from the corner of the tower to the treeline. Putting her gloves on she checked the cable fasteners and gave it a good jerk. She felt the tower sway slightly and turned back to check the sight picture on the laser mount. It was moving on and off the target. With one quick step off the platform she counted six seconds to the treeline where she hooked up to the second zip line while hanging from the first. Ten seconds later she slammed into the mattresses that were her dismount point. After regaining her breath she stormed toward the CP.

The Captain looked at her as she came through the door and said, "You don't have all your gear on for a proper test. Why?"

Flabbergasted she muttered, "It won't work, the sight picture changed as soon as I grabbed the escape line."

His reply floored her, "Ten seconds after you press the trigger the laser will fire. Four seconds later the mount drops through the bottom of the tower and hopefully the laser gem survives the drop on its own zip line. At eight second intervals after the first hit automated lasers start firing from six automated points within the city. The hope is that the automated defense system of the spacecraft will try evasive maneuvers and damage itself and hopefully kill a lot of the crew. If it rises a half mile and the observatory can lock on with their gas laser and also fire.

"You at least have a chance to survive. The teams in Buenos Aires and Sydney have various amounts of automation and are all ready to die. We all hope that at least one of the spacecraft will crash. We also hope that the aliens will withdraw, at least long enough for the science teams to explore their spacecraft so we can try to either start reverse engineering their stuff or try to figure out how to defeat their weapons. Be glad you're not in China or Russia. They plan on hitting their spacecraft with waves of thermonuclear weapons. Saturday at 1535 hours, the synchronized as attack time.

"And this is completely off the record, their second convoy of ships will be within reach of our nuclear arsenal at the same time. The astronomers calculate that they will start entering orbit at the same time. We got one shot. "

Saturday the weather was lousy. A hurricane off the Carolina coast had the winds blowing. The tower was swaying slightly as she stood behind the sights. The enemy spacecraft moved from one side to the other. Releasing the locks she put her hand on the elevation and horizontal wheels and started moving them to get the sway pattern. It wasn't to hard to keep the spacecraft centered. Her radio crackled with one word. FIRE. Pressing the button with her index finger she re-centered the spacecraft and got her pattern back. She could see the spacecraft perfectly centered as the laser fired.

When it quit she whirled, hooked up, and jumped off the tower. Reaching her D-link toward the second line she felt the thunderclap and passed out.

The Captains radio crackled and he heard, good shot secondaries under the force field. In the background he then heard, She's hung up half way down. Get a team up there.

Saturday night, Susan's sister wobbled in and sat at the Captains desk. "If she doesn't make it, I'll never pull the trigger again. You'll loose the two best snipers you ever had. One of the guys told me that she stayed on the tower until the laser fired."

"The doctors say she'll live, but her left eye will never be the same. Besides a detached retina, it's burned from the side radiation off the laser. I'm sorry, but she made the choice to stay up there." he said as he put his head down on his hands. "Here look at the preliminary report."

US and SA ships down. Science teams on site to examine. Russian and Chinese ships down but radioactive. They are sending teams in anyway. Australian ship down in the Pacific, non-exploitable at this time. African and European ships in orbit.

Eight of the twelve ships in the second convoy hit and venting atmosphere. Additional ICBM's being readied for launch.

"Well it's their move", said the Captain as he pulled the report back across the desk. "With their technology edge they can bombard us back to the stone age from orbit, or they can go looking for easier pickings. Even those wimpy politicians at the UN just couldn't sit still and stomach their initial demands."

Captain, we just got an additional report said the clerk as he dropped a paper on the desk.

Transmission from enemy spacecraft:

Your resistance to our occupation is unwarranted. Our demands were not that severe. Your military's managed to bring down 5 of our 7 planet side ships. You damaged our civilian population ships and killed almost half our population. We now can do one of two things. We can exterminate your species and take what's left of your planet or we can negotiate.

We are requiring an answer within one of your days. Until then we are taking your frozen continent and landing our civilian ships there. Any aggressive move will be met with extinction force.

Reply sent back to invasion spacecraft:

We will allow you thirty days to repair your civilian spacecraft on our southernmost continent. However you must allow an inspection team within 7 days. The inspection team will be accompanied by a negotiation team. Our governments compute that we are on equal levels now. We still have weapons in reserve and will hold them until a decision is made.

Some of our governments only desire your technology. Others are more concerned about your civilian population.

About the Author

I've loved westerns and science fiction since I picked up my first book at the public library.

I've been writing on my computer for years. I never planned on any of my stories being published, just to be read by myself, family, and friends. The base journal is on forty spreadsheets with links to about a thousand files of short one day paragraphs plus other stories.

Now my nephew George is published and he encouraged me to publish also. I've to a lot of work to do. As you know family either loves or hates what you do, so any **criticism** will be appreciated, either at my mail to address or on my Smashwords page. As I gain experience rewriting and reformatting my writings, they will read better, and I hope you enjoy them all!
