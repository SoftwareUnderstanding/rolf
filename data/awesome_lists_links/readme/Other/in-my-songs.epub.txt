How Wonderful You Are

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

Turn on the lights and close the door

I see myself in the mirror

I'm thinking so hard what to do with my life

Memories don't fade away.

Verse 2:

Day after day I don't know the truth

I can't believe that I didn't say a word

But you still hear what I say to you

About the choice that I didn't have.

Chorus:

How wonderful you made me feel

How wonderful you are pleased to see me

How wonderful you changed the ways as I do.

Verse 3:

We're in the restaurant having a cup of coffee

We start talking about our relationships and having many laughs

But the conversation turns much funnier as it was before

We keep on talking until the following day.

Verse 4:

We went on a journey to the place that we've been to before

(How Wonderful)

I can see everybody crossing the street

(How Wonderful)

But they don't say hello to either of us

(How Wonderful)

So we've decided to have a good night out in the town

(How Wonderful)

There's no time to love and there's no time to waste

And there's no time for me to give it all up to you.

Love Don't Change Your Mind

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

Verse 1:

(Male)

Everytime you left me

I could see the tears coming from your eyes

It was just my fault that you mistakenly said

About our love was on the rocks.

(Female):

On the day you came into my world

And I was surprised to see you for the first time

I know it was true when you looked at me

The romance that we share has slowly begun.

Chorus:

(Male and Female)

Love don't change your mind

I feel the passion burning inside your heart

Sometimes you take our love away for granted

It doesn't feel to show what's the best is yet to come for you

But I don't believe that we ever meant to be.

Verse 2:

(Female)

I had another man in my life

He promises to keep in touch every day

It was just like a dream when I open my eyes

And see what happened to you a day before.

(Male)

I was deeply concerned that you were already in love

Maybe it was OK for you to find the other guy

You and I are together and I know that our love has come to an emotional start

But we have to hold on and I'll always be at your side.

Chorus:

(Male and Female)

Love don't change your mind

I feel the passion burning inside your heart

Sometimes you take our love away for granted

It doesn't feel to show what's the best is yet to come for you

But I don't believe that we ever meant to be.

Bridge:

(Male)

Turn on the lights and you must come to me right now

We'll share our wonderful moments together as you and I.

(Female)

But I know it was right to start all over again.

(Male and Female)

We promised that our love will be always new

But my mind doesn't seemed to change your love.

Chorus with Vocal Ad-libs:

(Male and Female)

Love don't change your mind

I feel the passion burning inside your heart

Sometimes you take our love away for granted

It doesn't feel to show what's the best is yet to come for you

Love don't change your mind

I feel the passion burning inside your heart

Sometimes you take

Sometimes you take

Sometimes you take our love away, our love away

But I don't believe

But I don't believe

But I don't believe that we ever meant

Love

Love don't change love

My mind doesn't seemed

My mind doesn't seemed to change your love

I need love, I need love, I need love

Oh love, oh my love oooooh ooooooh.

Never Do You Wrong

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

(Intro)

(All)

Hee....

Chorus:

(All)

Never do you wrong

How many times have you felt bad

Never do you wrong

How many times have you cried

Never do you wrong

Why don't you love me anymore

Never do you wrong

Please don't go 'cause I love you so.

Verse 1:

(Female)

I've been waiting for you to come along

I'm expecting to see you any minute now

You got me hooked when we had a serious talk

I know it's going to be very real

When it finished I went up the stairs

I managed to get myself in the room

Everything changed when you came into my life

You didn't realize that I was here for you.

Chorus:

(All)

Never do you wrong

How many times have you felt bad

Never do you wrong

How many times have you cried

Never do you wrong

Why don't you love me anymore

Never do you wrong

Please don't go 'cause I love you so.

Verse 2:

(Female)

Turn on the fire and let it burn through the night

You put your arms around me and hold me close

We know that everything's turned upside down

When you ask me for a quicker divorce

Sooner or later I get a call from someone I know

They say could you get there on time to see you again

And you arrived earlier than expected

I didn't realize that you were here for me.

Chorus:

(All)

Never do you wrong

How many times have you felt bad

Never do you wrong

How many times have you cried

Never do you wrong

Why don't you love me anymore

Never do you wrong

Please don't go 'cause I love you so.

Bridge:

(Female)

You don't change my mind

Because I want to stay tonight

Maybe it's just a fact

That you are in love with me

I can do no wrong

But you can't love me anymore.

Ad-libs:

(All)

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never.

Rap:

(Male)

'Cause you see I'm a good guy who knows about these things

I couldn't sleep all night but I did somehow

You know that I always listened to that Chic sound

Bring back Good Times and say Le Freak to all the guys there

That funky guitar sound has always inspired me from its beginning

Bernard and Nile are the brave musicians as we know

We want your love from each one of you

And let the disco flow until the break of dawn

I danced to the cool simple beat

When the DJ played it very high

All the gangstas and mommas have come out to play

Cool sensitive stuff they bought

Every time I hear good damn funk music

From Sly Stone to James Brown

We take you behind the groove

And we never do you good come on.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs:

(Female)

Never do you wrong

How many times have you felt bad

Never do you wrong

How many times have you cried

Never do you wrong

Why don't you love me anymore

Never do you wrong

Please don't go 'cause I love you so.

Never do you wrong

How many times have you felt bad

Never do you wrong

How many times have you cried

Never do you wrong

Why don't you love me anymore

Never do you wrong

Please don't go 'cause I love you so.

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you wrong

Never do you....

# PART TIME LOVE

(Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane and Samuel Capri 2007)

Chorus:

She was my part time lover

She was a beautiful angel

She was my part time lover

She was a good girl.

With a warm smile

Verse 1:

When she got home from work I was in the living room waiting

Then she sat down next to me

And she told me so tenderly

That she was going out with another man

I couldn't believe it was true, so I told her that she must go 2 him right now.

But I felt my heart was breaking like glass hitting the floor

And shattering 4 she was

Chorus- Repeat

Verse 2:

She reminded me what we had was great,

That she must end it with her former lover.

But I had a funny feeling that there was something more to this

So that night we both went to a fancy restaurant

I was waiting for her to arrive

And her car pulled up outside of the restaurant

Then she was pleased to see me again

And we kissed twice then,

I held her in my arms so tenderly for a while

Chorus- Repeat

Bridge:

We went to the bar with the other guys

We sat down and had a drink

She went to the stage and sang a little blues number

I hear her voice and it sounds like Janis Joplin.

(Instrumental)

Verse 3:

She took me home, after spending the night together

I was a bit tired but not so hung over

She was OK and didn't want to get sick

I know you still love me, and I'll always be loving you.

Chorus- Repeat

You are my part time love

You are my part time love

You are my part time love

You were a good girl

With a warm smile.

The Lead and How To Swing It

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2009

A cappella:

I'm the leader and I swing it

It's the best thing I can do.

(Intro with ad-libs))

Verse 1:

I didn't have a good night last night

When I was out in town

There was fighting going on

I know I had to stop them from hurting each other

Some men turned away

And the others I have to separate

The guards are coming through the door

And I tell them what they have to do.

Bridge:

My passion has always been dancing

I have been doing this all my life

I know I had to rock your body

And we jump to the beat

Just get to the dance floor

And teach me how to dance.

Chorus:

I'm the leader and I swing it

It's the best thing I can do.

I need your lovin'

You are the leader and you swing it

It's the best way you can do.

You better count on me baby

I'm the leader and I swing it

When you are dancing all alone yeah

I'm the leader and I swing it

It's the best thing I can do

I want to be your superfreak.

(Vocal ad-libs)

Verse 2:

I hit the dancing class

All the girls were surprised to see me

When I come home after a hard day's work.

To dance with somebody who loves me

We can do dirty dancing

And I lift my baby so high

We step it up to the top

Until we have a winner

I've had the time of my life

And I owe it all to you.

Rap:

It's good when we swing it

When you teach me how to dance

If you do the foxtrot or tango

You better follow me with a waltz

Conga is fun to do

But the rhythm is going to get you

The clock strikes ten

The party is in a good mood

And no one puts you in the corner come on.

You Give Me Freedom

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

There's a place

Just down the open highway

We travelled a long way

And we try to look for a shelter

We do our best to live here

We look for the clothes to wear

And food to eat every day

We have to keep our identities secret

So that no one knows about us

There's only one chance for us to live

Our homeland is totally deserted.

Chorus:

You give me freedom

You give me some tender love

You give me strength to carry on

You give me a chance to live and learn in this world

You give me courage to achieve

You just reach out and touch somebody's hand.

Verse 2:

There's a hope for you to call everyone

And gather them round

We had to solve everybody's problems

And carry precious gifts to loved ones

We sang songs to the relatives every night

After our day is done

Now people don't suffer when it's hot

And now people don't die when it's cold

We are hoping to cross the bridge when it's clear and safe

When it's not so dangerous to go through

We have to hold on until it's safe to go

To the place we will live forever.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs:

You give me freedom

You give me some tender love

You give me strength to carry on

You give me reason to live

You give me a choice to decide

You give me freedom

You give me peace

You give and show me some respect

You give me a chance to live and learn in this world

You give me courage to achieve

You just reach out and touch somebody's hand.

Bridge with vocal ad-libs:

Brothers and sisters

Holding hands one by one

We stand together

And we must fight to survive

A new day will come any moment now.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs:

You give me freedom

You give me some tender love

You give me strength to carry on

You give me reason to live

You give me a choice to decide

You give me freedom

You give me peace

You give and show me some respect

You give me a chance to live and learn in this world

You give me courage to achieve

You just reach out and touch somebody's hand.

Knockin'

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

Chorus:

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

Verse 1:

You said it doesn't really matter about the truth

I said you have been hurting yourself

Blood comes out of your veins

And it simply drips on to the floor

You were desparate to let yourself down

I was totally unhappy about you and your stupid lies

Your life was already in decline

And the reason that you defend me

Bridge:

So tell me baby

Are we going to fight each other?

Please don't come back no more.

Chorus:

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

Verse 2:

Sooner or later I took many calls in one day

It's much more important if I have lots of plans

It's just a game when you turn me off

And I said that's enough and you will have to go

I hate you more than I love you

You didn't refuse to say it at all

If I say it one more time when you have to go

And I don't want to hear anything from you.

Bridge:

So tell me baby

Are we still lovers or not?

Please don't come back no more.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs:

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

Bridge with lead vocal ad-libs:

Please baby I see you knocking on the door three times

I push you away and say stay out of my sight

You gave me everything that I need

I'll swear if you promise me that you'll never do it again.

(Lead vocal and instrumental ad-libs)

Chorus with lead vocal and instrumental ad-libs):

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

I heard you knockin' on my door

I'm afraid I'll have to let you in

I heard you kickin'on my door

I want you to get out

And don't come back no more.

Is It Really Love Enough?

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

(Intro)

(Ad-libs)

Verse 1:

(Female)

I remember when I came home one night

When someone came to tell me off

About lies and personal affairs

I felt it was too bad for me to get through

Talking about conversations that you had before

But maybe I can start all over again.

(Male)

I saw you walking down the street

But I didn't know it was you

I thought you were my only one

But now I need to know who you are.

Chorus:

(Female and male)

We must have respect

To care for each other

We must have justice to protect

We need to know that we are safe.

(Female)

I can't go on without you my love.

(Female and male)

Is it really love enough?

(Ad-libs)

Verse 2:

(Male)

Everytime you were there

I would keep my eye on you darling

To make sure you were doing fine

It's just the same old story

About two of us having a wonderful life together

Maybe it was like a dream.

(Female)

We have to move on and go on

But baby I need you by my side

It's never too late though we came to a dead end

We didn't know what to do.

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Bridge:

(Male)

It's not enough to say

You were my angel in disguise

Should I take a chance and live as a part of your fantasy?

(Female)

It's OK for you to shut my mouth

We just say goodnight.

(Female and male)

And I'm heading out the door.

(Harmonica Solo with vocal ad-libs)

Chorus with ad-libs – Repeat till fade

I Don't Need Another Love Like That

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

It never felt this way

And I know what is happening

I see it in your eyes

You know it is a truth to see it through

Every time when I look at you

On the day when we first met

It might seem to be much easier

For you and I

There are no words that you could say.

Chorus:

I don't need another love like that

I just can't go on when you keep running out of my time

So there's a choice that you will have for a while

You don't need another heart like mine

Before you can say that love cannot be denied

Think again and remember all these memories that I've dreamt of.

Verse 2:

Life is almost different

When the time is changing

I noticed it was yesterday

But today remains the same

I never knew when everything was wrong

But I couldn't get up to change the time

While I was doing that it went back to normal

Once again

I felt that I couldn't work it out.

Chorus - Repeat

It might seem to be much easier

For you and I

There are no words that you could say.

Chorus – repeat till fade

I Can't Be Loved

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

Verse 1:

I don't want to hurt my feelings for you

When you kiss me goodbye and walk away

The room seems so cold and my heart is slowly melting

So I couldn't love someone else.

Verse 2:

Now that I'm alone with no one at my side

I couldn't face the truth by saying nothing at all

It may have changed so quickly when I was barely able to speak

But I couldn't say another word

I need to be loved but I can't be.

Chorus:

I want to be loved by you

You are so special in my life

'Cause I need to explain

When someone broke my heart in two

I felt sad without you

I can't be loved.

(Vocal ad-libs)

Verse 3:

I haven't heard anything from you

Since you went away not long ago

I have to change my name to something different

I'll have an identity that you will know.

Verse 4:

I managed to leave and walk out the door quite quickly

But you come back to reclaim me

I didn't know that you were here

And that you had something to say

I need to be loved but you can't.

Chorus:

I want to be loved by you

You are so special in my life

'Cause I need to explain

When someone broke my heart in two

I felt sad without you

I can't be loved.

(Vocal ad-libs)

Bridge:

You hurt me so badly

When I tried to get you out

You pushed me to the ground

And I hurt myself

You are the biggest fool that I've ever met in my life.

(Instrumental Break with Vocal ad-libs)

I need to be loved but I can't be.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs:

I want to be loved by you

You are so special in my life

'Cause I need to explain

When someone broke my heart in two

I felt sad without you

I want to be loved by you

You are so special in my life

'Cause I need to explain

When someone broke my heart in two

I felt sad without you

I can't be loved

I want to be loved by you

You are so special in my life

'Cause I need to explain

When someone broke my heart....

Fall Again

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

(Intro)

(Ad-libs)

Verse 1:

(Male)

Every time I close my eyes

I feel the sight, a vision inside

Please don't look back when you're afraid.

I'll hold you so tenderly

I know that you love me so much

And I'll always be at your side.

Bridge:

(Female)

When I look into your eyes

And see what I feel is you

I know it's you and you are my only one

We didn't believe in miracles

Until one winter night when we walked in a frosty breeze

You gave your trust to me.

Chorus:

(All)

I don't wanna fall again right now

I want to get close to you

When you put your arms around me

It feels so bad when I'm lonely

You better keep my faith alive

If I never let you down.

Verse 2:

(Female)

I look out the bedroom window

Watching people passing by

They believe that they are in a rush

I notice every one of them seem to be strangers

They never talk to me

So how would I understand.

Bridge:

(Male)

When I looked into your face

It was very pale and cold

You came in from the afternoon storm

We always believed in happiness

We walked together you and I in a warm starry night

It's good to share the feeling.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs:

(All)

I don't wanna fall again right now

I want to get close to you

When you put your arms around me

It feels so bad when I'm lonely

You better keep my faith alive

If I never let you down

I don't wanna fall again right now

I want to get close to you

When you put your arms around me

It feels so bad when I'm lonely

You better keep my faith alive

If I never let you down.

Bridge:

(Male)

Here and now

You must never break these rules

In order to keep our scarifice

And divine emotions.

(Female)

Now and then

We could be anywhere

Please darling I will live for you

And you will live for me.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs (Repeat till fade):

Classy Seduction

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

(Spoken Word Introduction taken from the film 'Class')

(Instrumental intro and ad-libs)

Spoken Verse 1:

(Male 1)

When I walked in to the bar one night

I sat across one side and you sat on the other

I think that you are so beautiful and you get to know me quite well

Everything is so special and we had a good life together

You promise me not to say I love you too much

We had to flee and go wandering through the night

I hold you in my arms again and you promise me to stay

But you don't know everything about me.

Spoken Chorus:

Classy seduction

Spoken Verse 2:

(Female)

Don't worry darling it's going to be alright

I'll let you settle down for a while

You never seemed to take a chance with anyone like me

But I know it's true when you are all alone

I want you to get out of my property, soon as you can

You stand beside these gates as I'm telling you to leave

However, you aren't bothered so I want you to go now

And to keep away out of my sight.

Chill Factor

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

Chorus:

If you give me a chill factor

Then you keep me warm

If you give me some passion baby

Please tell me that I love you more.

If you give me a chill factor

Then you keep me warm

If you give me some passion baby

Please tell me that I love you more.

Verse 1:

Into the sunrise

As I make love to you

Your body is close to mine

We see our crystal ball glittering in the daylight

I know what's going on with you baby

You have just opened the curtains and let the fresh air in

I want to hold and touch you all the time

As we continue to make love when the day comes.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs – Repeat 2x

Verse 2:

Looking ahead to the future

As I spend my quiet time alone

You went away on your travels

And I managed to look after your belongings

When you came home weeks later

I was in the room checking out some information

You walked around my back and patted me on my shoulder

I knew that you seemed to be my dear old friend.

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs – Repeat 2x

Ad-libs:

Give me a chill factor

And I'll let you go

I want to know that you are safe

Give me a chill factor

I know that you are here

Just give me one more try.

(Instrumental and vocal ad-libs)

Chorus with ad-libs – Repeat till fade

Gimme Some Fever

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2009

(Intro with vocal ad-libs)

(Ad-libs):

Gimme

Gimme some fever

Gimme

Gimme some fever

Verse 1:

(Male)

Driving alone in my car

I'm heading for my own destination

So that I can see my baby

I turn the music on

And I hear the feel good beat

Of the song I can remember

I know it's getting late

I have to get home right now

But the phone keeps on ringing

I just ignore it and focus on what I'm doing

My baby would be sleeping

With the lights on

You're supposed to turn them off

And go back to sleep.

Chorus:

(All)

Gimme some fever in the morning

Gimme some fever in the night

It only takes time when you sneeze a lot

Gimme some fever after today

Gimme some fever during the week

It comes and goes every year in the summertime

(Male)

You make me feel so bad

when you caught me cheating with the girl i love

Just gimme whatever you want

So that I can take it for myself

(All)

Would you gimme, gimme some fever.

(Male)

Tonight.

(Vocal ad-libs)

Verse 2:

(Female)

Chilling out with my friends

In the secret garden

where the birds and bees are flying so high

I sit back and relax

While I'm talking to someone I know

It's hot out there in the daytime

I miss you so much now and then

You have been away for a long time

But you should be here by now

so that we can be together forever and always

We never let ourselves down

In our own secret world

You just look at me

In the way that lovers do.

Chorus:

(All)

Gimme some fever in the morning

Gimme some fever in the night

It only takes time when you sneeze a lot

Gimme some fever after today

Gimme some fever when you are on the streets

It comes and goes every year in the summertime

(Female)

The time finally comes right

For you and I to get some fever

in the summer time

We'll run away to our secret garden every day.

(All)

Would you gimme, gimme some fever

(Female)

Right now.

Bridge with vocal ad-libs:

We hide in the shelter

when the birds and bees have disappeared

The clouds gather and there are sheets of rain coming straight down on us

I know that I love you

(Female)

But this time it's for real

(Male and Female)

We are not letting ourselves go.

Off The Hook

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2009

(Instrumental Intro with Lead Vocal Ad-libs)

Verse 1:

I'm tired after a hard day's work

So I sit down and relax for a while

Have a nice glass of wine and a biscuit or two

I'm just getting ready for the night

But I have to take my mobile with me

Just in case it gets lost.

Bridge:

I walk out the door

And head to my fave hotspot

So that I can dance all night long

Mmmmm

I used to be a lovergirl

But not anymore.

Chorus:

Cause I have so many calls

And my phone has been ringing off the hook

Don't worry I won't forget

You left me a text message not long ago

My phone has been ringing off the hook

I know what it is.

Ad-libs:

Your phone has been ringing

Your phone has been ringing off the hook

Your phone has been ringing

Verse 2:

I was supposed to turn it on

At five o'clock in the morning

And I saw one message from someone that I know

Sooner or later I have to be at the party

Visiting that friend who has been texting me

Since 2am in the wee small hours

Bridge:

I thought he was cute

But he turns out to be nasty

He hits me down to the ground

Oooooooo

I managed to get up

And they promise he'll not do it again.

Chorus:

Cause I have so many calls

And my phone has been ringing off the hook

I just left each one of them a message

I'm not tired of calling them

My phone has been ringing off the hook

I don't know why you called me.

Or if you try my number

That's when you'll get through to me

After so many days

And so many nights

I love talking to you on the phone

But you seem not to!.

Chorus:

I'm asking you not to run away

Because your phone has been ringing off the hook

I try to give you advice hee...

Midnight Lover

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

(Intro)

Verse 1:

She went to the club

To see a friend of mine

And she says 'He's too hot and sexy for me'

He whispers in her ear

He says 'I think you are so hot'

He takes her jacket off and they head to the bar.

Bridge:

It's almost midnight

And the music begins to fade

They keep on talking for hours

This will change their lives forever.

Chorus:

She's a midnight lover

She only goes out in the night

She's a perfect stranger

He wants to keep her satisfied

Because she's the one for him.

Verse 2:

I spot her with a man

At the party one night

And she says 'I'm too hot and sexy for him'

I walk over to them

And I say 'I think you two look great together'

I sit down at their table and he tells me who he is.

Bridge:

It's just before midnight

And the party goes on until the early hours

We stay up all night

Until they turn down the lights.

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Bridge:

There's no time to waste for them

They should run away all night

And they won't come back until the morning

And they fall into their bed

He wants to be with her always.

(Tenor sax solo with vocal ad-libs)

Bridge:

It's just before midnight

And the party goes on until the early hours

We stay up all night

Until they turn down the lights.

To see if I'm up for some tender action

We are heading to the club

To have a good time

With good friends of mine

And I have fallen in love with her

I answer her calls and messages

She seemed to be so nice.

I ask her to go out with me tonight

She says she has got other plans

Someone knocks on my door

I rush downstairs to see if anyone is around

When I open the door there were a group of friends

Standing on my doorstep

I'm almost ready to go

But I forgot to bring my sister

Because she wants to come with us

So I call out her name and she appears

I close my door and face the crowd

'Cos I'm your leader and you better follow me.

We'll Be On Our Way

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

(Female 1)

I know the time is coming

I should leave this place and go away

I want to live with someone that I love

My life has just begun

I wish to stay much longer but I can't

Tears come down my face

I'm hoping to break these rules

Any day now

Any day now.

Chorus:

(All)

You'll always be there

And I'll be there for you

You don't forget to ask me some questions

We can hear whispers of the wind

And we see sunshine and rain

I need you and you need me

So that we can be together

I carry the torch for you

And we'll be on our way.

Verse 2:

(Male 1)

It's been a while since I last saw you

My friends have been crazy about you

And it just doesn't go away

I'm hoping to start a new life

With the girl of my dreams

It will happen anytime soon

Any day now

Any day now.

So that I can find you

Any time in any place

And I'll run to you.

It's so hard to do

You can't fight anymore

And you can't break each other's hearts

Let's bury the past

And move on with our lives yeah.

Everywhere I Go With You

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

Everywhere I go with you

If there's anything that you ever need to take with you

I know that my heart feels so much stronger

From now on I'll be your friend and companion.

Verse 2:

Anytime I spent lonely nights

When the night is falling I could see the stars

It's so amazing to see the night sky

How beautiful it can be.

Chorus:

You have to come with me and I'll take you for a ride

We have to stop by to see the places that we love

We're always there and I know that this is the place for the two of us

I need you by my side then we're together.

Verse 3:

Any month I can work so hard

All day and all night long in the same room

I never forget the days going by

But I was thinking about tomorrow or the next day.

Chorus:

You have to come with me and I'll take you for a ride

We have to stop by to see the places that we love

We're always there and I know that this is the place for the two of us

I always remember you my love

Until it's time for us to go anywhere in this world

We will live until the end of time

I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

We have to stop by to see the places that we love

You have to come with me and I'll take you for a ride

We have to stop by to see the places that we love

We're always there and I know that this is the place for the two of us

I need you by my side then we're together

You have to come with me and I'll take you for a ride

We have to stop by to see the places that we love

We're always there and I know that this is the place for two of us

I need you by my side when we're dancing in the crowded ballroom

The crowded ballroom

The crowded ballroom

The crowded ballroom.

Someone Else's Eyes

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

I believe what you said to me

About our own choices that we have planned

We're much too close to this to see what we're doing

But you didn't say that our love came to an end

I was always interested in keeping our promises

And letting us go our separate ways.

Bridge:

The time keeps on changing

You tried to call me several times a week as I know

But it doesn't really matter if you understand me.

Chorus:

I know it was right to say my name

We have to know each other by now

We no longer see each other's faces

We just keep on fighting, living our lives

I'm aware of those problems that you had

But I have to look my own way

And I believe it was someone else's eyes.

Verse 2:

There's the chance for both of us to decide

But we could discuss it a bit later

We are not getting any closer as it all comes to a bitter halt

You can try to answer me once again

It all went much too easily

Our vows could be renewed if we want to

Bridge:

Our life together is fading so fast

We can try to see each other once a week

I know what you meant when you said

The life is so different.

Chorus:

I know it was right to say my name

We have to know each other by now

We no longer see each other's faces

We just keep on fighting, living our lives

I'm aware of those problems that you had

But I have to look my own way

And I believe it was someone else's eyes.

(Instrumental Break)

And we continue bringing our mind, body and soul

To our usual way of happiness.

Chorus:

I know it was right to say my name

We have to know each other by now

We no longer see each other's faces

We just keep on fighting, living our lives

I'm aware of those problems that you had

But I have to look my own way

And I believe it was someone else's eyes.

I know it was right to say my name

We have to know each other by now

We no longer see each other's faces

We just keep on fighting, living our lives

I'm aware of those problems that you had

But I have to look my own way

And I believe it was someone else's eyes.

Tell Me Tomorrow

(Ad-libs)

Verse 1:

I lay beside you

Your body settles next to mine

I look at you

And you smile at me

Our plans didn't work out

So I decided to pick up all the pieces

Then maybe we could start it all over again.

Tell me tomorrow

Tell me tomorrow

Tell me tomorrow

If you will be mine.

(Ad-libs)

Verse 2:

You sit beside me

You've got so many problems

I talk to you from time to time

I still need you by my side

Tell me what went wrong.

Chorus:

Tell me tomorrow

Tell me tomorrow

Tell me tomorrow

If you will be mine.

No Matter What You Say

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

There's nothing like yesterday

When everything passes to the other side

I thought you made a huge mistake

And you would say sorry

Every time you see my face

When I was coming over to see how you were doing

If I would turn back my heels one more time

And walk away from you.

Chorus:

You know when it's all over

We tried to pick up the pieces

And put it back together again

Our love is very hard to find

It has changed somehow

And I will never forget about you

No matter what you say.

Verse 2:

We'll help each other to find our destiny

To save our lives immediately

And I know that we were right to think again

It brings great joy and happiness

Before we could carry on with our lives

There's only one thing we forgot to say

I could say something to you before I go somewhere

And I'll leave you alone without me.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs - Repeat

Bridge:

The fire deepens in our eyes

We shall stand up and stay as we are

There are so many stars in the sky

How beautiful it can be

Tomorrow is the another day

And the new one has just begun.

When My Heart Feels Stronger

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

You never take a chance

So I'm trying to seduce you

But it's only yesterday when you tried to phone me

I never believed it was so hard to make a phone call.

Chorus:

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a warm summer sun

When I kiss your lips so brightly

It always stays the same

Before you kiss me once more.

Verse 2:

Before we managed to speak easily

I got a message from you

It says 'Could you come over to my place tonight?'

I would agree to come but I've got lots of plans.

Chorus:

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a warm summer sun

When I kiss your lips so brightly

It always stays the same

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a cold winter night

When you kiss my lips so brightly

It always stays the same

Before I kiss you once more.

Bridge:

There are times that we spoke over and over

About the different reasons we have come to terms with

It doesn't seem to show right now

But we agree to talk a bit more about it.

(Key Change)

Chorus:

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a warm summer sun

When I kiss your lips so brightly

It always stays the same

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a cold winter night

When you kiss my lips so brightly

It always stays the same

Before I kiss you once more.

When my heart feels stronger

Every time I'm relaxing in a warm summer sun

When you kiss my lips so brightly

It always stays the same

Before I kiss you once more

Before I kiss you once more

Before I kiss you once more.

A Love Will Never Last

 Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

There is a time for all of us

When the war had just begun

We were told to get up

Pack our belongings

A soldier looks in the window

When he sees people leaving so quickly

The rest came down to see what was happening

They got themselves together and lead the way into the ghetto.

Chorus:

Someday it might be a love that will never last

Someday it might be tomorrow is another day

Someday it might be a love that didn't come

Someday it might be a choice

Verse 2:

We boarded the train

We headed to our country

The streets were blocked

We tried to get in

We manage to go another way

And we eventually hide in the shelter

The soldiers come nearer to my people

Killing them one by one

We have to run away and cross the barrier to the shed

Then I know that everything is OK.

Chorus:

Someday it might be a love that will never last

Someday it might be tomorrow is another day

Someday it might be a love that didn't come

Someday it might be a choice

Bridge:

I want to explain our feelings for each other

We promised that we wouldn't get hurt

All the walls come down

Children are dying

There's only one hope to survive before we are carried away.

(Instrumental break)

Chorus:

Someday it might be a love that will never last

Someday it might be tomorrow is another day

Someday it might be a love that didn't come

Someday it might be a choice

Someday it might be a love that will never last

Someday it might be tomorrow is another day

Someday it might be a love that didn't come

Someday it might be a choice.

Down That Road

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Chorus:

I walk down that road

I need you by my side

I had to cross the river and climb the mountains

I don't wanna lose you

And I don't want to say goodbye

Verse 1:

It's one o'clock in the morning

And the sky is so clear

I've had trouble sleeping

So I had to stay up all night

I tried to get out of the house but the door is always locked

I had to get the key from someone and then I opened the door

Don't worry my friend it's going to be alright

And I'll hold you in my arms once more.

Chorus - Repeat

Verse 2:

Tonight I have something special just for you

It turned out to be one of these secrets that we kept for years

Come on baby let me show you the way I move

Let's just take it slow as the music takes us down to a soft groove

I know it was true when you were afraid

Come on honey I'll keep you warm until the fire heats you up.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs – Repeat 2x

Bridge:

Sooner or later you could take my life away

But it hasn't happened just yet

Everything needs to be sorted right now

And we are not going to be separated.

Can't Let This Feeling Go

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

Verse 1:

Here we are at last staying together

I know it was right to change the mood

Two of us share some tender moments in the dark

And the music plays under the candlelight

Tonight when we make love

As the sun goes down at night.

Chorus:

I always believed in everything you need

You kiss my lips so gently but push us apart

You brought me a great joy that I will never forget

Don't break my heart to pieces

And I can't let this feeling go.

Verse 2:

I didn't need to rush when we said hello

But then you changed my life

I'll always be there for you when you come over at night

And we're going to stay together

Tonight when we make love

As the music begins to play before the morning starts.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs - Repeat

Bridge:

Someday I'll see you again

Another time when you're around

Perhaps you will find me in the another place

I don't believe it was what you want but somehow it will change.

Now That I Have Found Love

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

I'm looking for someone

With a warm smile

I sit down and think about it

While I spoke to this guy I know

I ask him for some advice on what I'm going to do

About who would be a perfect match for me

So I have to get ready for a good night out

To try to do my best to find him

I take my coat and walk out the door

And I'll be gone for few hours.

Chorus:

Now that I have found love

With someone like you

I have found happiness

With someone I can trust

Now that I have found someone who will love me forever

I'll be good to you ... my love.

Verse 2:

I notice you in the nightclub

Talking to another girl

I come over and tell her to go away

You were not disappointed when she left

I sit down next to you and explain what's happened

Somehow it will not happen again

You realize that someone who used to be with you

She tried to kiss you again but without so much pain

Stop being so shy you can leave her alone

I can have you if I want to.

Chorus – Repeat

Now that I have found love

With someone like you

I have found happiness

With someone I can trust

Now that I have found someone who will keep me warm

Every day and every night

Now that I have found love

With a man in my life

I have found blessings

From someone I do know

Now that I have found someone who will love me forever

I'll be good to you ... my love

Bridge:

I know it's true when you are with me

And I don't wanna lose you

Everything will be safe here tonight

When we open the door and see what's inside.

Chorus – Repeat till fade

Right Back Where You Started

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

I hear the noise sounding from the room

Outside the hallway

I managed to get up and put on my slippers

And went downstairs to see what's going on

I opened the door

And I saw baggage on the floor

I expect someone is packing

And yes you are.

Chorus:

I'll take you right back where you started

I'll take you right back where you started

I'll take you right back where you started

To the place you were born

To the place you were born.

Verse 2:

I offered to help you carry your things

To the taxi

It's so cold outside

Rain came pouring down

We hid underneath the coats

We didn't get wet when we got in the taxi

We told the driver where we are going.

Chorus:

I'll take you right back to your beloved country

I'll take you right back to your beloved country

I'll take you right back to your beloved country

Where you were bought up

Where you were bought up

Where you were bought up.

We slept all the way

To the far away place

We've been to before.

Chorus:

I'll take you right back where you started

I'll take you right back where you started

I'll take you right back where you started

To a place you call home

Sweet Surrender

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

She came to my place a year ago

Everyone was pleased to welcome her on board

We noticed she was the luckiest person we had

I knew she must be so smart

She and her friend Jenny went to bars and clubs

They met very good friends on the way

They hit it off on the dancefloor

Having a good time

She reckons that she is the best friend in her life

She holds her breath and closes her eyes

She dreams of finding the right man to love

She takes her sweet surrender and promises to him a gift that might be hers

She works hard for the money she gets

Every time she comes to work

She is brave for helping all the men in the house

In 2 houses in the place we live

Chorus – Repeat

(Instrumental Break)

I wrote this song specially for you

Because you are my fire

I want to keep your irons every day

We are together on the desert island

With lots of people who are survivors

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Ad-libs – Repeat till fade:

I'm gonna take your sweet surrender

My world is filled with pride and joy

I'm gonna take your sweet surrender

A gift that might be yours.

Say somethin', say somethin' to me

Say somethin', say somethin' to me

Say somethin', say somethin' to me

Say somethin', say somethin' to me.

Verse 1:

You need to show some respect

When I ask you to be nice

I thought you did something wrong

So I know it's you when you are feeling alright

I couldn't stand up when you told me to

I had to walk there and back again

I need a good rest after a long journey

I put my head on my pillow and go to sleep

Taste like butterflies

Stronger than a mountain

I just watch your back

How dare you,

How dare you scream my name.

Chorus:

Go on say somethin'

You say somethin' nice to me

Go on say somethin'

I say somethin' nice to you baby

Go on say somethin'

You say somethin' nice to me

Go on say somethin'

I'll hit you up to the top.

Verse 2:

I know it's very late

We need to go back immediately

'Cause our mates are doing their dancing turn

At the low-key assembly tonight

Once we arrive there the place is busy

Everybody's gearing up for the celebration

The curtain is going up and the show starts

You make it hot for me and I'll make it hot for you too

Colder than winter

Brighter than sunrise

You just watch my back

How dare you,

How dare you scream my name.

Chorus:

Go on say somethin'

You say somethin' nice to me

Go on say somethin'

I say somethin' nice to you baby

Go on say somethin'

You say somethin' nice to me

Go on say somethin'

I'll hit you up to the top.

Go on say somethin'

I say somethin' nice to you baby

Go on say somethin'

You say somethin' good to me

Go on say somethin'

Just say somethin'

Please sugar you gotta keep me satifised.

When you went over to end it

I'm disappointed that you made a mistake

But glad it's over now.

Let's make tonight the night

For such sweet tender passion

Caress me with your kisses

It burns like a fire

Turn down the lights

I feel the slightest touch

Come on baby I'll make you feel right.

Tonight we'll try to make it right darling.

Your long lasting struggle has just been lost

From the bottom of my heart I thank you for caring and watching me

Trying to think to myself

When the rain comes down I sit there doing nothing

I felt so miserable without my family at my side.

Chorus:

Men In Chains

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

There's something going on

In our country

Our lives have been shattered

By the outbreak of war

It's 1939 and we were supposed

To get ready for a day

Many shops and places closed

And many roads deserted.

Chorus:

There were men in chains (chains)

Walking down the street one by one

Men in chains (chains)

See us outside the window.

Verse 2:

The guards marched

Past Leicester Square

We are forced to hide

Underneath the blankets

We run many miles

To the train station

We get the tickets

And we jump right on the train.

Chorus:

But we see men in chains (chains)

Sitting on the passenger seats

Men in chains (chains)

Tell us to go away

Verse 3:

They don't see us

As we go undercover

We searched every seat one after another

In two separate ways

Men in chains (chains) walk past between us

We didn't even know they were here

So we went back to sit down in our seats

And to keep our mouths shut.

Chorus:

Men in chains (chains)

Sitting in the front of us

Men in chains (chains)

Don't say a word.

Verse 4 with guitar ad-libs:

They take us hostage

By putting their guns on our heads

They tell us to get down

On our knees and close our eyes

We pray to our Heavenly Father

So that we won't die before them

The train takes us to our destination

It's jammed with a crowd of people.

Chorus with guitar ad-libs:

Men in chains (chains)

Got off the train

The police catch and arrest

Men in chains (chains)

They took them away

To the police station

Sooner or later they are in prison.

Love's So Good To Me

© Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2005

(This song is dedicated to Sarah Cowling)

Verse 1:

I saw you in the canteen one morning with your friend

You were talking to each other face to face

The lines that you both said were linked to the same conversation

Your friend seems to be bright when you talk to her quietly

You are not happy when you've got a lesson to do any minute

I think that we shall go up to our classes before 9am.

Chorus:

Love's so good to me

Your love is so very good to me

Your sweet love is so good to me

Love holds your heart tonight

Love's so good to me

Your love is so very good to me

Your love is so good to me

Love does exist ever more.

Verse 2:

We sat outside when it was cool and breezy

We talked to each other when you were on your own

I never felt this way before until you changed my life completely

You didn't want me to be your boyfriend because you have already got one

Time after time when we met each other

You would run away from me before I try to catch you.

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Bridge:

You come home from work every day

Your family are waiting for you to sit down at the table

They laugh and talk all the way through their supper every night

You don't feel so good when you've got a headache.

Talkin' Bout A Revolution

(Martin Luther King spoken word intro)

(Instrumental intro)

Verse 1:

Let's talk bout peace

When the war has just begun

Let's talk bout prejudice

When there's a crime to commit

Let's talk bout that time

You saved my life the night before

Let's talk bout when my brother was killed by the hunter

Who gets captured by the game.

You put a trust in me

When I call your name

It's been a long time since we last spoke

So we just sit down and

Chorus:

Let's talk bout trust

Let's talk bout truth

Let's talk bout hopes, dreams and sacrifice

Let's talk bout the day Tony Blair came into power

When we are so excited to travel abroad

And let's talk bout when I had a one night stand

With a girl who was too young to smoke.

You put a faith in me

When I put my arms so high

It's been a while since we last spoke

I just sit at my computer and I don't know what to say.

Chorus:

How about talking bout democracy

Talk bout law and justice

Talk bout sex, drugs and rock 'n'roll

Talk bout royalty

Talk bout pollution

Talk bout anything to do with love

Talk bout a revolution

Talk bout a revolution

Revolution

Talk bout a revolution

Revolution.

(George W. Bush spoken word interlude)

Bridge:

I can't get any books to read

I can't get any tickets for the Broadway show

I can't get any sleep

Because the music plays too loud next door

I don't know what's going on

I suggest the neighbours turn the volume down.

(Tony Blair spoken word interlude)

Verse 3:

Talk bout revenge

When you kill somebody

Talk bout when the World Trade Center came down

After two planes crashed into the twin towers.

Someone sits down next to me

And I know what you said.

Will You Marry Me?

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

(Instrumental Intro)

Verse 1:

The first time I saw you

You were driving down the street

I stopped what I was doing to see your face

You smiled at me

You took me to a café

Having a drink and chatting all that time

I surely agreed you are so attractive

With a good strong heart.

Bridge:

It's been several months since my lover and I separated

We were so close to each other every now and then

I feel so lonely now

But I need someone to love

Chorus:

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Verse 2:

You and your lover split up a short time ago

Then afterwards I met you by accident

You were very disappointed when you came home that night

And found your lover in bed with another girl

You told her to get out of the house

He put on his clothes and headed to the bathroom

You ran downstairs to make a phone call

Because it's very urgent.

Bridge:

It's been several months since you and your lover separated

You were so close to each other every now and then

You feel so lonely now

But you need someone to love.

Chorus:

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Will you marry me?

Bridge:

From the moment you woke up

You found your lover gone

So you had to pack your belongings

And write him a note to tell him you are leaving today.

(Key change)

You are leaving today.

Verse 3:

She's on her way to find me

I know the time when she's coming

So I had to go to buy her an engagement ring

And a bunch of flowers

She might be at the train station looking for me

I have to run to find her

She turns around to see me holding the box

I know she was surprised

I knelt on one knee and put the ring on your finger

This will last forever

And I say.....

Chorus with lead vocal ad-libs:

Will you marry me?

Ordinary Girl

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

(Intro)

Chorus:

I'm an ordinary girl

And I live in an ordinary world

My life seems so real

I'm an ordinary woman

And I go anywhere in this world

I want to share those moments with you.

Verse 1:

I have been looking for something

When I'm alone in my room

All of a sudden I have found the key to free myself

I even knew it's nearer to winter

The sun has already disappeared

I found myself freezing to death in the cold icy air.

Verse 2:

I mostly stayed in the other side of my home

The lights are already on

And I went inside to spend my time alone

I hear these voices calling out my name

But one of them notices me in my room

You just leave me alone in peace.

Chorus - Repeat

Verse 3:

Spring blossoms outside

We managed to come out and play

I was the one who kicked the boys out

They didn't like it at all

So I would change the game to something interesting

And they don't even know what's going to happen next.

Verse 4:

I just bought my new guitar the other day

And I took it home with me

I even sat down with it and played a few notes of this song

Then I played it for my friends

They seemingly loved it from the beginning

And one of them told me to play it again.

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Bridge:

Listen sugar I'm an ordinary girl

And I choose how to live my life

I kept my promise, my gift to you

You want to live in your ordinary world

But I would love to come to live with you

And that's how it's going to be.

Chorus – Repeat 2x

Ad-libs:

I want to be just ordinary

I want to have a normal life

I want to be just ordinary

I want to be just ordinary

I want to have a normal life

I want to be just ordinary

I want to have a normal life

I want to be just ordinary

I want to have a normal life

Things We Used To Be

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2008

Verse 1:

(Female 1)

When I got up in the morning

The alarm kept on buzzing

I had to turn it off

So that my parents could get some sleep

I put on my jumper

And I combed my beautiful hair

They didn't hear my footsteps

When I left my room

I put my clothes in the washing machine

And I sat down in the kitchen

Listening to The Moldy Peaches on my walkman

While I ate my breakfast,

I picked up some mail and read it in my living room

These letters are so special to me.

Chorus:

(Female 1)

So I pick up my guitar and play it every day

I close my eyes and hear songs in my head

So I write them down one by one in my notebook

Yeah, that's one of the things I do.

Verse 2:

(Male 1)

Since the last time I saw you

I have few problems on my own

My best friend beats me up on a cold winter night

I don't know what's happened

When I was lying in the snow

I managed to pull myself up

And walk over to my place.

Once I got in there were guys and gals having a great time

I'm surprised that they chill and relax in a special way

And there was you sitting on the sofa

I sat down next to you and we kissed so tenderly

You pick up your guitar and we sing.

Chorus:

(1 male and 1 female)

We cuddle together every night

The moon is shining in the sky

We embrace each other while the others are asleep

Yeah, that's one of the things we do.

That's one of the things we do....

Bridge:

(Female)

I went to the doctor one morning after I felt sick

I explained to the doctor what had happened to me.

(Male)

Your parents will be mad when you come home that day

(Female and Male)

What were they expecting?

Chorus:

(1 Female and 1 Male)

Our parents, family and friends are glad that our child is on its way

We share the good news with the rest of the world

We sit at the table drinking a toast to us and our future

And that's one of the things we do.

We cuddle up together every night

The full moon shining in the sky

We embrace each other while the others are fast asleep

Yeah, that's one of the things we do.

(1 female)

We are going to keep our child to ourselves from now on.

(1 female and 1 male)

And that's one of the things

And that's one of the things

Yeah, that's one of the things we do.

And that's one of the things.....

What Are We Gonna Do?

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2009

Chorus:

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What are we gonna do

When you are in heaven

What were we gonna do

When you were around.

Verse 1:

(Rapper)

I've known you for a long time

Since we first met at school

When we were six years old

On a hot summer's day in September

We were in the same class

With our faithful friends

We stuck together, one to the another

For many years

I love and adore you

When you were in our house

We'd go outside

To play with our fave toys

Sometimes you got homework

Some hard and some easy

I know it was so diffcult

But you can try to work it out.

Chorus:

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What are we gonna do

When you are in heaven

What were we gonna do

When you were around

What were we gonna do

When you were in love

What were we gonna do

When you had confessions to make

We can't be together without you.

Verse 2:

(Rapper)

10 years later we were still there

Going to school as usual

We were in the same class

With our wonderful friends

We took our time to complete our work

Before we moved on to something else

But you got caught up in a love affair

With an older woman twice your age

You and your lover had many romantic adventures

Non stop from the beginning to the end

You can't take your eyes off her

Because she's hot and sexy

After the party one night

You know what you want her to do

Just take her clothes off and get to bed

And you fucked her all night long come on.

Chorus:

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What are we gonna do

When you are in heaven

(Singer 1)

You had a good life.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were around

(Singer 1)

You were a crazy party animal.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were in love.

(Singer 1)

I knew I loved you.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you had confessions to make

We can't be together without you.

Verse 3:

(Rapper)

After you split up from your lover

You went through the rough times

Being expelled from school was not a good thing

We knew you were in trouble

You bought yourself a bedsit

Which was one room with a bed

You got a job sometime later

But it didn't go as well as it was planned.

You were hoping to become a good dad

When she told you that she was expecting a child

She explained everything to you

So that you understand

When she came home one night

She didn't know you were not there

You rushed to the hospital just in time

To see something's wrong

I know you were not so good

The pain has been killing you

Just take your time and relax.

Bridge:

(Singer 2)

We were watching TV one night

And saw something was funny

We couldn't believe it happened to the man on the screen

I made a hot drink for you

When you went to your room

I knew something was wrong

I tried to call an ambulance

I raced back to your room with water in one hand

I held you in my arms until God came

(Key change)

And took you away.

Chorus:

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What are we gonna do

When you are in heaven.

(Singer 2)

You are up there.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were around

(Singer 2)

We wish you were here today.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were in love

(Singer 2)

We knew we loved you.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you had no will

(Singer 2)

It's already too late

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What are we gonna do

When you are in heaven

(Singer 2)

We can't believe you are gone.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were around

(Singer 2)

We wish we were together with you.

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you were in love

(Singer 2)

We pray for you every day and every night

(6 Backing Singers and Gospel Choir)

What were we gonna do

When you had no will

(Singer 2)

We know we had to say goodbye.

(Female 1)

You walked on to the scene

When you were five years old

Singing a simple old song

There's nothing else your father can do

He's blessed with your talent and made you a star.

You Make Me Feel Better

Copyright © Lyrics by Lwazi Nkiwane 2006

Spoken ad-lib:

(Male)

There's something you need to say

Before you go

Just come to me

And I'll give you one last goodbye kiss

You close the door behind you

And you went away

I remember on the day when we met

When you were trying to help some pals

I went over there and I introduced myself to you

Do you remember my name?

(Male Vocal Ad-libs)

Verse 1:

(Male)

It was just like a dream

When you went away

I needed to know where you were

Sometimes you were so late

Coming in from the rain

You'd check your calls from everyone you could trust

The night is ours

And we were supposed to make love

It doesn't take much movement

It's a matter of fact.

Chorus:

(Male and Female)

You make me feel better

I feel it so deep inside

You make me lose control

I don't want to lose that feeling

(Male)

I don't wanna lose you now.

(Male Vocal Ad-libs)

Verse 2:

(Female)

There's something in my eyes I cannot see

It's so hard to explain

I cannot walk and I cannot hide

I have to take it so easy

Until I get much better

It helps me to look and see clearly

Before you go

I have something important to say to you

You need to know you are safe with me

And you better stop all your troubles when I asked you to.

Chorus with vocal ad-libs:

(Male and Female)

You make me feel better

I feel it so deep inside

You make me lose control

I don't want to lose that feeling

(Male and Female)

You make me feel better

I feel so much pain in you.

(Female)

So much pain in you.

(Male and Female)

You make feel so natural.

(Female)

I'm not the one to blame the fool.

Bridge with vocal ad-libs:

(Male)

When my heart calls out loud

And I know you are here baby.

You wrap around my soul

And I'll wrap around yours at the same time.

(Male and Female)

We can't lose some kind of ecstasy.

(Harmonica solo)

Chorus with vocal ad-libs - Repeat

Spoken ad-lib with harmonica solo:

(Female)

You know the time keeps on changing

From strength to strength

I keep my irons in the fire day by day and night by night

I felt so lonely without you

'Cause you were no longer here

But as for tonight it's going to be quite special

(Male)

Do you remember why it's so special?

(Female)

Well I can tell you 'cause it was so many years ago

When my momma taught me to sing

But I've recently found out that my voice is similar to Sapphire's

She's my idol and she keeps the same thing as I do

I know that I love her and she will always love me.

(Harmonica solo 'till fade)
