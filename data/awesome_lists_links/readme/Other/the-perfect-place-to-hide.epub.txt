1. INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING- IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK- OUTSKIRTS OF LEEDS. DAY.

During the credits, we move into an office building, and up to the first floor. A door reads: 'Robert Eastern, Financial Adviser'.

We Cut To- a man sat at an old- ROBERT EASTERN; a tall and handsome man.

There is a laptop on the desk, and papers etc. He looks into the monitor and smokes...

There is a knock at the door.

Robert sighs, and stands- and walks to the door, and opens it. A man stands there, PAUL, he is in his early twenties.

ROBERT: Paul?

The man nods.

ROBERT: Come in. (Regarding himself) Robert.

They shake hands.

Paul follows Robert in, and they walk over to the desk.

ROBERT: Have a seat.

PAUL: Thanks.

They sit down, and Robert reaches for his cigarette, lying in the ashtray.

ROBERT: Cigarette?

PAUL: No thanks.

ROBERT: Right, no one smokes any more.

Robert looks at him for a moment.

ROBERT: But I don't care, I've been smoking since I was fifteen.

There's a pause.

ROBERT: So what can I do for you?

PAUL: You got my email?

ROBERT: Of course, we arranged this meeting didn't we? (Beat) But you've got to go through it, in detail.

Paul smiles awkwardly.

ROBERT: There's no need to be nervous.

PAUL: I'm not. (Beat) You never told me what to expect, that's all.

ROBERT: Look, you're here because you need help, advice. All you kids are the same- no disrespect intended.

PAUL: How old are you?

ROBERT: Thirty- eight.

PAUL: That's not old.

ROBERT: That's not the point.

PAUL: Well, can you tell me a bit about yourself... And what you do?

ROBERT (Leaning back in his chair): My history is in finance, as you're probably aware of, but I gave that up a couple of years ago, to do something else.

PAUL: Why?

Robert looks at him carefully.

ROBERT: I wanted a break, and then to start up on my own. (Robert smokes) But do something a bit different. I'd spent enough time in that world, and made enough money.

Pause, Robert smiles.

ROBERT: I'm well travelled. And I have a degree in Philosophy.

PAUL: Where did you do that?

ROBERT: York. (Beat) I wanted to do something more worthwhile with my time- for my soul. (Beat) Away from the rat- race.

Pause.

ROBERT: But I know how difficult it can be to change your life- so I thought, maybe I can help people with that.

PAUL: So you can help me?

ROBERT: I can help you to come to a decision. On anything. I can help you to see all the sides of it. I'm a problem solver. A life coach- if you like- specializing in difficult decisions. But I'm not a therapist. I will listen to you- but people who come to me, have to be serious about something- and be in two minds. A fifty/ fifty kind of thing. (Beat) I will give you an answer- but whether you decide to take it or not, is up to you. I can't be held responsible, and there's no legal contract. It's all between you, and me. On the outside door it says: Robert Eastern, Financial Adviser, and that's just what I am- to the outside world. And for tax purposes. I don't mean to be clandestine, but that's just how it is.

PAUL: How do you find your clients?

ROBERT (Smiling): Word gets around.

Paul nods.

ROBERT: I don't charge by time- I charge by case. Tell me about your situation, and I'll give you a fee, and then we'll meet again.

PAUL: The fee?

ROBERT: Negotiable- depending on your financial circumstances.

PAUL: But this is free today?

ROBERT: Of course.

PAUL: How long will it take?

ROBERT: Well that depends. Usually one or two sessions. If you want to show me parts of your life, fine. I only charge expenses for anything over-night, or out of town. (Beat) Ok?

PAUL: I think so.

ROBERT: So if you like, we can go through it now- or you can come back another day.

PAUL: No, now's better.

ROBERT: Good. Coffee?

PAUL: Do you have tea?

ROBERT: Sure, come on through to the kitchen.

CUT TO-

2. INT. KITCHEN. DAY.

Robert and Paul walk into a small kitchen, at the end of Roberts' office. Robert makes the drinks, and Paul stands nearby.

ROBERT: So what do you do for a living?

PAUL: I'm a school teacher.

Robert nods, continuing with the drinks. When finished, he passes a mug to Paul, and they exit.

CUT BACK TO-

3. INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING- IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK- OUTSKIRTS OF LEEDS. DAY.

Returning to the office, they sit back down at the desk. Paul sits upright, and is fidgety in his chair. Robert slouches.

ROBERT: Is it ok if I record?

PAUL: That's fine.

ROBERT: For my own use, of course. (Beat) I'll send you a transcript, along with the fee.

PAUL: And then you'll erase it?

ROBERT: Go over it, yes.

Robert presses record on a Dictaphone on his desk.

ROBERT: When you're ready...

PAUL: Well, my girlfriend's pregnant. (Beat) She's also a teacher at the school.

ROBERT: Is it a serious relationship?

PAUL: I guess.

ROBERT: How long have you been together?

PAUL: A couple of years.

ROBERT: But you're not married. (Beat, Paul shakes his head) Well, that certainly makes things easier.

PAUL (Urgently): Does it? But it's like we're married.

ROBERT: But you're not.

Paul stares at him, and Robert leans forward slightly.

ROBERT: Try and keep things nice and simple.

Pause.

PAUL: We live together, and work together, and have the same friends...

Robert nods.

PAUL: Are you in a relationship?

ROBERT: No. But listen- couples, relationships, marriage- it's all the same to me. And it's still about individuals.

PAUL: I just want you to understand.

ROBERT: I understand. You feel trapped.

Paul leans forward, and puts his head in his hands.

ROBERT: How old are you?

PAUL: Twenty-five.

ROBERT: Sounds about right.

PAUL: What do you mean?

ROBERT: An early mid-life crisis. (Beat) And her?

PAUL: Susan. A year older.

ROBERT: Her family?

PAUL: Supportive, middle-class... Boring.

ROBERT: Get along?

PAUL: Why?

ROBERT: I'm just wondering where the pressure's coming from.

Pause.

ROBERT: Do you see other women?

Longer pause.

PAUL: A girl at the school.

Robert raises his eyebrows.

ROBERT: How old?

PAUL: Sixteen. But she doesn't seem it. (Beat) You won't say anything?

ROBERT: I'll make a deal with you- be honest with me- and tell me the truth, and I won't say a word.

PAUL: She's fifteen. Almost sixteen.

Robert sighs.

ROBERT: Do you like young girls?

PAUL: This isn't about her.

ROBERT: I'm looking for a pattern- and it seems at first to me- that you're afraid of getting older, and more responsible.

PAUL (Strongly): She came to me.

ROBERT: The young girl.

PAUL: Jamie.

ROBERT: How long have you managed to keep it quiet?

PAUL: A couple of months.

Pause.

ROBERT: How far along is Susan?

PAUL: Three months, I think.

ROBERT: And what have you discussed about it?

PAUL: She's happy, we're happy.

ROBERT: And your family know?

PAUL: Yes.

ROBERT: And colleagues?

PAUL: Yes. (Beat) It just happened- it was a mistake. I've never been very good with women... When it happened with Jamie, I was more surprised than anything else. Flattered.

Robert looks unmoved.

ROBERT: Otherwise your relationship with Susan is ok?

PAUL: Yes.

ROBERT: Fall out much?

PAUL: Not really.

ROBERT: And your parents?

PAUL: It's only my mum now- and I try to keep her at arms length.

ROBERT: Do much on your own... Have interests... Hobbies?

PAUL: No, not really. (Beat) She didn't even say she wanted one... I mean, I think she'd always planned to.

ROBERT: It just happened.

PAUL: It's all my fault- I should have been more careful.

ROBERT: So you're angry, and confused.

Paul nods.

PAUL: How can you tell...

ROBERT: And what do you want to do?

PAUL: Run away.

Pause.

PAUL: My life and job...

FADE- INTO THE NEXT MEETING.

ROBERT: So, you have a choice of two- stay or leave. (Beat) It's probably too late for a termination.

PAUL: Out of the question.

ROBERT: So let's take the smaller of the two first. Having a baby doesn't have to be the whole world- especially these days.

PAUL: You don't know Susan.

Robert smiles wryly.

ROBERT: You can still have your independence- well, what you have anyway- and be assertive about it. (Beat) Or you can up and leave- start again. With everything. But you'll never be able to change yourself. Not by much, anyway. And you won't be able to forget. (Beat) They are both big things- huge things- but the second is the more profound. And difficult. And daring.

PAUL: Thanks. And you'll help me?

ROBERT: Yes.

PAUL: I've thought about counselling.

ROBERT: That's good- but it can be round and round, without action. (Beat) And with Jamie?

PAUL: That's over.

ROBERT: You're sure?

PAUL (Nodding): She was a fling. But I worry she'll tell someone...

ROBERT: Do you?

PAUL: She's been getting hysterical lately- wanting to see me alone. If she tells her friends, it's all over.

ROBERT: What?

PAUL: My life.

Pause.

ROBERT: If you were to run away- where would you go?

PAUL: Abroad, to teach. Somewhere in the sun. America maybe.

ROBERT: Think you could leave it all behind?

PAUL (Sadly): I don't know.

ROBERT (Writing something down.): On a percentage basis- how are you feeling, right now?

PAUL: Erm... sixty to go. Forty to stay?

ROBERT: And you have the money?

PAUL: I don't really need that much money- only at first.

ROBERT: It seems then, that I'll have to put some weight on Susan's side. (Beat) Tell me about her.

PAUL (Sighing): Well, we first got to know each other, at after work drinks. We were both new there- the start of a new school year... New to the area. (Beat) I'd just moved out of sharing with Uni friends- so I was out on my own for the first time. In my own flat, I was lonely- she was the same. We started to see more of each other, especially at weekends. (Beat) I didn't really like her at the start, she was very prim and proper- and a bit dull. And so narrow minded, when it came to the arts and culture.

ROBERT: But you were attracted to her.

Paul smiles and nods.

PAUL: I wanted to go to modern art exhibitions, and music festivals- and she didn't really like seeing bands live. In the beginning it wasn't a problem though. I went to Glastonbury with my mates- and she spent time with hers, or her family. It's funny how time compresses- looking back.

ROBERT: What do you teach?

PAUL: Humanities.

ROBERT: And her?

PAUL: Science. Maths.

Robert smiles now, and there's a pause.

PAUL: Yeah, I know. (Beat) Apples and oranges.

Pause.

PAUL: And now she's pregnant.

ROBERT: And that's a big deal.

PAUL: We both like children- obviously, but I don't really want one.

ROBERT: Why not?

PAUL: I don't know. It's just how I feel.

ROBERT: Do you like yourself?

PAUL: What kind of a question is that?

ROBERT: A direct one.

PAUL: Some of the time- but who really likes themselves? The world's too competitive these days. (Beat) Ok I'm selfish, and I don't want children- it's as simple as that.

Pause.

ROBERT: Do you love her?

Another pause.

PAUL: I don't know. Impossible to say.

ROBERT: Well then, what do you like about her?

PAUL: Her affection, and softness- when she's being like that. She's clever, and good to talk to.

ROBERT: Attractive?

PAUL: Yes, you could say that.

ROBERT: The envy of other men?

PAUL: I don't know. Maybe.

ROBERT: What was she like, before you met?

PAUL: The same I think. Small town, to University.

ROBERT: Not wild at all, rebellious?

PAUL: Not even a tattoo. (Beat) Why?

ROBERT: Just trying to get a sense of her character. (Beat) And you've travelled?

PAUL: India, S E Asia. The usual. America.

ROBERT: So you're used to moving around?

Paul nods.

ROBERT: Have you always moved up?

PAUL: How do you mean?

ROBERT: Ever failed at anything important?

PAUL: Of course. (Beat) Jobs, girlfriends.

ROBERT: Career. Education?

PAUL: No.

Pause.

ROBERT: Anything else keep you here?

PAUL: No, I can't stand the place. Selby is insignificant.

Robert leans back.

ROBERT: Well... it's like I said. It's a question and answer, in two parts- and a common one. Stay- or leave.

PAUL: Yeah.

ROBERT: And it's really a question about how strongly you feel about Susan. And what you're truly capable of... Say, do you really just like the idea of being able to up and leave her? (Beat) You haven't before, have you?

PAUL: No, not really.

ROBERT: How long have you been away from her before?

PAUL: A few days. A weekend.

ROBERT: But you kept in touch, right?

PAUL (Sighing): The other day I didn't go to work... I went to the seaside by myself. Scarborough.

Robert smiles slightly.

PAUL: I just carried on driving. I've never done that before... I'm not sure what I'm capable of...

ROBERT: Did you tell her?

PAUL: No, and she never asked. I sometimes think she knows... something's wrong. But she has enough on her plate. We're moving in together, on top of everything else.

ROBERT: So ultimately, your lives are very much in sync?

PAUL (Sadly): Yes, I suppose so.

Pause.

ROBERT: And the most important thing- what is really best for you. Ultimately we're all individuals- and we act for ourselves, first. Having children complicates this, but we always- continue to- see the world from our own eyes.

PAUL: So what do I do?

ROBERT: Then there's the question of morality- could you live with yourself? (Beat) And your attraction to young girls- even though you're still relatively young yourself is... Difficult; and complex. It's against the law for one thing. And is it healthy? Are you rebellious yourself- and do you want to continue to be- or do you want to grow up, and live up to the status, and responsibilities of your job?

PAUL: I don't know.

ROBERT: And the moving around you've done, may have unsettled you- for this time of your life. (Beat) Now you can accept this, or try and change it- thereby becoming the best version of yourself. (Beat) Maybe you and Susan are too incompatible, and should have some time apart? That would probably be my advice- the middle ground. (Beat) Or you could drastically disappear for good, and start again. Wipe your past- and put yourself first. Or accept this fate for yourself. Either way is incredibly hard- and in the future you may yearn for the child you've left behind, and have to re-connect with the past... Or there may be a knock on your door. (Beat) Who knows?

PAUL: But you'll help me?

ROBERT: Yes.

Paul stands, and then so does Robert. They shake hands, and then walk to the door.

PAUL: So you'll be in touch.

ROBERT: I will.

PAUL: Thanks.

Robert pats him on the shoulder, and he exits. Robert walks back to the desk, stops the recorder, and sits back down. He lights another cigarette, and leans back, thinking.

Close Up on him, and FADE.

4. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. EVENING.

Robert enters his flat- which comprises of a living room, with a modern kitchen at the side. The decor is minimal but expensive looking and chic- with few personal items. There's a sofa and coffee table; and a bedroom and bathroom at the far side.

He looks tired, and puts his shoulder bag down near the sofa. He takes off his suit jacket, and goes over to the kitchen and prepares a coffee- leaning and thinking. When the coffee's made, he takes it over to the sofa- putting the coffee cup down, before sinking into it.

Close Up: He closes his eyes, drifting off to sleep.

There's a knock at the door, and Robert is awoken. He moves uneasily, up onto his feet. He has a drink of the coffee, before idling over to the door. Opening it, there is a very attractive girl standing there.

Close On: She is tall, young and pretty. He invites her in. There is a brief pause before he leads her over to, and into the bedroom.

CUT TO-

5. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- EARLY EVENING.

Robert and the girl kiss upon entering the bedroom- and undressing each other, they fall onto the bed.

FADE

Later now- the girl gets dressed- and we follow her as she goes through to the living room (Cutting To the Main Flat), and exits, without looking back.

Back on Robert, he lies very still.

FADE

Robert gets up, and goes through to the adjoining bathroom.

6. INT. BATHROOM- OFF BEDROOM, IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

Close On: He has a shower, enjoying it- still looking tired.

7. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

He exits the bathroom in a robe, and goes to a closet in the bedroom- getting out some casual clothes (T-Shirt and loose trousers). Putting them on, he then goes through to the main flat and kitchen.

8. INT. LIVING ROOM IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

Robert makes himself some food- a light meal using the microwave. He puts some music on- and it's soulful and relaxing. He collects the food- and getting a glass of water, he sits down on the sofa- eating the food on his lap. The phone rings- he scowls and ignores it. He turns on the TV- to the news- with the volume down. When he's finished eating, he returns to the kitchen- putting the dirty dishes in a dishwasher. He makes another coffee, and lights a cigarette, leaning again on the counter. The phone rings again, and this time he picks it up. Pause.

ROBERT (Strongly): No. I said a fortnight, didn't I? You'll just have to wait.

Another Pause.

ROBERT: Well, that's up to you. (Beat) Goodbye.

Robert puts the phone down. He sighs, and drinks his coffee, smoking in between.

ROBERT: Fucking people today. Learn some patience.

The phone rings again.

ROBERT (Sharply): What?

HAZEL, a lady in her thirties, answers. She is attractive, and well spoken. She is at home, and we cut between her and Robert.

HAZEL: Robert?

ROBERT (Softening): Oh, it's you.

HAZEL: Are you ok?

ROBERT: Yes, everything's fine. Just tired.

HAZEL: Are you sure?

ROBERT: Yep.

HAZEL: Don't feel down.

ROBERT: I'm not. (Beat) Heavy day that's all.

HAZEL: In what way?

ROBERT: Just heavy... Psychologically. No new leads... But I'll drop by tomorrow... Or the next day.

HAZEL: Ok, but ring me first. (Beat) Get some rest.

ROBERT: I will. (Beat) How are the girls?

HAZEL: They're fine.

ROBERT: Good. Give them my love... Well, I'll say goodnight then.

HAZEL: Goodnight.

ROBERT: Bye.

Robert puts the phone down, and tips his coffee down the sink. He pours himself a whiskey, and knocks it back. He walks back to the bedroom.

9. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

Robert puts the light on, and climbs into bed.

Close Up on his face. He lies on his back, thinking.

FADE

10. EXT. THE GARDEN OF A SUBURBAN HOUSE- DAY.

It's a sunny day- a few months earlier- and Robert is sitting side by side with HAZEL; but at first we don't see her. They lie back on garden chairs, drinking iced tea. Two young girls- KATIE and BECKY, play nearby.

ROBERT: It's nice here. I could take to this.

HAZEL: Sitting outside?

ROBERT (Smiling): The house. The garden.

HAZEL: Being here with us?

ROBERT: Yeah, that's nice as well.

HAZEL (Softly): I like it too.

Pause.

ROBERT: But... There's work to get on with.

HAZEL (Slightly down): I don't know what's going on. (Beat) You don't tell me anything.

ROBERT: It's best that you don't know really... For the time being.

Hazel nods.

HAZEL: How long will it take?

ROBERT: I don't know. (Beat) Not long I hope. Don't worry. I need to get set up again... I've been looking at places in Leeds.

HAZEL: At least it's not far.

ROBERT: It can't be far. (Beat) And the hard truth is, we need some money coming in...

HAZEL: We are very grateful you know. Without you...

ROBERT: It's nothing. You're my family.

HAZEL (Smiling): It's good to hear you say that.

She moves closer to him. He looks away.

Close On- Away from her. He whispers something.

FADE OUT.

11. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- NIGHT.

Close On Robert again. He turns to the side- still sleeping and breathing heavily- and holding onto the sheets tightly.

FADE OUT.

12. INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING- IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK- OUTSKIRTS OF LEEDS. EARLY MORNING.

Robert is back at his desk, drinking coffee and smoking. There's a knock at the door. He goes over to it- tiredly.

The door is opened to reveal a very attractive blonde girl- CASSANDRA.

ROBERT: Hi.

CASSANDRA: Hi, I'm Cassandra- call me Cassy. May I have a word with you?

ROBERT: Sure, come in.

They go over to the desk.

ROBERT: Have a seat.

CASSANDRA: Thanks.

She sits down.

ROBERT: So what can I do for you- it's usually by appointment only.

CASSANDRA: I'm sorry. See I have a problem, I hope you can help me with.

ROBERT: That's what people come to me for.

CASSANDRA: That's what I've heard.

Robert smiles.

CASSANDRA: I know what you do here.

ROBERT: I don't know whether to feel flattered. (Beat) But I don't know anything about you, so it's hardly fair, now is it?

CASSANDRA: So how well do you get to know your clients, before you meet them?

ROBERT: As well as I can.

CASSANDRA: Are you always so meticulous?

ROBERT: I like to know who I'm dealing with.

CASSANDRA: How long will that take?

ROBERT: Not long. A background check- some details about you. See, I tend to get clients from certain areas of society...

CASSANDRA (Suddenly): Mr Malone.

This gets his attention.

CASSANDRA: I'm his wife. Cassandra Alex Malone. Formerly Peterson.

Pause. He smokes, looking at her carefully. He then picks up a pen, and moves a sheet of paper over.

ROBERT: Right. (Beat) Age?

CASSANDRA: Twenty- Four.

ROBERT: Address?

CASSANDRA: Mornington Heights, Oakdale, Harrogate.

ROBERT: Phone number?

CASSANDRA: Landline?

ROBERT: It's up to you.

CASSANDRA: Take them both: 01423 653170. 07765428590.

ROBERT: Occupation?

CASSANDRA: I feel like I'm applying for a loan.

Robert looks at her for a beat.

CASSANDRA (Wryly): Entrepreneur.

He breaks, and smokes again.

ROBERT: So, I'll get back to you, and we'll make another appointment.

CASSANDRA (Impatiently): I need to get a move on with things.

ROBERT: Well then, I'll tell you what- give me the brief today, and I'll see what I can do.

CASSANDRA: Yes, fine. Are you always so laid back?

ROBERT: Why is time such an issue?

CASSANDRA: Isn't it always?

ROBERT: Well no, actually. My clients have usually wasted so much time anyway. They want me to give them quick answers, but they'll usually faff about some more on their own.

CASSANDRA: Well I don't- faff about. (Beat) And I need to make a decision now... Today. This morning.

ROBERT (Leaning back): This hour? (Beat) Sorry, it doesn't work that way. This isn't Citizens advice.

CASSANDRA: I'll email you some references.

ROBERT: Don't be curt.

CASSANDRA: Are you mocking me?

ROBERT: No.

CASSANDRA: So you're normally this annoying.

ROBERT (Leaning forward): Now look- if you're going to talk to me like that, we have no further business.

CASSANDRA (Rubbing her temples): I'm sorry. I'm under a lot of pressure. (Beat) I'm wealthy. I can pay you well.

Cassandra leans forward.

CASSANDRA: May I have a cigarette?

Robert gives her one, and lights it for her. They stare at each other for a minute.

Robert leans back again.

ROBERT: I'll tell you what I'll do. If I like what I hear today- we can meet again tomorrow. (Dryly) If that's convenient.

CASSANDRA (Plainly): Fine.

ROBERT: Coffee?

CASSANDRA: Ok.

ROBERT: White, sugar?

CASSANDRA: Black, no sugar.

Robert smiles.

ROBERT: I'll be right back.

The camera stays on Cassandra, as Robert gets up and goes to the kitchen. He returns with a cup- putting it on the table in front of her.

CASSANDRA: Thanks.

Robert sits back down.

CASSANDRA: Do you live on your own?

ROBERT: Excuse me?

CASSANDRA: I was just looking around... Not very clean.

ROBERT: It isn't? (Beat, Smiling) Maybe I'll get a cleaner then.

She looks at him carefully.

CASSANDRA: So how good are you with relationships?

ROBERT: Me? I like my independence.

CASSANDRA: So I can see. (Beat) Ever been married?

ROBERT: No.

CASSANDRA: Engaged?

ROBERT: Not even close.

CASSANDRA: So how can you help me? If you're going to help me with my problem- I want to know that you can relate to my circumstances.

ROBERT: In what way?

CASSANDRA: Violence.

ROBERT: No.

CASSANDRA: Ever hit a woman?

ROBERT (His mood darkens): Now listen...

CASSANDRA: Wanted to? (Beat) Ever _been_ hit by a women?

ROBERT (Staring at her): If you're trying to get a rise out of me- it's working.

CASSANDRA: Are you a fighter, with other men? Or do you run away...

Robert smiles, sits back, and sighs.

ROBERT: I stand my ground.

Pause, he studies her.

ROBERT: So what you're trying to tell me is, your husband beats you up?

CASSANDRA: Yes.

ROBERT: So what do you want from me? Divorce him.

CASSANDRA: No, I want him killed.

Robert looks at her deeply, with a slight smile.

ROBERT: That's not really what I do.

CASSANDRA: That's not what I want.

ROBERT: So what is it you want?

CASSANDRA: Should I?

Robert grunts with laughter.

ROBERT: You're asking me that?

CASSANDRA: This is serious. Why aren't you taking me seriously?

ROBERT: How do you know that you can trust me?

CASSANDRA: I'm a good judge of people. And you're not like that.

Robert smiles slightly, confused.

CASSANDRA: And looking around, this place hardly looks legit.

ROBERT: I'm not sure I like your manner.

CASSANDRA (Copying his smile/ Slightly flirty): You could live with it, I'm sure.

Pause, Robert studies her again.

CASSANDRA: I would pay you handsomely, of course. (Beat) Would you like to think about it?

ROBERT (Sighing): I take it there's a lot to go through.

CASSANDRA: No, not really.

Robert looks stern. Cassandra likes this.

CASSANDRA: Shall we say, same time tomorrow then?

Robert nods weakly.

Cassandra stands up.

CASSANDRA (Slyly): And no recording devices.

She turns to leave, and Robert goes with her to the door. She turns back to him

CASSANDRA: I'm serious, Robert.

ROBERT: I can see you are.

Cassandra exits, and there's a close up on Robert.

ROBERT: Cassandra Alex Malone.

He smiles- differently than anywhere else in the scene- like he's got a lot on his mind, and there's a FADE OUT.

FADE IN. We return; with Robert stood in the same position- but this time starting from Cassandra's point of view.

ROBERT (Smiling): Come in...

He holds the door open for her, and she enters.

CASSANDRA: Thanks.

They walk over to the desk, and sit down, like before.

CASSANDRA: So... Do I check out?

Pause. Robert thinks.

ROBERT: I don't know- I couldn't find any information on you.

CASSANDRA: Oh, I have lived, I assure you.

Robert smiles thinly.

ROBERT: So I'd be taking a chance.

CASSANDRA: Who doesn't?

He lights a cigarette.

ROBERT: Only about your education- St Andrews. No criminal convictions, solid family background. (Beat) You worked in the Senior Civil Service after you graduated- which is presumably how you came to meet Mr Malone.

CASSANDRA: No, I first met John as an Intern.

ROBERT: And you married him in Scotland four years ago. (Beat) I know him, everyone does- he's a Tory MP.

Pause.

ROBERT: But, there's little in the press about your marriage.

CASSANDRA: That was John's idea- to keep things private.

ROBERT: And your age is mentioned as twenty- eight.

CASSANDRA: Again. For discretion.

ROBERT: I'm just surprised how he did it.

CASSANDRA: He's a very capable man.

ROBERT: I don't doubt it, but you told me you were twenty- four.

CASSANDRA: I'm trying to be myself again.

Robert looks at her curiously.

ROBERT: And your family?

CASSANDRA: They don't know anything.

ROBERT: How could you deceive them?

CASSANDRA: Look, they're happy- that's more than enough.

Pause.

ROBERT: So at first, you worked for Mr Malone?

CASSANDRA: Yes, while I was still at University.

ROBERT (Sitting back): I see.

CASSANDRA: It wasn't like that. I was a politics student.

ROBERT: But you didn't go and work for him straight away, after University?

CASSANDRA: No, but we kept in touch- and he didn't forget me- so he asked me to be his assistant. He was still young- ish; in his late thirties.

ROBERT: So why the cover up?

CASSANDRA (Sighing): It was a little thing.

ROBERT: Change anything else?

CASSANDRA (Sternly): No.

Pause.

ROBERT: Well, usually I'm not so bothered when there's not much to find on a client- it means they're normal. But with you, I'm not so sure. And if something doesn't sit right...

CASSANDRA (Curiously/ Slightly flirty): Do you always trust your instincts?

ROBERT: It's how most decisions are made- a gut feeling.

CASSANDRA (Bored): And...

ROBERT: I'll take the case.

CASSANDRA (Mock relieved): Good.

ROBERT: For fifteen-thousand.

CASSANDRA: Fine.

ROBERT: On one condition- it's a day's case, here today- and then it's over. I'll give you my thoughts right away, and I never want to see you again.

CASSANDRA (Dryly): I won't take it personally.

ROBERT (Sarcastically): And be truthful with me. It only helps you. (Beat) Here are my account details, I'll expect payment right away.

Robert gives her a sheet of paper, off his desk.

ROBERT: A drink?

Robert gets up. Cassandra smirks.

CASSANDRA: You like formalities, don't you?

ROBERT: I find it loosens people up. (Beat) Coffee?

CASSANDRA: Please.

Robert exits, and we stay on Cassandra again. She lights a cigarette- one of her own this time.

Robert returns with the drinks, and sits back down. He also lights a cigarette. She sips her coffee.

ROBERT: So begin.

CASSANDRA: My husband's a bad man.

ROBERT: So I've gathered. (Beat) So divorce him. You're young, it's only a marriage. Start again.

CASSANDRA: I don't want to. It's my marriage.

ROBERT (Shaking his head): Why did you get married in the first place? Love? Financial security?

Cassandra scoffs.

CASSANDRA: He should pay in some way- it's only right.

ROBERT (Sighing): So he hurts you... Physically and emotionally.

CASSANDRA: Ever since we've been married.

ROBERT: Anything you can show me- Bruises? Broken skin?

Cassandra rolls up the sleeves on her arms one by one, and they're bruised.

ROBERT: So you fight him off?

CASSANDRA: I do my best. (Beat) We haven't made love in months.

ROBERT: So you've left him. Moved out?

CASSANDRA: No.

ROBERT: I don't understand. How can you stay?

CASSANDRA: I have my reasons.

Robert sighs again.

ROBERT: Do you still love him?

CASSANDRA: No.

ROBERT: And you want to kill him.

CASSANDRA: Passionately.

He stares at her.

ROBERT: I should go to the police.

CASSANDRA: How do you know I'm serious?

ROBERT: Well- that's what I have to determine.

CASSANDRA: We've got a deal you'd hear me out... And you seem like a man of your word. (Beat) I didn't think you liked the police.

ROBERT: Why?

CASSANDRA: Because you're so private. That's why I know I can trust you.

ROBERT: You should never trust anyone. (Beat) You're a confident judge of character, for someone who's made such a big mistake.

CASSANDRA: I got carried away by my feelings... I'm not the first girl to have done that.

Pause, Robert takes a deep breath- breathing out heavily.

ROBERT: So tell me about John. (Beat) He got into government soon after you were married?

CASSANDRA: Yes, and it killed our relationship.

ROBERT: And now he's a backbencher... After the scandal.

Cassandra nods.

CASSANDRA: My husband has a ferocious appetite for sex. He can't help himself.

ROBERT: Call girls.

CASSANDRA: Several at one time. Orgies. And he had them everywhere.

ROBERT: Yes, it was in all the papers.

CASSANDRA: Even in Westminster- if it was to be believed. (Beat) It was all very embarrassing.

Robert nods.

CASSANDRA: And he hit them...

ROBERT: I get the picture.

CASSANDRA: Do you? So you know all about it.

ROBERT: I know politicians.

CASSANDRA: He was eventually caught out. He didn't know who his friends were any more.

ROBERT: A problem with power.

CASSANDRA: He was stupid. Indiscreet. And these days with modern technology- it only takes a small camera... It was inevitable.

ROBERT: And all part of the thrill.

CASSANDRA: Ever live dangerously?

ROBERT (Smiling slightly): It always seems to be Tory politicians. (Beat) Were you involved?

CASSANDRA: No. But when the scandal broke- only a few months ago- his career was over, and I became irrelevant, because I didn't understand. And then he became more unstable and violent.

ROBERT: And he'd hurt you before?

CASSANDRA: Of course, it's in his nature.

ROBERT: And now?

CASSANDRA (Sighing): He comes to see me, when he wants to have sex. And we fight. We barely see each other- other than that, and usually in the evening.

ROBERT: And it's only you and him in the house?

CASSANDRA (Nodding): I may be all he has. He's holding on.

ROBERT: To what?

CASSANDRA: His mind. His finances. (Beat) That's why I have to do something now.

ROBERT: I still don't understand why you don't leave?

CASSANDRA (Now annoyed): You don't get it do you? He won't let me. He has a hold over me. A power.

ROBERT: But you can come here?

CASSANDRA: For a couple of hours. I know his routine. But I suspect he's having me followed.

Robert smiles slightly.

CASSANDRA: Don't believe me. Come and see.

ROBERT: No, I don't think that'll be necessary.

Pause.

ROBERT: So your motive, is your freedom.

CASSANDRA: You say that like a police officer.

Robert scoffs.

CASSANDRA: I want him to die, but I want a life. I've paid enough in advance. He's had a good forty-three years...

ROBERT: So what do you need me for? It seems like you've already made up your mind.

Pause.

CASSANDRA (Low/ Conspiratorial- and we're Close On her):

Someone I know can get some pills- that induce a heart attack- and then all trace of it disappears. Kind of like a poisonous Rohypnol.

Robert gives her a strong look, to see if she's serious.

CASSANDRA (Enthusiastically): I'd replace one of his other pills- we'd probably have sex, and then he'd die. I'd have some bruises- and an alibi, and my wish.

ROBERT: You watch too much TV. It sounds like a likely story.

CASSANDRA: No, it's legit.

ROBERT: Legit? (Beat) And then you'll look forward to a nice settlement.

CASSANDRA: It's only what I deserve.

Robert raises his eyebrows.

ROBERT: And this "contact" of yours.

CASSANDRA: An old friend.

He scoffs.

ROBERT: Why do you believe them? Has it worked before?

CASSANDRA: So he says.

ROBERT: Well I've never heard of anything like that.

CASSANDRA: Why would you? But you don't know everything.

Pause- Robert sits back, and looks at her.

ROBERT: I've heard some ways of changing a life before, but this is one of the more elaborate.

CASSANDRA: Inventive. Admit it. (Beat) And I'm desperate, I have to do it.

ROBERT: Uh- huh.

CASSANDRA (Smiling- Reassuringly): It would be a clean death. He'd just... Die. Disappear. Isn't that your specialty? (This comment surprises him) He'd even keep his dignity. It's more than a lot of people have.

ROBERT: So if it was in any way violent, or messy- you couldn't do it?

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Death is always messy... But I've come across this opportunity, so why shouldn't I take it?

ROBERT (Raising his eyebrows again): You would still be an executioner.

CASSANDRA (Quickly) He won't suffer. (Beat) He's made enough other people suffer.

ROBERT: That's what you keep saying...

CASSANDRA: You don't want to know any more.

Robert looks at her- and she moves closer to him- lighting another cigarette.

CASSANDRA: What are you looking at me like that for?

ROBERT: I'm just wondering, if you're the vengeful type.

CASSANDRA: Well I'm not.

ROBERT: No, you're like ice- that's what worries me.

CASSANDRA: I just want my life to change. And this is the best way, for everyone.

Robert scoffs.

ROBERT: So what if I tell you it's ok to do it. He's a violent man- that much you've told me- and I've read some things myself...

CASSANDRA (Impatiently): What does your gut instinct tell you?

Pause.

ROBERT: I've made my decision.

CASSANDRA: Care to share it with me?

ROBERT: If you have nothing else to tell me?

CASSANDRA: No, I don't think so.

ROBERT: Afterwards, what would you do?

CASSANDRA: I'm not sure yet...

ROBERT: I'd want you to leave- go abroad- get away from it all.

CASSANDRA: I could do that... When the dust has settled- and loose ends are tied up.

ROBERT: And the resulting media attention?

CASSANDRA: I'll deal with that.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: His old colleagues will be glad to see the back of him.

Robert studies her again.

CASSANDRA (Tenderly): Then I could come and see you...

ROBERT (Smiling): Don't flatter me.

CASSANDRA: I know you like female company.

ROBERT: And how do you know that?

Pause.

CASSANDRA: You seem like the kind of guy, who likes many women.

Robert laughs.

ROBERT: Yes, I do.

CASSANDRA: So then, what's wrong with me finding you attractive?

ROBERT: (Moving closer to her) Cassandra, you're a very attractive girl- but that only worries me.

CASSANDRA: You don't need to be afraid.

Robert smirks.

CASSANDRA: I'm harmless.

Robert sits back, and returns to a serious look.

ROBERT: And when were you thinking of doing, the deed?

CASSANDRA: Tomorrow night.

ROBERT: You can get the stuff that quickly?

CASSANDRA: Yes, Dillon is always available for me. (Beat) I've done enough thinking about it. I can't stand another moment with that pig. If I don't do something, I'll be taking one of the pills myself.

Robert looks at her, for signs of seriousness.

CASSANDRA: But... That will only give him, what he wants.

ROBERT: Is that what you really think?

CASSANDRA: That's what I know. (Beat) He tries to all the time... He's taking me, piece by piece.

ROBERT (Exhaling): Then do it.

CASSANDRA: Yes? You're serious?

ROBERT: You've already made up your mind anyway- and I don't think there's anything I can do to change it.

Pause.

ROBERT: You seem to be able to justify it to yourself. (Beat) It's about putting things right- which is a positive motive. But what concerns me is vengeance- revenge- and will you be satisfied?

Cassandra smiles- innocently.

CASSANDRA: Yes- one time only. And I'm never getting married again- that's for sure. (Beat) And I've told you- I don't want him to suffer.

ROBERT: Ok then.

CASSANDRA: It's nice to hear you talk.

ROBERT: That's what you pay me for.

Robert stands abruptly, and she follows him.

CASSANDRA: Well it's been great talking to you- a relief, actually. Thanks for helping me with this.

ROBERT: No problem.

They walk to the door.

CASSANDRA: I never would have been able to do it on my own.

Robert smiles, but also looks confused.

She leans over and kisses him on the cheek, and then turns around and exits.

Robert stands at the doorway- and we stay on him for a moment- as he watches her go down the stairs. He breathes in and out deeply.

13. EXT. OUTSIDE OFFICE- DAY.

Robert steps out of his office, and turns to the opened door. He peels the sign off.

14. INT. AN OFFICE BUILDING- IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK- OUTSKIRTS OF LEEDS. DAY.

Robert returns to his desk- and from a nearby closet, he takes out some empty boxes. He starts packing things away from his desk. And going into the kitchen briefly- he does the same in there, and tidies up.

FADE.

15. EXT. A COMMUNITY HALL, HARROGATE- EVENING. IT'S RAINING.

It is around four years earlier (Maybe a title comes up). People file into the building.

16. INT. A COMMUNITY HALL, HARROGATE- EVENING.

It is an election night. The hall is packed full of people, and there's a stage at the front, and a drinks table to the side. The camera pans around to CASSANDRA, who stands near to the stage- looking smart, and carrying a clipboard. There is a lot of activity, with people talking and drinking. Suddenly, there is a hush- as the camera pans around and fixes on JOHN MALONE at the entrance, with his wife MARIE. Marie is attractive, like Cassandra- but is more refined and reserved. There is then a wild applause- as Mr Malone moves into the hall.

There's a Two-Shot, as Mr Malone and Marie- move through the crowd, shaking hands, toward the stage.

JOHN MALONE: Thank you, thank you, you are very kind. Hi, how are you?

He passes Cassandra, giving her a strong/ suggestive look. She looks away. He takes to the stage with Marie- who stands to the side, in the shadows. There are regular cheers, throughout the following speech:

JOHN MALONE (Cont'd): What a momentous occasion. The Conservatives are back! The constituency of Harrogate and Knaresborough has been one of the leaders of this campaign. Over the past few months, we've shown what the New Conservative Party is all about. And tonight, we've seen the fruits of all that hard work. A landslide victory. I have always been proud of my Yorkshire roots- and tonight is the proudest moment of my career, standing here, with you (He looks at his wife briefly). Tomorrow, we'll form a new government, and begin to put our words into action. Our promise to reduce crime- improve healthcare- and the growth in our economy will be our top priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a new dawn in our democracy- and you will see the benefits on the streets. We will have our sense of community back- fear will go, and families and citizenship will return. The forgotten people. The middle classes. We will reduce immigration, and reconsider our relationship within Europe: under our terms. And with an end to the wishy washy politics of Old Labour- we will be strong. (Beat) So let's celebrate, and have a drink or two- but not too much, because there is much work to begin tomorrow (A final loud cheer, and clapping).

Mr Malone bows his head dramatically- with his hands together as if in prayer, before stepping down from the stage. He walks through the room again, shaking people's hands, and smiling. Marie and Cassandra follow. They reach the drinks table. Mr Malone talks to someone Off Camera- and we are left on Cassandra, and Marie. They look at each other uncomfortably.

MARIE: So... How long have you worked for John?

CASSANDRA: A couple of months... I've been helping out with the campaign.

Marie looks her up and down.

MARIE: You're young.

Cassandra smiles awkwardly.

MARIE: So you want a career in politics then?

Cassandra nods, petulantly.

MARIE: I don't know why, they are all liars.

Cassandra smiles- more at ease now.

Marie looks directly at her.

MARIE: Stay away from my husband.

CASSANDRA: Excuse me?

MARIE: You heard me. Go back to school.

CASSANDRA: Are you trying to tell me what to do?

MARIE: Listen little girl, he won't give you a leg up.

CASSANDRA (Looking directly at her): I don't know what you're talking about.

Marie suddenly grabs her arm. And moves closer to her- and there's a Close Up.

MARIE: You see he likes little girls- the younger the better- but he'll just use you, and throw you away...

Cassandra tries to move away...

CASSANDRA (Firmly): Let me go.

Marie screams.

CASSANDRA: You're mad.

There's a hush in the hall, as Mr Malone moves over to them.

JOHN MALONE (Grabbing his wife's arm): Everything ok?

MARIE: No. I want to go. (Strongly) Again John? I can see that look in her eyes, like all the others.

Mr Malone is annoyed and uncomfortable, and Cassandra gives her a strong look.

JOHN MALONE (Softly): Cassandra is part of my staff, you know that.

MARIE: I want to leave. Now.

JOHN MALONE: Yes, of course.

Mr Malone motions to someone off camera, and a plain looking 'security type' appears.

JOHN MALONE: David will take you home.

MARIE (Looking sullen): Yes. (Beat) I need some air...

CASSANDRA (Sarcastically): Goodbye.

Marie moves past her, and Mr Malone gives Cassandra an uneasy smile. Cassandra looks away, and Mr Malone turns back to talk to an elderly couple, as the lively atmosphere returns to the room.

FADE

17. INT. LADIES' BATHROOM, COMMUNITY HALL- LATE EVENING.

This scene has a dreamy feel to it. There are mirrors and sinks in the centre of the room- dividing it with a partition, with cubicles on both sides.

Wide Shot- Cassandra enters, and walks around- looking in all the cubicles, one is closed- before going to a sink and mirror on one side.

Close On- She looks into the mirror for a Long Beat, and then fills the basin with water. She bends down, and dabs water on her face. Wide Shot- There is a flush in the closed cubicle, and Marie opens the door and exits. She too then goes to the mirror and sink- on the opposite side to Cassandra- facing her. Close On- She washes her hands and looks in the mirror, she has been crying and mascara has run/ smudged under her eyes. She bends over and splashes water onto her eyes, before dabbing them with toilet paper.

CUT TO, Wide- Closer- Cassandra rises, and looks at herself blankly in the mirror. Marie rises, and does the same- but is on the verge of tears once again. Cassandra slowly smiles. The door opens on the other side to her, and she looks around- but she can't see anyone. She turns back. Marie can see who it is in the reflection of her mirror.

Close On- Marie sniffles one last time, Wide- before turning around and exiting through the door.

CUT TO- Close On- Cassandra. She re-applies make up from her bag, and tends to her hair etc. Wide- She then turns around confidently, and exits through the door.

FADE

18. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. EVENING.

Robert enters his flat, like before. Putting his bag down, he goes to the kitchen, and gets a glass of water. Drinking it, he sits down on the sofa. After a short while- Close On his tired face- he gets some notes out of his bag, and looks at them. He gets out the mini cassette Dictaphone from his office, and presses play- playing back some of the dialogue from Scene 1. He looks over a transcript, before putting it- along with a letter- into a large envelope, sealing it shut. It's addressed to Paul Simmons, and is marked 'confidential' in bold letters. He puts it to one side.

ROBERT: Think about that, young man. But it'll cost you.

He then lies on the sofa, and closes his eyes- Slow Fade.

His phone rings suddenly. He picks it up. It's Cassandra, and we cut between them.

Cassandra is in a dimly lit hallway.

ROBERT: Hello?

CASSANDRA (Softly): Robert, it's Cassy.

Pause.

ROBERT: I don't remember giving you my number.

CASSANDRA: Would you like to come over?

ROBERT: How do you know I'm not alone?

CASSANDRA: You wouldn't have answered.

Robert smiles.

ROBERT: It's not really...

CASSANDRA: I don't care.

Robert sits up and lights a cigarette.

ROBERT: Has anything happened?

CASSANDRA: I want you. (Beat) I don't want to be alone tonight, ok.

ROBERT: Where is he?

CASSANDRA: At a function.

ROBERT: I wouldn't want to...

CASSANDRA: He won't be back until the early hours- and he'll be sozzled.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: You said you wanted to know more...

ROBERT: Did I? (Beat) But what's it matter now?

CASSANDRA: It's important to me.

ROBERT: What is?

CASSANDRA: That you trust me. (Beat) Like me. And I still think we have things to talk about. And remember what I said earlier... I'm so worked up, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I need a distraction.

Robert sighs. He looks at his watch.

ROBERT: I could be there in about hour.

CASSANDRA (Perking up): You know where we are?

ROBERT: I think so.

CASSANDRA: Good. I'll be waiting...

Cassandra hangs up, and then Robert does the same. He pauses- finishing his cigarette. He then goes through to the Bedroom and Bathroom.

19. INT. BATHROOM- OFF BEDROOM, IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

Robert takes his clothes off, and looks at himself in the bathroom mirror briefly- at his eyes- before stepping into the shower, and putting his head and face under it. Stepping out of the shower, he puts on a bathrobe, and goes through to the bedroom.

20. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- LATE EVENING.

Robert puts on some smart/ casual clothes, before going through to the Main Flat.

21. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. LATE EVENING.

Robert picks up his phone and car keys, before opening the door, and exiting.

22. EXT/ INT. CAR DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS, AND SUBURBS. NIGHT.

Robert drives from the centre of Leeds, North, towards Harrogate. He listens to some 1950s Jazz, or Rock 'n' Roll music on a local radio station. He looks stern and serious. Robert eventually arrives at a large- detached, gated house. Pulling up, the gate opens almost straight away, and he drives up to a space near the front door. Robert gets out, looking around, before walking to the door. He rings the bell.

23. INT. HALLWAY- DETACHED HOUSE, NIGHT.

The door is opened by Cassandra, and Robert stands there expectantly.

CASSANDRA (Subdued): Come in.

She opens the door wider.

ROBERT: I hoped to get a better welcome than that.

CASSANDRA: I'm sorry. (Beat) Come through.

Robert follows Cassandra as they walk through to a lounge.

ROBERT (Looking around): Nice place...

24. INT. LOUNGE- DETACHED HOUSE, NIGHT.

The lounge is large, and is decorated with old antique furniture and drapes. It is dimly lit as Cassandra and Robert enter, and at first Robert doesn't see the large man lying on the chaise longue, on the other side of the room...

ROBERT: And who might he be?

CASSANDRA (Quickly now): He came back early... So I drugged his Scotch.

ROBERT (Angrily): You did what?

Robert moves closer to him.

CASSANDRA: I was desperate... So I used the Deprahydrine.

ROBERT: No shit. (Beat) You couldn't wait?

CASSANDRA: What difference would that have made?

ROBERT: I don't know... I thought you had a plan? (Brief pause) So what do you want from me?

CASSANDRA: I thought you could help.

Robert stares at her.

She moves closer to him.

CASSANDRA: He's been coughing and convulsing- and trying to throw up.

Robert gives her a serious, mocking look.

CASSANDRA: He won't die.

ROBERT: No..? So call your friend, the fixer.

CASSANDRA: He's not answering.

ROBERT: So ring for an ambulance.

CASSANDRA: You know I can't do that. And then he'll know I tried to kill him.

Robert laughs absurdly.

ROBERT: Why?

CASSANDRA: He just will. He's gone mad. He says I'm finished.

ROBERT (Moving closer again to him): He's quiet now.

CASSANDRA: He passed out.

ROBERT (Turning back to her): You may have to face the music. It's gone wrong...

CASSANDRA: It's not over yet.

ROBERT: Do you keep checking his pulse?

Robert looks over him.

CASSANDRA: I keep checking he's breathing.

Robert gives her another stern look.

ROBERT: How long has he been like this?

CASSANDRA: I don't know... Ten, fifteen minutes.

ROBERT: And all this happened, after you called me?

CASSANDRA: Of course.

Robert looks at her suspiciously.

ROBERT: You're not dressed, how I thought you would be.

CASSANDRA: And how did you think I'd be dressed.

ROBERT (Flatly): Sexier.

CASSANDRA: So you think I got you here under false pretences?

Pause. She goes over to him, and kisses him on the lips.

CASSANDRA: I was just about to get changed, when he came back.

ROBERT: But instead you thought you'd spike his drink.

CASSANDRA: He was drunk when he came home, and I was worked up. (A bit girly, looking for sympathy) He started shouting at me. I thought you'd understand, I thought you wanted to help me.

Suddenly, Mr Malone stirs, coughing and shaking.

ROBERT: So what did you want me to do?

CASSANDRA (Softly, Conspiratorially): Kill him.

ROBERT: What?

CASSANDRA: Help me kill him.

ROBERT: Lady, you're crazy.

CASSANDRA: You have to.

ROBERT: I what?

CASSANDRA: You're involved.

ROBERT: Excuse me?

CASSANDRA: You're all I have in this... Please.

Robert turns away- looking out of the far windows.

ROBERT: And why do you think I can help you with this? And why would I?

CASSANDRA: I don't know- you look like you've been around- and seen a few things.

ROBERT: I run a small business...

CASSANDRA: I know you're more than that.

Robert shakes his head.

CASSANDRA: And you want me.

ROBERT (Smiling, wryly): I thought it was the other way around.

CASSANDRA: I can give you money- a third of his estate.

Robert laughs absurdly.

ROBERT: Half.

CASSANDRA: Deal.

Robert looks at her angrily.

CASSANDRA: Dillon said it could take an hour to work. (Beat) But he should be unconscious for most of it.

ROBERT (Still angry): And how long has it been?

CASSANDRA (Thinking): Forty- five minutes...

ROBERT (Sighing): Then I'd better have a drink.

CASSANDRA: Scotch?

Robert nods. Cassandra gets him the drink, from a nearby table, and he watches her. She returns, handing it to him. He takes a drink, and then walks over to Mr Malone, and looks at him carefully. We get a Close Up of Mr Malone for the first time. He's red in the face, sweating, and breathing hard.

ROBERT: He looks like he has a fever.

CASSANDRA: So would you, if you'd been choking.

Robert looks back at her, harshly.

ROBERT: Get him a blanket.

CASSANDRA: What?

ROBERT (Firmer): I said get him a blanket.

CASSANDRA: (Sarcastically): Alright.

Cassandra exits, and returns shortly with a check/ tartan throw. She gives it to Robert, and he places it over Mr Malone- who moves quite aggressively.

ROBERT (Turning back sharply): Christ, what did you give him?

CASSANDRA: I don't know. This isn't supposed to happen.

ROBERT: Don't you think you should have checked it out first?

CASSANDRA: And how exactly would I have done that?

ROBERT: I wouldn't just have believed someone.

CASSANDRA: Dillon's had first hand experience- he works with psychiatric patients.

Robert laughs absurdly.

CASSANDRA: God, you're so arrogant. You've never been in my position though.

ROBERT: So what do we do? Just sit and wait?

Robert sits down on a nearby chair. He drinks his whiskey, and looks at his watch, dramatically. Cassandra goes over to Mr Malone, looking over him.

CASSANDRA: His breathing's getting quicker- maybe it will be over soon.

Robert looks at her- shaking his head, disbelievingly.

Suddenly, Mr Malone splutters to life- coughing heavily, with mucus running down his chin.

JOHN MALONE: What's all this? What's going on?

CASSANDRA (Taken aback): John dear- I'm here, it's ok- you're not very well. (Beat) Food poisoning.

Robert looks at her. She stares at Mr Malone.

CASSANDRA: I've phoned for a doctor.

She looks at Robert.

JOHN MALONE: I know what you're up to...

ROBERT (Standing): I'll get you a glass of water...

Mr Malone looks at Robert.

JOHN MALONE: I know you, don't I?

FADE

25. INT. PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES- DAY.

It is two years earlier (Maybe a title comes up). It is Mr Malone's office. It is old fashioned, with lots of wood/ oak, leather chairs and bookshelves. He is sat behind a large desk, and we are directly on him, as the scene begins. In the scene there are mainly Wide Shots, with some Close Ups and Two Shots, on Ian and Robert.

JOHN MALONE (Speaking into an intercom): No interruptions please.

The camera then Cuts To two gentlemen- Robert and IAN, sat in front of him, side by side.

IAN: Mr Malone, I'd like to introduce you to my associate- Robert Eastern.

Mr Malone barely acknowledges him.

JOHN MALONE: You've been my financial adviser for how long now?

IAN: About three years.

JOHN MALONE: And what have you given me?

Ian and Robert look at each other.

IAN: You're not happy with my work?

JOHN MALONE (Lighting a cigar): I want to know that you're still the best. (Beat) I'm looking at all my employees.

IAN: Sir, you have a solid portfolio, and we've offered you some good investments. Our firm has grown substantially, since we started it...

JOHN MALONE: That's not what I mean.

ROBERT: Look around if you're not happy.

Mr Malone looks directly at Robert.

JOHN MALONE: Why haven't we met before?

IAN: Robert goes after the leads. It's because of him, that we've been able to offer you such sound investments. (Beat) I do your day to day work.

Pause- Mr Malone smokes, and looks at them both.

JOHN MALONE: So tell me about my portfolio?

IAN: Solid, improving.

JOHN MALONE: Don't lie to me... I've been haemorrhaging money.

Mr Malone looks at a sheet of paper, on his desk.

JOHN MALONE: Investments? Down. In natural resources- minerals, energy and telecommunications. Only coffee and soya have improved.

Robert smiles slightly.

IAN: They have all been carefully chosen- and some are longer term. Markets go up and down.

JOHN MALONE: Thank you- I don't need a lesson in economics.

IAN: You told me a long time ago, you were prepared to wait...

ROBERT: You could always buy more property.

Mr Malone ignores Robert.

JOHN MALONE: And my tax position?

IAN: All above board.

JOHN MALONE: That's not what I asked.

IAN (Sarcastically, Smiling): Well, other than moving your residency to Jersey or Monaco, I don't know what else to suggest.

Pause.

JOHN MALONE (Laughing throatily): The press would have a field day with that.

ROBERT: I have some new deals...

Now Mr Malone looks right at him.

JOHN MALONE: Such as?

Ian looks at Robert questioningly.

ROBERT: Mr Malone, let me be blunt. You're a millionaire several times over. (Beat) Why don't you free up some capital, and have some fun.

JOHN MALONE: Mr Eastern, I don't take risks. I've had money my whole life, but it's not a play thing. I come from the newspaper business, and I can smell bullshit a mile away.

ROBERT: Well... I was thinking... Industrial in Iceland. Geo and Thermal power. The company Nordic Resources is looking for investors.

Mr Malone laughs, haughtily.

JOHN MALONE: Is that all you've got?

ROBERT: No. I was just thinking- renewable energy, fits in with your public image.

JOHN MALONE: I also invest in the airline industry. It's better that the public doesn't know about that side of my life. (Beat, thinking out loud) The Icelandic Agriculture and Environment Minister, is a good friend of mine...

Robert looks at Ian.

JOHN MALONE: Feasibility?

ROBERT: I'm flying out there this weekend. If you're interested.

JOHN MALONE: Come and see me when you get back, and if I like what I hear, it's a deal. (Beat) And there'll be a nice commission, for the two of you.

IAN (Looking at Robert): Your continued business is thanks enough.

JOHN MALONE (Smiling): Anything else you have?

ROBERT: A few things... Europe is a great place to do business at the moment. The Euro has never been stronger.

JOHN MALONE (Laughing again): The Euro will bring down this government.

Pause

JOHN MALONE: Cigar? Cognac?

IAN (Speaking for the both of them.): No, thank you.

Mr Malone pours himself a drink, and re-lights his cigar.

JOHN MALONE: Let's move things up a gear- but keep it between us. Here's my secure number.

He writes on a piece of paper, and gives it to Ian.

JOHN MALONE: Come to me first with any new opportunities.

He looks at Robert, and then sits back.

JOHN MALONE (To Ian): If you and your partner can deliver- now's your chance to prove it to me. (Beat) But don't let me down.

Mr Malone watches them for a moment. Ian looks worried.

JOHN MALONE: Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.

IAN: Of course.

Robert and Ian get up, and head for the door, as Mr Malone watches them- before putting his cigar down, and getting on with some work.

FADE

26. EXT. PARLIAMENTARY CAR PARK- DAY.

It's overcast and cloudy, as Robert and Ian exit the building. Ian stands there for a moment.

IAN: What was that all about?

ROBERT: What do you mean?

IAN: I thought we weren't going to offer him any more deals; it's all about keeping what we've got.

ROBERT: He was provoking us. It felt right.

IAN: Felt right? You don't know him.

They walk to their car.

ROBERT: Well, I'm not toading down to him.

IAN: He's our most important client.

ROBERT: No, we don't need him.

IAN: Robert, yes we do. (Beat) And those ones? I thought you'd changed- that's why you're on the front line.

ROBERT (Smirking): I've always been on the front line.

IAN (Stopping him): You know what I mean- you broker the deals- I deal with the clients. The way it's always been.

ROBERT (Looking at him): So why the change now?

IAN: Because I have a family. (Beat) I need my partner back, the one I started the business with.

ROBERT (They walk again): Relax, we'll make Mr "Home and Foreign Affairs Minister" some more money, and you'll be number one again. (Beat) Just keep balancing the books.

They get to their car.

IAN: That's the problem- I'm not sure I can.

ROBERT: Then get some help.

IAN: No.

ROBERT (Smiling reassuringly): You worry too much.

IAN: You can't help but "mix it up" can you?

ROBERT: Come on- have I ever let you down?

IAN: Well, there was that gambling operation you had on the side.

Robert laughs.

ROBERT: That was chicken feed.

IAN: But not very clever.

Roberts' mood darkens.

IAN: I want to downsize.

ROBERT: I thought we needed money.

IAN: We do, but it's not worth the risk.

ROBERT: Look, if he's willing to.

IAN: No. (Beat) Robert, listen to me, from now on I deal with him alone.

Robert looks at him blankly.

ROBERT: Ok.

He gets into the car. Ian pauses- and we view him over the roof of the car. He looks sad, and in disbelief.

FADE

27. INT. LOUNGE- DETACHED HOUSE, NIGHT.

We return to scene 24, as we left it.

ROBERT: No, I don't think so.

JOHN MALONE (Throatily): Yes I do... You're Mr Cranson's colleague.

Cassandra looks at Robert, who looks back at her, before turning around.

JOHN MALONE: What have you done to me? (Beat) Get some help.

They stand, frozen.

JOHN MALONE: Don't just stand there!

CASSANDRA: Darling... (Moving closer to him.)

JOHN MALONE: Keep away from me. (Beat) You (To Robert). Pass me the phone.

Robert doesn't move.

JOHN MALONE: Help me... I'm going to be sick.

Mr Malone rolls onto his side- gasping for breath, before falling back. He puts his hands to his face, mumbling to himself.

CASSANDRA (Aside- to Robert): What shall we do?

ROBERT: You're asking me?

CASSANDRA: We can't let him be sick... It will ruin everything.

ROBERT: I don't think we will be able to stop him- if he wanted to.

CASSANDRA: He's suffering... I never wanted that.

Robert gives her a 'give it a rest' look.

CASSANDRA: He said, he knew you.

ROBERT: Well he's wrong.

Robert turns and walks away.

CASSANDRA: He never forgets a face- or a name for that matter.

Pause- she follows him.

CASSANDRA: You do know him.

ROBERT (Turning back): Alright I know him. I've met him... Once.

Cassandra goes back over to Mr Malone- and it looks like he's passed out again, with his arm over his face. Cassandra then pours herself and Robert another drink, before going back over and joining him.

CASSANDRA (Giving him the drink): Tell me about it.

ROBERT: My business partner and I, once had a contract with him.

CASSANDRA: And you never mentioned this to me?

Robert looks at her blankly.

ROBERT: You came to me, remember.

CASSANDRA: What did you do for him?

ROBERT: Nothing. My partner was his accountant- cum financial advisor, and I brokered some deals.

CASSANDRA: Tell me you didn't lose him any money...

ROBERT: Around six months ago, he went missing- and I've been looking for him ever since. With his wife- Hazel.

CASSANDRA: What's his name?

ROBERT: Ian Cranson.

CASSANDRA: He resigned, didn't he?

ROBERT: That's the official verdict, but I intend to find out the truth. See, we fell out a couple of years back- we've been friends since University, and have had several businesses together; and I owe it to his family- wife and two daughters, to find out what really happened.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: So you're a good man, Robert.

He gives her a sly look.

CASSANDRA: And you suspect my husband?

ROBERT: Wouldn't you?

CASSANDRA: Yes. But this is quite a coincidence.

ROBERT: No it isn't.

CASSANDRA (Looking away, Brief Pause): Any leads at all?

ROBERT: Nothing concrete.

CASSANDRA: The authorities?

ROBERT: Not interested. Think he's gone on his own accord.

CASSANDRA: (Looking at him): Listen- you've helped me- I want to help you.

ROBERT: How can you?

CASSANDRA (Motioning to Mr Malone): We have him.

ROBERT: I don't know- I don't like the conflict of interest.

CASSANDRA: Do you want to find him?

Robert gives her a harsh look.

CASSANDRA: We'll find him- for his wife, and the little girls.

ROBERT: What happened between Ian and Mr Malone, for him to resign?

CASSANDRA: I don't know- things seemed to change all at once, with the scandal and everything.

ROBERT: Yeah I know, and the downturn in the economy...

CASSANDRA: And when he lost his place in the cabinet, his behaviour changed with people- his friends. (Beat) And he turned on me, he resented my detachment from it all.

ROBERT: So you've said.

CASSANDRA: You've seen how he is with me... (Beat) Look- it's been an hour, and he's still not dead- let's wake him up, and see what he knows.

ROBERT: I thought you didn't want him to suffer.

CASSANDRA: It's for the greater good... I'll go and find Dillon- and you two can talk alone.

Cassandra takes his glass, and they walk back over to the chaise longue. She bends over Mr Malone, and wakes him gently. He makes a noise like a 'wounded animal', and comes to.

CASSANDRA: Wake up darling. You must try and stay awake...

JOHN MALONE: Get away from me.

CASSANDRA: I'm going to get some help, but I'll leave you with Robert.

There's a Close Up.

CASSANDRA (Whispering in his ear): You must have a lot to talk about.

She kisses him on the cheek, and Mr Malone tries to push her away. He looks at Robert, weakly.

Cassandra collects her handbag off a nearby chair.

CASSANDRA (To Robert, softly): Anything happens, call me.

Robert looks away from her. There's a Close Up on Mr Malone, as he watches them.

Cassandra leaves the room- and we're left with Robert and Mr Malone. Robert moves towards him.

JOHN MALONE (Suddenly more alert): Well... Aren't you going to help me?

ROBERT: I don't know.

JOHN MALONE: I'll make it worth your while.

Robert smiles, strangely.

ROBERT: What can you possibly offer me...

JOHN MALONE: Money. That's what you wanted before.

ROBERT: That was business.

JOHN MALONE: And what's this?

ROBERT: Life and death.

Mr Malone coughs violently. He holds his stomach and chest.

JOHN MALONE: What has she given me?

ROBERT: A drug. (Beat) From what I hear, you should be dead already. But I can help you... If you help me.

JOHN MALONE: I thought you didn't want anything.

ROBERT: Only information. (Beat) She says you're a bad man- a violent man.

JOHN MALONE: And you believe her?

Pause. Robert looks straight at him.

JOHN MALONE: I'm not who she says I am!

ROBERT: No. You're only like every other politician.

JOHN MALONE: What are you doing here?

ROBERT (Shrugging): Giving advice.

JOHN MALONE: On killing me!

ROBERT: No... I helped her with the decision.

JOHN MALONE (Smiling craftily): She's set you up, you fool. (Beat) I thought you were a ruthless business man, not a killer.

ROBERT: I haven't killed anyone. But your life is ticking away...

JOHN MALONE: What happened to you?

ROBERT: Excuse me?

JOHN MALONE: We had an agreement, and you disappeared.

ROBERT: I didn't want to work for you.

JOHN MALONE: Couldn't stand the heat?

ROBERT: The smell.

JOHN MALONE: We could have made a lot of money.

ROBERT: (Scoffing) We'd have lost it all.

Pause

ROBERT: And Ian?

JOHN MALONE: Who?

ROBERT: Ian Cranson- my business partner.

JOHN MALONE: He disappeared, along with you.

ROBERT (Firmly): No- you're lying. He still worked for you, and I want to know what happened to him. (Beat) What did he do for you?

JOHN MALONE: My accounts.

ROBERT: And that's all?

JOHN MALONE: He was a good and loyal employee.

ROBERT: Was?

Mr Malone looks away.

ROBERT: We had a disagreement the last time I saw him- and I gave him my share of the business, and walked away.

Mr Malone scoffs.

ROBERT: All I have to go on is a list of our clients... And you're at the top of that list. Ian was a private man. (Beat) So you're going to tell me what you know.

JOHN MALONE: And you'll do what? Torture me?

ROBERT: I don't need to- the drug in your body is doing that.

JOHN MALONE: What is it?

ROBERT: A suicide drug. Slow, but effective... And I don't want to think about what's in it, and where it's from...

JOHN MALONE: Get it out of me!

ROBERT: That's the hard part. You'll feel nauseous, but I don't think you'll be sick.

JOHN MALONE: She's insane.

ROBERT: It's not my business. (Beat) She's gone to find Dillon. Know him?

JOHN MALONE: No.

Mr Malone coughs again, heavily- onto a handkerchief- and it's dark and red.

JOHN MALONE: Look at this- I'm coughing up my own blood!

ROBERT: Could just be those cigars you smoke.

JOHN MALONE: I can't breathe!

ROBERT: All you need is enough breath to talk... So start.

JOHN MALONE: I've got nothing left anyway...

ROBERT: Don't give me that. What about your plans for the future- your nest egg...

JOHN MALONE: I'm just like everyone else.

ROBERT: Bullshit. You had power and influence.

JOHN MALONE: So I like being rich...

ROBERT: I don't care about that.

JOHN MALONE: And I like women!

Robert smiles.

ROBERT: Abuse women. (Beat) It all comes back at the end...

JOHN MALONE: What do you want?

ROBERT: What did Ian do for you?

JOHN MALONE: I told you- he was my accountant!

ROBERT: Now I know it was more than that. (Beat) Anything illegal?

Mr Malone grunts.

JOHN MALONE: Ian??

ROBERT: Any lackey will do.

JOHN MALONE (Weakly): I want to sleep...

ROBERT: I know... But I'm going to keep you awake.

JOHN MALONE (Pleading/ Child-like): You want me to die... Let me sleep.

ROBERT: No.

Mr Malone tries to drift off. Robert shakes him.

JOHN MALONE (Deliriously): My troubles will follow you...

ROBERT: Ian went abroad, didn't he?

JOHN MALONE: You're not a criminal...

ROBERT: Answer me!

JOHN MALONE (Half- asleep): He went to Switzerland... Geneva...

ROBERT: And what was he doing for you there? (Beat) Answer my question, and I'll let you sleep for a minute- it will feel like an hour.

JOHN MALONE: My overseas banking...

ROBERT (Smiling): Nice try.

Mr Malone drifts off again.

ROBERT: Wake up! (He slaps him.)

JOHN MALONE: He was meeting clients... A new energy contract...

ROBERT: With whom?

JOHN MALONE: From the Ukraine...

ROBERT: Ian?? Negotiating? Why him?

JOHN MALONE: He was the best I had.

ROBERT: And then he disappeared. (Beat) Why did he agree to do it?

Pause.

JOHN MALONE: He was protecting you...

ROBERT: What??

Robert moves closer to him.

JOHN MALONE: After you came to see me... I had you followed. I didn't trust you- you were so different to Ian... So full of guile... MI5 have a record of you... You're a marked man... Anything happens to me, and you'll be hunted...

ROBERT: You're bluffing.

JOHN MALONE: Wait and see...

ROBERT: And Cassandra?

JOHN MALONE: She'll get what she deserves.

Pause- Robert shakes his head.

ROBERT: Sleep...

JOHN MALONE: Maybe just for a little while...

FADE

The following Five Scenes have a dream-like quality to them- similar to Scene 17.

28. INT. CORRIDOR, PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL- DAY.

Cassandra enters through some double doors, and walks along the corridor of a hospital.

29. INT. WARD, PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL- DAY.

Cassandra enters a ward, and walks over to a nurse's station.

CASSANDRA: Mrs Malone?

The male nurse recognizes her.

MALE NURSE: Go on through.

Cassandra walks to the end of the ward, and turns right next to a private room. Looking in briefly, she enters.

30. INT. PRIVATE ROOM, IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL- DAY.

As Cassandra enters- Mrs Malone sees her from her bed.

MARIE (Groggily): What are you doing here?

CASSANDRA: How are you feeling?

Marie turns away.

CASSANDRA: I've come, because John has asked me to.

MARIE: John?

Cassandra walks over, and takes a seat next to her bed.

MARIE: I know what's going on...

CASSANDRA: The truth is... John, can't live with it any more.

MARIE: Oh, can't he..?

CASSANDRA: No. It's damaging his career- and he can't keep it away from the media any longer.

MARIE: So what are you saying?

CASSANDRA: You disappear. You'll be looked after, but not known. (Smiling) And you'll get the best care available.

MARIE: You're a cold-hearted bitch. (Beat) Nurse!

Cassandra goes to her.

CASSANDRA: It's no good. It's over, and you're tired. Rest...

MARIE: You're mad!

CASSANDRA: Let me take over from you... Just until you're better.

MARIE: People know me!

CASSANDRA: No they don't. They only know of you. I can do a better job than you can, and you know it.

MARIE: You not only want my bed- but my life!

CASSANDRA: For John. For what you've been working towards.

MARIE: Politics? Is that all!

CASSANDRA: No, you're wrong. It's everything. To John.

MARIE: He'll... I'll never agree to it.

CASSANDRA: You don't need to. You gave up any legal right, when you tried to kill yourself.

Marie starts to cry.

MARIE: I need help.

CASSANDRA: I know you do, and you'll get it.

Cassandra takes out some papers from her bag.

CASSANDRA: Read this; and sign here, and let me help.

MARIE: This is ridiculous. Never.

CASSANDRA: It doesn't matter. Like I said. I just thought you might like to take it upon yourself. See you don't have any family... Who care about you... And with me and John, it's just a matter of time anyway...

MARIE: Why do you hate me so much?

Pause- Closer.

CASSANDRA: Because you're weak... And I don't want to be anywhere near you.

MARIE: You may sleep with my husband; you may try and look like me, and take over my life- but it'll never be real.

CASSANDRA: We'll see.

MARIE: This isn't possible.

CASSANDRA: Anything is possible, with the right influence.

MARIE: Let me speak to John- I want to speak to my husband!

CASSANDRA: I'm afraid he's busy right now.

MARIE: Well then, give him this message from me: He should choose his relationships more carefully.

CASSANDRA: Don't think about that now... Think about yourself... And sleep.

MARIE: You think you'll win? You won't, you'll only lose... You're just another tramp.

Close On- Cassandra looks over at her, and smiles.

FADE

31. INT. WARD, PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL- DAY.

Cassandra exits the room- and turns, and walks back onto the ward. As she walks towards the nurse's station, she smiles, and the nurse smiles back. She stops.

CASSANDRA: You go to The Attic, don't you?

MALE NURSE: Sometimes.

CASSANDRA: I Thought I recognized you.

MALE NURSE: I'm Dillon.

CASSANDRA: Cassandra.

They shake hands weakly. Dillon is in his late twenties- and is tall and good looking, with spiky- coloured hair.

DILLON (A bit flirtatiously): You'll have to come over and speak to me next time.

CASSANDRA (Plainly): Maybe I will.

DILLON: See Ya.

Cassandra smiles thinly, and walks away- back towards the entrance/ exit.

FADE

32. INT. BAR/ NIGHTCLUB- NIGHT.

It is a few months later- and Cassandra is stood with Dillon, and a few other friends, in a fancy bar/ nightclub.

CASSANDRA (Drunk): I think it's over... I don't think it's worth it any more.

DILLON: It's about time... He's a bully.

CASSANDRA: But... I've given him so much of my life... You can help me, can't you?

DILLON: Like how?

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Help me kill him.

Dillon smiles strangely.

CASSANDRA: You've told me what you do, for some of the patients at your hospital.

DILLON: I have?

CASSANDRA: Give me something... For him. I know I can trust you... You look after me...

DILLON: I could get into a lot of trouble... What I told you... I was off my head!

CASSANDRA: A suicide drug you said...

Cut To- Dillon, Close Up, High one night:

DILLON: I've found it... The drug that is something of an urban myth around the hospital. A by- product of the club/ rave culture. A bit like a date rape drug in its compound... But it offers people a clean way out. Stress free- it means they can die peacefully in their sleep- safe in the knowledge that their family and loved ones, won't find them hanging, or covered in blood. It's horrible I know- but it's a dream for a lot of my patients- and I dish it out to those most in need. (Pause, proudly) Death as it should be.

CASSANDRA: Aren't you worried about getting caught?

DILLON (Smugly): I mainly give it to day patients. Plus, it disappears from the system in a couple of hours. Imagine if it got onto the street, the sort of impression it would make. Depressives the world over- would have an answer- and could just, disappear... People die every day, and no one would know any different...

CASSANDRA (Smiling, in awe): You're mad!

Cut Back To- Dillon in the Bar/ Nightclub.

DILLON: And you thought I was serious?!

CASSANDRA: I know you have it... And I want to give it to John...

FADE

33. INT. LOUNGE- DETACHED HOUSE, NIGHT.

We return back to the set up in Scene 27. Robert is now sitting and smoking, and Mr Malone is unconscious. Cassandra enters, with Dillon.

CASSANDRA (Firmly, going over to Mr Malone quickly.): I thought we agreed to keep him awake.

ROBERT: Well, there was a change of plan.

She looks closely at Mr Malone.

ROBERT: He's still breathing... Who's this?

CASSANDRA: This is Dillon, he's here to help.

Robert scoffs.

ROBERT: Oh yeah?

Robert looks at Dillon, who nods in acknowledgment. Cassandra wakes Mr Malone, gently. He cries out. Dillon goes over to him.

DILLON (Speaking slowly, but moving quickly): I'm a friend of Cassandra's- I'm a nurse. How are you feeling?

JOHN MALONE (Gruffly, clutching his chest and stomach): How the fuck do you think?

Dillon tries to feel his forehead, and check his pulse. He looks perplexed.

JOHN MALONE: Get away from me you idiot!

Dillon and Cassandra go to the side.

DILLON: It worked?

CASSANDRA: What?

DILLON: I wasn't expecting it to work- I thought it would just pass through his system.

CASSANDRA (Angrily): You said you'd used it before.

Dillon shrugs.

DILLON: On psychiatric patients.(Beat) It seems to work in combination, with other drugs they're on.

Dillon gives Cassandra a questioning look.

CASSANDRA: Great... So what do we do now?

DILLON: Well, I can give him something to drink, to try and neutralize it in his stomach... If it isn't too late... Or more drugs, such as Diazepam or Lithium- an injection will act quickly- to try and trigger a reaction; that'll probably send him over the edge.

Cassandra gives him an exasperated look.

DILLON: I didn't think you were serious.

Pause- Cassandra thinks...

CASSANDRA: No, it's gone too far.

DILLON: And you're sure..?

We Cut To- Robert and Mr Malone in a wide shot. Then Cut Back To Cassandra.

CASSANDRA (Sarcastically): Yes.

DILLON: Well then... (Sighing) I'll go along with whatever you want to do.

Robert goes over to them.

ROBERT: Hold on... We need to talk about this.

Dillon looks at him with tired eyes.

CASSANDRA (To Robert): What?

There's a pause. Robert looks at Dillon distrustfully.

CASSANDRA: We've got to give him something.

Cassandra looks at Dillon, who shrugs.

DILLON: A shot of Lithium?

Robert laughs absurdly.

ROBERT: Hasn't this gone far enough?

Cassandra stares at Robert.

Close Up: Mr Malone is watching, and is fearful and shaking- his face still flush- and his eyes darting from person to person.

CASSANDRA (Suddenly aware of Mr Malone listening): What are you talking about?

Robert takes her to one side, in a Two-Shot.

ROBERT: Is there no way back?

CASSANDRA (Softly): Robert... We need to do this, now...

Robert shakes his head.

CASSANDRA: What did he tell you?

ROBERT: Not a lot. (Beat) There's still so much that doesn't make sense.

CASSANDRA (Touching his shoulder): We'll find him... Together... When all this is over.

ROBERT: And what about you- will you be satisfied?

CASSANDRA: I hope so.

ROBERT: This stinks.

CASSANDRA: I know you think that.

Robert looks sadly over at Mr Malone.

DILLON: Guys??

ROBERT: Shut up! (Beat) Who is this clown?

CASSANDRA: A friend... (Closer to him) No one really (Beat) Come on.

Cassandra goes over to Mr Malone, and Robert reluctantly follows.

CASSANDRA: Honey, we're just going to give you an injection- it'll make you feel better- and sleep.

Mr Malone shakes his head, but is otherwise motionless, and paralyzed.

JOHN MALONE (Fearfully): No.

ROBERT: Enough of this charade! He knows- well enough, what's going on.

Dillon goes to his bag, and takes out a small bottle and syringe, from a case.

CASSANDRA (Turning away): I can't watch.

ROBERT: Too real for you?

Close Up: Mr Malone is wide eyed and shaking.

Dillon fills up the syringe with a pale liquid, and he carries it over to them.

DILLON: Hold him down.

ROBERT: Not me.

Cassandra is frozen, and uncommunicative.

ROBERT: Cassandra!

CASSANDRA: I don't know if I can do that... (Pause) I don't like needles.

ROBERT (Laughing absurdly): You don't have to look at it! (Pause) You can do it...

Robert goes to her- and leads her over to where Dillon is now- next to Mr Malone. He then moves away- over to the far window, looking out.

There's now a Close Up, as Cassandra turns to Mr Malone- and his eyes are still wide. She shrieks, and holds his arms- looking away to one side. Mr Malone struggles, as much as he can- and Dillon puts the needle in his arm.

JOHN MALONE: This isn't over...

Mr Malone jolts suddenly, and then erratically- challenging Cassandra and then Dillon to hold him down. He then convulses- gritting his teeth, before crying out- and then gasping into a whimper.

There is silence for a moment- before they look at him. Dillon checks his pulse, before nodding. Cassandra touches his face, before looking down, and then moving away. Dillon follows her into the middle of the room. They breathe out heavily, and Dillon puts the syringe away. Cassandra then makes them some drinks.

DILLON: Not for me, I've got an early shift in the morning. I'm still on probation... For turning up late and hung-over.

Robert looks at him pitifully. Cassandra drinks down a large scotch.

CASSANDRA: Robert?

Robert turns to her. He walks over, takes the drink, and downs it in one.

ROBERT: I'm going to leave now.

CASSANDRA: Don't you want to stay and talk?

ROBERT: Talk about what?

CASSANDRA: What we do now.

ROBERT: What we do now- is run. (Beat) That's what criminals do.

DILLON: I think I'm going to go too.

ROBERT: Not before me.

Robert puts his glass down, and turns away to leave. Cassandra looks at him blankly. He looks back at the corpse on the chaise longue, and shakes his head. He heads for the exit- grabbing his coat- before turning back.

ROBERT: I expect this place is riddled with CCTV.

Dillon looks alarmed. Cassandra smiles.

ROBERT: One piece of advice. If you think you're being followed- you probably are.

Robert exits, leaving Cassandra and Dillon stood motionless.

FADE.

34. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. NIGHT.

Robert enters his flat, and tiredly takes off his coat. He then goes to the kitchen and makes a drink. Taking it, he then sits down on the sofa. He lights a cigarette- in the quiet and darkness- before lying down on the sofa, and drifting off to sleep.

FADE

It's now the morning, and Robert is awoken by the phone ringing, and it is like an alarm. He answers it, warily.

ROBERT: Hello?

HAZEL: Hi.

ROBERT: It's good to hear your voice...

We now cut again between Robert and Hazel like before.

HAZEL: So how are things... You never called me.

ROBERT: Sorry... I've been caught up with something. (Beat) Listen, I've had a hell of a night.

HAZEL: Tell me about it?

ROBERT: I'd rather not... But I've got some information.

HAZEL: Oh yes?

ROBERT: From the horse's mouth. (Beat) He may be in Geneva.

HAZEL: Really? Gosh. Well that's what you thought...

ROBERT (Sighing): Yeah... So I'll be leaving here today.

HAZEL: When will you be back?

ROBERT: I don't know- maybe I'll only be gone for a few days... But I won't be coming back here.

HAZEL: You know you can stay here anytime...

ROBERT: Thanks. (Beat) Well, I'll keep you posted

HAZEL: Please do. And take care.

ROBERT: Bye for now.

HAZEL: Bye.

Robert puts the phone down. He sighs, lights a cigarette- and then goes into the kitchen and makes some coffee- before going over to some mail, on the floor near the door. Taking it, he goes back to the sofa. He opens a large letter- reads it and then opens his laptop- doing some work.

ROBERT: There you go- leave her- be on your own, it's safer.

He prints a letter off, puts it in an envelope, and seals it- putting it to one side. He then stretches for a moment, and then packs a number of 'essential items' away into a couple of bags- and a few clothes- going into the bedroom briefly.

35. INT. BATHROOM- OFF BEDROOM, IN FLAT- MORNING.

Robert packs some bathroom items, before taking a shower.

36. INT. BEDROOM IN FLAT- MORNING.

Entering the bedroom, he puts on some casual clothing, before re-entering the lounge.

37. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. MORNING.

Robert goes back to the sofa, and opens his laptop. There's a Close Up- as he looks at some travel sites- and makes some bookings. He then closes the lid, stretches back out on the sofa, and drifts off to sleep.

FADE

There's a knock at the door. Robert gets up and goes over to it- cautiously. He looks through a peephole- and we see its view. It's Cassandra. He leans his forehead against the door for a moment, shaking his head.

Cut To- Cassandra, from the doors POV.

CASSANDRA: I know you're there... I heard footsteps, and I can see your shadow under the door.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Let me in... I need to talk to you.

Pause.

ROBERT (Tiredly): There's nothing else that needs to be said.

CASSANDRA: I know... I want to see you.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Don't you want to know what's happened?

ROBERT: No.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Come on... This is stupid. (Beat) No one saw me come in- no one knows I'm here...

Robert looks up. He thinks for a moment- and touches his face and stubble- and then crotch. He opens the door, and motions for her to come in. She enters, mock excitedly/ innocently- looking around. Robert goes and sits down, lighting a cigarette, and Cassandra joins him.

ROBERT: I won't ask how you knew where to find me.

CASSANDRA: Good.

ROBERT: So talk.

Robert swigs from a bottle of water.

CASSANDRA: Aren't you even going to offer me a drink?

ROBERT: No.

CASSANDRA (Now plainly): A doctor came... And confirmed his death.

ROBERT: And that's news?

CASSANDRA: There's a post-mortem.

Robert looks angrily at her.

ROBERT: I'm leaving.

CASSANDRA: Where will I find you?

ROBERT: You won't.

CASSANDRA: We should see this through. (Beat) Aren't you afraid of an inquest- and investigation?

Robert looks at her in disgust.

ROBERT: No, I work for Hazel Cranson. I have case notes- and her as a witness, to back up my story...

CASSANDRA: Isn't there a conflict of interest, somewhere in there?

ROBERT: Don't get clever.

CASSANDRA: You still came to my house- and were involved in a murder...

ROBERT: I didn't have a choice. And when you're dealing with someone like you- a psychopath- you rarely do.

Cassandra laughs hard.

CASSANDRA: You still worked for him.

ROBERT: No I didn't. There's no record of that. (Beat) I'm a life coach- I help people with their problems.

CASSANDRA: Rubbish. That's just a cover. A ploy.

ROBERT (Looking directly at her): You came to me.

CASSANDRA: Just the way you wanted it... How many clients have you had?

ROBERT: None of your business.

Robert shakes his head- and gets up, walking away.

CASSANDRA: I knew Ian personally. What if I told you I'd had an affair with him...

ROBERT: I'd laugh. You weren't his type.

Pause.

ROBERT: I couldn't place you, but I knew I'd seen you before. (Beat) Then, when I left your house last night, it came to me. You were his assistant all those years ago- you oversaw everything. (Beat) So how did you end up marrying him? Wasn't he already married?

CASSANDRA: It's complicated.

ROBERT (Firmer): Tell me the truth.

CASSANDRA: In law, no.

ROBERT: And Mrs Malone?

CASSANDRA: She died- took her own life. In hospital. She was a manic depressive.

Robert frowns.

ROBERT: So replaceable. (Beat) Are you that good a fuck?

Cassandra gives him a slightly modest/ girly smile.

CASSANDRA: She had to disappear, go away anyway- so why shouldn't I? The best person for it. Everyone accepted us as a couple... As it happened- he couldn't marry me in the end, and divorce her.

ROBERT: Why not?

CASSANDRA: He just couldn't.

Pause.

CASSANDRA: And I deserve something from all of this.

ROBERT: Money? His estate? (Beat) But it's not as simple as that is it? There's more to it...

CASSANDRA: I remember you too...

Cassandra gets up and goes over to him.

CASSANDRA: I liked you. (Pause) And then you started poking your nose into Mr Malone's affairs- so I thought I'd pay you a visit.

ROBERT (Dryly): Thanks very much.

She gets really close to him.

ROBERT: You're dangerous.

CASSANDRA: And you like that...

She kisses him, and they fall down onto the sofa, and have passionate sex.

FADE

Cassandra goes through to the bedroom and bathroom, and takes a shower.

As she's doing this we Cut Back To- Robert, who busily tidies up- and packs his things away, including laptop. Cassandra then appears in the doorway, when he's finishing.

CASSANDRA (Flatly): Where are you going?

Robert ignores her.

CASSANDRA: You're going to find Ian, aren't you?

Pause.

CASSANDRA: Can I come too?

ROBERT (Firmly): No.

Cassandra sits down on the sofa.

CASSANDRA: There's something else you need to know...

FADE

38. INT. STUDY- DETACHED HOUSE, DAY.

It is six months earlier (Maybe a title comes up with this, and/ or: `After The Scandal'). We are in Mr Malone's study, and there's a similar layout to his Parliamentary offices. Mr Malone is once again sat behind a desk, and Ian is in front of him- but this time alone.

JOHN MALONE: I've lost everything...

IAN: I know, I'm sorry.

JOHN MALONE: At least I'm ok financially. For now. And I have you to thank for that.

IAN: You're welcome.

JOHN MALONE: Ian, there's something I'd like you to do for me. (Beat) You're a good communicator, and I can trust you. (Beat) I need you to go to Geneva and meet some people for me.

IAN (Surprised): Who?

JOHN MALONE: Energy people. Tie up some loose ends.

IAN: I'm not a negotiator.

JOHN MALONE: There isn't much of that- I only need you to be a face- and you know all about my business affairs.

Mr Malone stands up, and walks a few paces.

JOHN MALONE: You see, I'm in a bit of a delicate situation- having lost my position in the cabinet. You understand. I need to reassure certain people. (Beat) And you, as my associate...

IAN: What about Cassandra?

JOHN MALONE: No. She can't do it.

IAN (Confused): It's not really what I do...

JOHN MALONE: I know, but I'll make it worth your while. It will only be a short trip- a weekend.

IAN: I don't like to leave the kids. Katie's just starting school, and Beccy's not sleeping very well...

JOHN MALONE (Stronger): Oh come on. It'll only be for the weekend. I'll be slowing things down now... And you'll get a nice bonus... Just in time for Christmas, eh? Useful to a family man... And I'll put you up in a nice hotel...

IAN (Sighing): I appreciate what you're saying- and I'd like to help you... But, I have responsibilities...

JOHN MALONE: What happened to that partner of yours? He was a bit of a wild card.

IAN: We're no longer working together.

JOHN MALONE: Oh, that's a shame- I must say he lead me down a merry path.

IAN: Well, that's in the past... You don't have to worry about him, any more.

JOHN MALONE: But I do you see. I like to know what everyone's about. So I had him checked out- and he certainly has a chequered past as far as the financial world is concerned. (Beat) He's a risk taker- And he's broken a few rules along the way. I know some people that would love to get hold of him...

IAN: Are you blackmailing me?

JOHN MALONE: No. (Beat) All I'm saying is- do this job for me... And we'll all be free and clear.

Ian sits back, and a thin smile creeps across his face.

IAN: If I do this... Then I will no longer work for you.

JOHN MALONE: Good, so it's decided then. (Sitting back down again) I'm relieved. So, I'll have everything arranged. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some calls to make.

Ian stands- a bit shell-shocked, and leaves the room slowly. Mr Malone uses the phone, and turns away from him.

FADE

39. INT. A LARGE AND SELF-CONTAINED, CITY CENTRE FLAT- LEEDS. MORNING.

We return back to Robert and Cassandra- as they were at the end of Scene 37- although Robert now stands over Cassandra, who still sits on the sofa.

CASSANDRA: Ian wanted to disappear. Let him.

ROBERT (Strongly): You're a liar. He'd never leave his wife and kids.

CASSANDRA: He was unsettled with family life- it happens.

ROBERT: This is ridiculous.

CASSANDRA: He confided in me- we were friends.

Robert stares at her, with an ironic/ sarcastic smile.

ROBERT: What are you after? What are you up to now?

CASSANDRA: Stay with me- we'll work this out together.

ROBERT: You're insane.

CASSANDRA: If you go- you'll be a wanted man... A fugitive.

ROBERT: (Smiling) I'll take that chance. It's You that should be afraid of the police.

CASSANDRA (Standing, coolly): No. They'll be after you, and only I can help you.

Robert laughs.

ROBERT: That's a joke.

CASSANDRA: They know all about you.

Robert goes up close to her.

ROBERT: Cassandra... It's over.

CASSANDRA (Shouting): Who do you think you're talking to- I'm his wife!

ROBERT (Exasperated): You're nobody.

CASSANDRA: I'm in charge of his estate!

Pause.

ROBERT (Smiling slyly): I bet it was you who leaked the story to the press- that created the scandal...

Cassandra is taken back.

CASSANDRA: How dare you!

Pause.

ROBERT: What partner wouldn't, right? (Pause) Did you want to destroy him from the beginning? (Beat, angry now) Why did you kill him? He wasn't that bad- surely. Greed? Power? Envy?

Cassandra laughs- weakly, and sarcastically.

CASSANDRA: You're so naive.

ROBERT: He Never hurt you, did he? Your bruises- self inflicted?

CASSANDRA: What's it matter. (Beat) It's what you all want to believe- the press, the public. The philandering, sexually aggressive politician.

Robert turns away from her in disbelief. He picks up his things, and walks to the door.

ROBERT: I'm leaving.

CASSANDRA (Loudly, and Matter-of-factly): You'd better run.

Robert exits without looking back. We end on Cassandra.

FADE

40. EXT/ INT. CAR DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS- AFTERNOON.

Robert drives to the airport. He's angry and perplexed, but determined.

41. EXT. GENEVA- LATE AFTERNOON.

There is a panorama of the City- along with maybe the title: `Two weeks later'- and we Cut To Robert entering a Geneva Hotel. It is a winter's day- in late November- and it is sunny, with light snow and ice.

42. INT. HOTEL ROOM- GENEVA- LATE AFTERNOON.

Robert enters the room- he is dressed casually, and is unshaven. He sits on the bed- and puts his head in his hands- before lying down, and closing his eyes. There's a Close Up- before we Fade. His mobile rings- and we Cut quickly to him sitting back up. He presses the button and answers it.

ROBERT: Hi Hazel.

HAZEL: Hi Robert.

We Cut between them again.

ROBERT: So you got my message?

Robert gets up, and goes over to a table by the window- where sun comes in- and he can see the City.

HAZEL (Excitedly): I can't believe it. We're overjoyed.

ROBERT: I told you I'd find him.

There's a moment's awkwardness.

HAZEL: And I knew you'd do it.

Robert smiles. Then his mood turns. He sits back down on the bed.

ROBERT: Well, I haven't actually seen him yet. I don't know what to expect.

HAZEL: He's not hurt?

ROBERT: No, I don't think so.

HAZEL: What's he been doing?

ROBERT: Laying low. I don't know the full details, but from what I do know- he's been hiding away from some bad people. Associates of the former Mr Malone, no doubt.

HAZEL: How did you find him?

ROBERT: Old contacts- and I asked around. Knowing he was in this City has made it easier. (Beat) I had to talk to a lot of people, and trying to stay out of public view has been hard. But it's all true- everything he said.

HAZEL: We'll work it out.

ROBERT: I know- I'm just so angry still. (Beat) I'll be sorry to drag you into all of this...

HAZEL: Don't worry about that now... We'll face that later. (Beat) I started this, didn't I? I kept pushing you.

ROBERT: I'm not sure you did. You gave me more of an incentive. (Beat, awkwardly) And piece of mind. You know I wouldn't have been able to do this without you...

HAZEL: I didn't do anything.

ROBERT: Yes you did. You did so much.

HAZEL: It's brought us together... And I'm happy about that. (Smiling) You were barely a friend before. I hope you'll stay just as close, when he's safe. (Beat) The girls are very fond of you...

ROBERT: And I am of them. (Beat) He's been moving from place to place- I managed to get in touch with him, through a hostel he was staying in.

HAZEL: How did he seem... Sound?

ROBERT: Afraid. (Beat) I just want to see him, now...

HAZEL: When?

ROBERT: Later, this evening.

HAZEL: How do you think he'll be with you?

ROBERT: Ok I hope. Water under the bridge, and all that.

HAZEL: He's lucky to have such a good friend.

Robert laughs weakly.

HAZEL: Really.

ROBERT: Right... Well, I should have a shower.

HAZEL: Ok.

Hazel gets emotional and tearful.

HAZEL: Give him our love... And tell him how much we're missing him.

ROBERT: I will. (Beat) He'll be missing you too.

HAZEL: Should I come out there?

ROBERT: No. There's really no need.

HAZEL: Are you sure?

ROBERT: Look, we'll talk again later ok. I'll give you a ring when I know more.

HAZEL: Yes, as soon as you can! (Beat) And try and get him to call me! If he wants to...

ROBERT: I'll try.

HAZEL: You'll be ok?

ROBERT: I will.

HAZEL: Where are you meeting him?

ROBERT: A bar by the river.

Pause.

ROBERT: I just want to talk to him- and find out more, and try and help. That's all. (Beat) And I owe him an apology. He didn't sound that happy to speak to me, so I may have some work to do. But he still may be protecting me- if what Mr Malone said is true.

HAZEL: You boys. It's not you and him I worry about...

Robert laughs, a little harder than before.

ROBERT: I'll speak to you soon.

HAZEL: Ok then... Bye.

Robert puts the phone away. He walks away from the bed, and goes to a bag. He takes out a handgun, and places it on the bed. He goes into the bathroom- loosening his clothes.

43. INT. BATHROOM- OFF BEDROOM, IN HOTEL ROOM- GENEVA. EARLY EVENING.

The bathroom is brightly lit, as Robert gets undressed. He looks at himself in the mirror, above the sink, for a long time. He turns on the shower, and steps under it.

FADE.

44. EXT. GENEVA- EVENING.

Robert walks to the tavern, through the streets of Geneva. It is cold, and he wears an overcoat, trudging onwards. The streets are softly lit by lamps, and there is snow on the ground. He turns, and enters a riverside bar.

FADE.

45. INT. RIVERSIDE BAR/ TAVERN- GENEVA. EVENING.

The bar is quaint, and darkly decorated. Robert sits by himself, drinking a beer, in a booth- and he can see the entrance. The place is quiet- almost empty. Cut To- a man enters. He wears an overcoat and a fur hat- and is shivering and cold. He takes his coat and hat off, putting them on a coat stand- as he sees Robert- who nods to him, smiling thinly. The man, IAN, goes over to him. A Close Up, shows him to be scruffy, and dirty- with wet matted hair- clinging to his face. They hug affectionately- and an open fire, catches Ian's his eye- in the corner. Robert sits back down, and Ian sits opposite him.

ROBERT: Jesus mate... I don't know what to say. (Beat) It's just great to see you. (Pause) I'll get you a drink.

Robert goes to the bar and gets a large Brandy, and takes it back to the table.

ROBERT: Drink this... It'll warm you up.

IAN: Thanks.

Ian cups it, and then looks up at him, weakly.

IAN: Who have you been talking to?

ROBERT: No one.

Pause. They drink.

ROBERT: So where have you been hiding?

IAN: Around.

ROBERT: Sleeping rough?

IAN: Sometimes.

Pause.

IAN: How did you find me?

ROBERT (Smiling slightly): Oh... You know me. A great investigator.

Ian attempts a smile.

ROBERT: Are you hurt.

IAN: No. (He coughs slightly).

Robert smiles again, affectionately.

ROBERT: What have you been through- tell me. I hardly understand it all.

IAN: You have to pay your debts... Someone always comes to collect.

ROBERT: What?

IAN: The Karlorov brothers.

ROBERT (Thinking he knows the answer): And what business are they in?

IAN (Coughing again): Energy, Racketeering. Eastern Europe. They have their fingers in a lot of pies.

ROBERT: A big market- but a weakened one; and since Mr Malone's lost power- they are worried about their investment.

Ian nods.

IAN: Authority and respect, are a big thing for these guys.

Pause.

ROBERT: So what do they want from you?

IAN: Nothing. I'm just collateral. I came here to improve relations between the two parties; but one party backed out on me. Mr Malone. He disappeared.

ROBERT: Disappeared?

IAN: Yes, to me. All communication.

Robert looks angry.

IAN: But a lot of money was lost... And someone's got to pay.

ROBERT: And it's usually someone innocent.

IAN: I managed to get away from my hotel, where they tried to keep me. And since then, I've been hiding out. I haven't known what else to do. I can't go home.

Robert nods.

IAN: Anyway, I can't leave the country, because I don't have my passport. I left with just the clothes on my back...

ROBERT: It's probably best that you don't try- they'd have no doubt had that covered.

Pause.

ROBERT: Mr Malone is dead.

IAN: I know. (Beat) I've been reading newspapers from home...

ROBERT: It was Cassandra.

Ian looks at him- questioningly, with shock.

ROBERT: It was all very surreal, believe me. You wouldn't believe this woman.

IAN: She's ambitious. And she knows what she wants.

ROBERT: She said you were good friends.

IAN: I hardly ever spoke to her. She detested me.

Robert nods.

IAN: Where is she?

ROBERT: I don't know. Under arrest, hopefully.

Pause.

ROBERT: The police may be after me...

IAN: What?

ROBERT: I've been caught up in it. (Beat) She came to see me, and asked for my help.

IAN: In what?

ROBERT: I've been doing some life coaching.

Ian looks at him in disbelief.

IAN: All this stinks.

ROBERT: Tell me about it. (Beat) You know she wasn't his real wife...

Ian looks straight at him.

IAN: It was none of my business.

Robert nods.

ROBERT: And now she's after his money.

IAN: She won't want me standing in her way then...

Pause.

ROBERT: What do you know?

IAN: That there's a will- John and Marie's will.

ROBERT: Do you have it?

IAN: No, but it's safe- along with some other documents I may need. (Beat) How proper and up to date it is though- I don't know.

ROBERT: Cassandra knows, I bet. Clever.

Ian nods, sadly.

ROBERT: John and Cassandra were never a legitimate couple...

IAN (Exasperated): No... But she acted like they were. It's a sham- a common-law marriage at best.

ROBERT: One of her fantasies... But you all went along with it.

IAN: Power can have that effect. It can make you turn a blind eye.

ROBERT: And John and Marie's marriage was never annulled?

IAN: No, I believe not.

ROBERT: But she must have something... Something in writing, from Mr Malone.

IAN: He probably promised her the world... But will it stand up in court?

Robert sighs, shaking his head.

ROBERT: So what do we do now?

IAN: Go to the police.

ROBERT: Come on... You know I can't do that.

IAN: You have to. We have to.

ROBERT: What about the people after you?

Pause, Ian looks away.

ROBERT: Let me speak to them.

IAN: No.

ROBERT: Then I'll go to the authorities.

Ian thinks, and reluctantly nods.

IAN: But speak... That's all.

ROBERT: Sure. I'm always making a deal, right?

Ian tries a smile again. He goes into his pocket, and takes out a pen and scrap piece of paper. He writes down a number, and gives it to Robert.

IAN: Be careful.

ROBERT: I will.

Pause.

ROBERT: You haven't asked about Hazel... And the girls.

Ian brightens up, with the mention of them.

ROBERT: They're fine... They miss you- and they send their love.

IAN: With any luck, I'll be out of this soon.

Robert nods.

ROBERT: Look Ian, I'm sorry about what happened...

IAN: You don't need to be.

ROBERT: But how we left things... We were friends... For a long time.

IAN: It happens. In business.

ROBERT: I think I'm better off on my own.

Ian looks at him, closely, and affectionately.

ROBERT: I would have got us into trouble sooner or later.

Ian smiles properly, for the first time.

ROBERT: Rest assured, I'll do everything I can.

IAN: I know. Thanks.

Ian stands up, uneasily.

ROBERT: I can't leave you like this... Come back to the hotel with me...

IAN: No, I can't... Not tonight... It's not safe.

ROBERT: Well then... Do you need anything? Money?

IAN: No, I'm alright. (Beat) I've been getting quite resourceful.

Robert smiles.

ROBERT: Meet here again tomorrow night? Same time?

IAN: Ok.

He stands.

ROBERT: Take care.

Ian nods, turns around, and then goes to leave- stopping to put on his coat and hat first. We follow behind him, as he exits the bar. Cutting Back to Robert- he's sat back down, and he's looking into his unfinished drink.

FADE

46. INT. HOTEL ROOM- GENEVA- NIGHT.

Robert opens the door to his hotel room, and enters. Closing the door- he then goes over to the bed and sits down, before lying down. There's a knock at the door. Robert gets up, and answers it. Cassandra is standing there- in profile- lit against the background. She is wearing a tight black dress.

ROBERT (Looking her over) I knew you'd come.

He holds the door open- moving aside- and she steps into the room, confidently. She looks around, cautiously. She turns back, as he's closing the door.

CASSANDRA: Where is he?

Robert sighs.

ROBERT: You mean you haven't come to see me?

CASSANDRA: I've had you watched, you know.

ROBERT: I don't care.

She sits on the bed- crossing her legs.

CASSANDRA: I know you've already met him, and you're going to again.

ROBERT (Smiling): Do you?

He walks over to her.

ROBERT: So what's he worth?

CASSANDRA: What do you want?

Robert looks her up and down.

ROBERT: He's my friend.

CASSANDRA (Smiling): You're his assistant. He doesn't need you...

ROBERT: No, maybe not.

He strokes her face. She turns away from him. He grabs her hair, pulling her back to him. She gives him a sultry/ confident look- but she's passive and submissive.

Robert kisses her, and they fall onto the bed. They have strong, almost violent sex; as Robert grabs and holds her, around the arms and throat- and she tries to fight and hold him off. He bites her- and she screams, and hits him across the face. They come, and lie motionless apart.

FADE.

Cut To- Robert sits up, smoking. Cassandra looks at him, angrily.

ROBERT: What do you really want?

CASSANDRA (Confused): What do you mean?

ROBERT: When will you be happy? People are a game to you.

CASSANDRA: You have to go after what you want.

Robert gets up.

ROBERT: You don't understand the trouble you've caused.

CASSANDRA: Don't be a child.

Robert quickly tries to grab her across the bed- and she moves off it. He scrambles over it- and pins her up against the wall- by her throat.

ROBERT (Angrily): What is it you want!

CASSANDRA (Softly): I just want to talk to him. (Beat) I want you.

Robert lets her go, and walks away.

CASSANDRA (Rubbing her throat): You don't want money... You don't want me... What do you want?

Pause. She thinks.

CASSANDRA: Hazel... You'll have Hazel and the kids...

Robert moves back towards her, angrily. She tries to face up to him.

He stops, and calms down. He points to the door.

ROBERT (Firmly): Get out.

Cassandra gets her things- takes one last look at him, and exits.

FADE.

47. EXT. OUTSIDE RIVERSIDE BAR/ TAVERN- GENEVA. EVENING.

There's a wide path and bank, next to the bar. There is snow on the ground- and it's snowing, lightly. There is streetlamp lighting- but there are a lot of shadows. Ian is waiting outside- standing still, and shivering- with condensation coming out of his mouth. Robert arrives.

ROBERT: What are you doing out here?

IAN: Fresh air.

Robert looks at him curiously.

ROBERT: What is it?

IAN: The flu- don't worry.

ROBERT: Come inside- I'll get you a brandy...

IAN: No.

ROBERT: Ok.

They stand there for a moment. Robert has his hands in his pockets- Ian has his around his waist.

IAN: Have you called the police?

ROBERT: No... (Ian looks away, Beat) But I've made us an appointment for tomorrow morning, at the British Embassy.

IAN: Good.

ROBERT: We should both go together- and tell them our sides of the story.

Ian nods.

ROBERT: I have some evidence... And so do you- so we need to tell them what we know.

Pause.

ROBERT: There's something else... Cassandra came to see me last night.

Ian stares at him- anxiously.

IAN: Do you think she'll come here?

ROBERT: I would think so. But don't worry.

IAN: I could kill her.

Robert nods, and looks into the darkening evening.

ROBERT: I know... Have you seen anyone suspicious at all?

Ian shakes his head. Robert looks at him.

ROBERT: No one put anything into your drink?

IAN: What?

ROBERT: Nothing.

IAN: I haven't been able to drink much.

ROBERT: Where've you been staying?

IAN: A hostel. (Beat) Although I'm a bit over the average age.

Robert smiles.

ROBERT: Come back to the hotel with me tonight. (Beat) Have a bath- put on some fresh clothes, and you'll be in a better frame of mind tomorrow.

IAN (Nodding): Maybe you're right.

ROBERT: This weather'll kill you.

There's a brief smile from Ian.

IAN: All I want to do now is go home- and get back to normal.

Pause.

ROBERT: Maybe you'll feel like talking to Hazel later... She wanted me to ask you...

IAN: I don't think I can.

ROBERT: Well it's up to you. You can always call her from the hotel...

Ian doesn't look at him.

IAN: I'm afraid things have changed...

ROBERT: Nothing's changed. She still loves you.

IAN: I've made mistakes. Things I'm ashamed of.

ROBERT: You're not the only one.

There's a faint smile from Ian.

ROBERT: I've only ever passed through this place- Geneva. (Beat) But in its own way, it's perfect.

Suddenly, Cassandra appears from the side of the bar- behind them. She is wearing a white fur coat and hat- almost the colour of the snow. They hear her approach, and turn around.

ROBERT: Well well.

IAN (Angrily): W-what are you doing here?

CASSANDRA: Relax- I just want to talk.

ROBERT: I thought you preferred action over talk.

CASSANDRA (Half-Smiling): Things can't stay as they are...

ROBERT: No, I suppose not. (Beat) So how does it end?

IAN: If you don't turn around and leave right now- I will strangle you.

Cassandra laughs- shaking her head, and Ian stares at her. Robert motions for him to back down/ relax, and reassures him. He looks around.

ROBERT: On your own?

Cassandra moves closer to Robert, and puts her arm through his.

CASSANDRA: Have you told him about us?

ROBERT: No... Not yet. (Beat) Ian, this is my whore.

Ian scoffs, and shakes his head. Cassandra smiles.

CASSANDRA: Hazel's a lucky woman. Fidelity is a beautiful thing... Robert here, would put his dick in anyone.

Robert smiles.

CASSANDRA: He's been staying with her you know...

ROBERT (Laughing): Oh, you've got to try harder than that.

IAN (looking straight at her): I never trusted you.

CASSANDRA: You never tried to stop me though- so you're complicit; just as Robert is, for helping me.

Robert shakes his head.

IAN: I never knew the full extent...

CASSANDRA: No... You were only one of his closest advisers.

IAN: So were you! He trusted you!

CASSANDRA: You fool. If you only knew.

ROBERT: That story's over, sweetheart.

CASSANDRA: I know you have something about me... Important documents. And I want them.

IAN (Coughing): Something standing in your way? (Beat) It was your idea, I come out here, wasn't it?

CASSANDRA: Someone had to.

IAN: After the scandal, I was the only person left he could turn to. Where were you? But you knew that; just like you knew that you'd be left with nothing.

CASSANDRA: I'll be just fine... Don't you worry about me.

Suddenly, Ian collapses to the floor. Robert rushes down to help him.

ROBERT: What is it?

IAN: My heart... It's racing.

Robert shoots Cassandra a look. She shrugs, innocently.

ROBERT: Try and keep calm- breathe, I'll go and get some help.

Robert tries to make Ian comfortable, and then rushes into the bar. Cassandra kneels down next to him.

CASSANDRA: Poor boy... We could have helped each other.

IAN: You don't believe in any of that.

CASSANDRA: Who will take care of your wife and children...

IAN: They'll be just fine...

A gunshot rings out, and Cassandra is shot in the chest- her white fur coat, now covered in blood. She falls down- partly on top of Ian, and he pushes her off.

FADE

Robert returns. He takes one look at Cassandra- before looking around. Ian is quiet- breathing hard- and holding his chest tightly.

ROBERT: An ambulance is on its way.

He looks at Cassandra's body again- and shakes his head. He pulls it over to the river- and pushes it in. He then returns to Ian- and sits down next to him- putting his arm around him, keeping him warm.

We Pan Out- into a view of the whole area- as the Emergency Services arrive.

48. INT. A NEW AND MODERN OFFICE- DAY.

It is several weeks later. Robert and Ian sit opposite each other- in Roberts' new office. The office has a few more of his things- suggesting more permanency. The set up also mirrors scene 38, with Mr Malone and Ian.

ROBERT: So I called one of the Karlorov's.

IAN: Who did you speak to?

ROBERT: Konstantin.

IAN: The milder of the two. You were lucky.

Robert nods.

ROBERT: He was very happy to talk to me, as it turned out; and he was more than glad to get his hands on Cassandra...

Cut To- A phone call between Robert and Konstantin Karlorov. Konstantin is thin, rough looking, and unshaven.

ROBERT: Karlorov?

KONSTANTIN: Yes, this is Konstantin.

ROBERT: You don't know me... I'm an associate of Mr Cranson's

KONSTANTIN: Where is he?

ROBERT: Never mind that. I have some information for you... A trade, if you like...

KONSTANTIN: I am listening...

Cut Back To- Robert and Ian.

IAN: And by killing her, they'd get their hands on his estate- and get their money back.

ROBERT: Yep.

IAN: Clever.

Robert smiles. There's a pause.

ROBERT: It's great to have you back.

IAN: It's good to be back. A month in hospital, is about all I can take.

ROBERT: It's a good job it was only the flu- mixed with Cassandra's crazy drug- that kept you there.

IAN: A weak immune system... I wasn't exactly taking very good care of myself.

ROBERT: But that's understandable.

IAN: They were very interested in that drug.

ROBERT: Let's hope they find Dillon... Before he does any more damage...

Ian nods.

ROBERT: How are things at home?

IAN: Ok, really.

ROBERT: What do you mean?

IAN: We're having some time apart. (Beat) I still see them almost every day though.

ROBERT: Oh?

IAN: I just need a break.

Robert nods.

ROBERT: Keeping busy though?

IAN: No.

Robert smiles.

IAN: Kind of. (Beat) Well, I've started writing...

ROBERT: A book?

IAN: I don't know yet... Maybe a novel.

ROBERT: You?

IAN: Don't be so surprised... I used to write a lot when I was younger, at college. Before I met you.

ROBERT: No... That's good then. (Beat) What's it about?

IAN: A thriller.

Robert nods.

ROBERT: If you ever need a hand... Any ideas...

IAN (Smiling): Thanks, but I've got enough material for now. (Beat) How's the new business?

ROBERT: Fine- but I'm just getting started. (Beat) I could always use some help from you... When you're ready. We could even have the same arrangement as before.

IAN: Thanks, but right now I'm enjoying some time off...

ROBERT: Ok.

IAN: Hazel's back at work, and strangely I get to see the kids more than I did before...

ROBERT: That's great. (Beat) Look, what Cassandra said... About me and Hazel... We never...

IAN: I know...

Pause.

ROBERT: What a time, eh? I'm really glad most of it's been sorted out- apart from the inquiry in Switzerland about Cassandra's shooting, that I have to go over for.

IAN: Well, be careful.

ROBERT: I will. (Beat) I'm just glad they let you give testimony over here.

IAN (Smiling): Me too.

ROBERT: With you and Hazel as my witnesses, they had to give me the benefit of the doubt; and Cassandra exaggerated any investigation on me, to keep me moving.

Ian nods, smiling again.

ROBERT: She really was something...

IAN: It's tragic how the worst kinds of people, leave the strongest impression. (Beat) She had it coming...

Robert nods.

ROBERT: Best try and forget about her now.

IAN: Case closed.

ROBERT: I hope so.

Pause.

IAN (Motioning to the door): Missing persons?

ROBERT: It had to happen.

IAN: A real detective.

ROBERT (Smiling wryly): It's a growth industry. Better than Life Coaching, anyhow.

IAN: You could never have an ordinary job...

ROBERT: No, probably not.

IAN: So what are you working on?

ROBERT: A fifteen year old girl has gone missing- may have run away- I've got a lead in Belgium.

IAN: Much of a family?

ROBERT: A mother.

IAN: Going over there?

ROBERT: As soon as I can.

Robert turns his attention, to paperwork on his desk.

Pause.

IAN: I'll leave you to it, then.

ROBERT: Ok mate.

Ian and Robert stand, and they shake hands.

ROBERT: We'll have to get together, for a meal and a drink, when I get back.

IAN: That'd be good.

Ian walks to the door, and Robert goes with him. When he gets there, he turns around.

IAN: Maybe I could help you with something... In a week or two.

ROBERT: I'd like that. (Beat) I'll email you something. But see how you feel... And keep on with your book.

IAN: I will.

Robert squeezes the top of his arm.

ROBERT: All the things we've been through...

Ian smiles.

IAN: As long as I've known you.

Robert holds the door open for him- and he walks away. We stay on Ian, and fade- before the door is closed behind him.

THE END
