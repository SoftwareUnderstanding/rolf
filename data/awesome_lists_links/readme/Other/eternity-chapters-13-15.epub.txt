# Fall is upon us, will it fall on us?

It's September. It's also been two years since I met Robert and Henry Winters. It's also been nearly five months that I have been dating Ryan Matthews. The leaves were changing colors and the wedding season has finally come to a trickle. At the end of the month I will be shutting down the studio for two weeks for vacation. We close two times a year; once in March, to prepare for the season, and the second time, in the fall to mark the end of wedding season. My employees like the prearranged times off. They mark it on their calendars like it's a goal to work towards. I had apprehensions about this vacation. The last one was wonderful but the one before didn't go so well. Robert and I had a big fight almost bringing an end to our 'relationship'. We worked it out and ever since then he has been wonderful. He sends me little gifts to my home address. Never work so no one gets suspicious. Nothing as extravagant as the earrings he gave me in July but there are mementos that I cherish none the less.

Ryan is wonderful. We see each other almost every other night. We go on real dates. Sometimes we cook in and spend the nights having spine tingling sex. He doesn't understand why he can't take his vacation with me at the month's end. He thinks I'm going to Georgia to visit my mom. He hasn't met my family yet. I've met his son, Sean. Him, I'm in love with. You can't help but fall for an adorable now six year old. Henry has been keeping in better contact with me. He sends me an occasional email telling me what new old film he's found that we should watch together or whatever pops into his head at that moment. I am careful about what I talk to Henry about. I don't mention Ryan to either of them that would be too much to handle.

The night before Robert and I were to leave for our vacation, Ryan was over. We were lying in bed basking in the afterglow of the aerobics we just performed when he asked me again about going to Georgia. I told him that I wasn't ready to let my mom loose on him yet and trust me he would appreciate it later if things ever get that far. I got up to take a shower. I didn't know what time exactly Robert was arriving and I needed to get Ryan out of the house just in case he decides to pop in in the middle of the night. When I got out of the shower Ryan was sitting on the edge of the bed.

"Kris, I think that we are at a crossroads in our relationship. I love you. I know I said that I wouldn't pressure you to tell me if you feel the same and I'm not about to do that now. I just want to be sure that there is at least a chance that this is going to go further than dating. While you are away please take some time to think about where you want this to go, okay?" He crossed the room and took me into his arms. "One day I hope you will tell me that you love me. And when you do that will be a great day for both of us. I can wait. But don't make me wait too long." He kissed me passionately before letting go and getting himself dressed.

"I will think about what you said. I'll have an answer when I get back." I left out of the room to pack some items I kept hidden in one of the spare rooms. Items that Ryan does not need to know about. I quickly packed some in the bag and left it in the room. I walked back to the bedroom to start packing some more items from my closet.

"Your phone rang while you were gone."

"Who was it? Did you answer it?" Please don't say his name, I thought to myself.

"It was a blocked number. I answered it but no one was on the other line. I guess it was that secret boyfriend of yours." He laughed at that as he came to wrap his arms around me. "I'll miss you while you are gone." He kissed me before letting me go.

"It must have been a wrong number. Besides, I'm always either with you or at work. When would I have time for someone else?" In my head I was freaking out.

"Well you do go out of town a lot. But I have nothing to worry about. I could tell if you had someone else just by the way you kiss me and what you do to me in bed. Enough of this crazy talk. It's nearly 11 and I need to get going if I'm gonna let you get some sleep." He kissed me again and walked out of the bedroom. I heard the front door open then shut. I waited until I saw his headlights heading down the road before I grabbed my cell. I punched in Robert's number and waited for him to answer.

"Has he left yet?" Was how he answered his phone.

"Yes. He just left. Where are you?"

"We're circling your block waiting for him to leave. I'm heading back now. I think I see his car driving past now." He paused. "So that's the other man. I can see now that I have nothing to worry about." He boasted.

"Just hurry back. I can't wait to see you."

With that I hung up the phone and raced downstairs to wait for him in the driveway. A few minutes later a black Mercedes pulled up. Marcus was driving. The back door opened and out stepped a Grecian God. I know it's only been three months since I'd seen him but every time I do it surprises me how sexy he is. He closed the door and walked over to me. With a quick kiss we greeted each other. We walked inside followed by Marcus who was carrying an overnight bag he had retrieved from the trunk. He gave me his customary nod and grunt before following us inside.

"I didn't know when to expect you. When did you get here?"

"About 45 minutes ago. When we got here I saw a car in the driveway and figured it had to be him. I called but he answered the phone. I was very tempted to say something to him but I didn't want you to get mad at me before our trip. He's okay looking. He doesn't really seem your type." He smiled again.

"So what is my type?" I wanted to hear this.

"Oh, about 6'2", blond, blue eyes, Belgium, with a big dick." As he said that he came to press his big dick against me.

"So that's my type. I was kinda hoping for something similar but with large fingers and a desire for some kinky stuff. But if that's all you have to offer. I guess I'll just have to keep on looking." I looked up at him and gave him my innocent look.

"I have all of that to offer and more. Do you want to know where we are going for our anniversary?"

"Of course. I still haven't packed yet because I didn't know what weather to pack for."

"I found this cabin in Banner Elk, North Carolina. Just you, me, and the wilderness. It's not too cold during the day so we will be able to take walks. But at night when the temperature drops, we can build a fire. Make a bed out of blankets, and take advantage of the alone time. And I mean alone time. Marcus is staying here with Shep. He rather enjoyed himself the last time."

I glanced over at Marcus. He and Shephard were playing tug-o-war with one of his chew toys. I looked back up at Robert. He was smiling as the scene the two of them played out in front of us. I rested my head on his chest and gave him a tight squeeze before wiggling out of his arms. I had to finish packing. Robert followed me into my bedroom. I didn't realize until then that I hadn't had a chance to change the sheets. I stripped them off and casted them in the corner. I went to the linen closet and selected another set. Robert stood by the window staring at nothing as I remade the bed. He didn't turn back around until I was done. I went over to him and ran my fingers through his hair. I could tell that he was thinking again. I didn't have ask what about.

"Does he come over a lot?" He asked quietly.

"You are not supposed to ask questions about him. Just as I am not supposed to ask you about her." I reminded him. I moved to sit on the freshly made bed. He stayed by the window.

"That was before I saw him and heard his voice. So answer the question. Does he come over here to have sex with you a lot?"

"Not really. Mostly we are at his place. This is making me uncomfortable. Can we talk about something else?"

"In a minute. Does he make you feel the way I do when he's kissing you? When he's touching you?"

"No. It's different. That's all just different. You are willing to do the things to me that I enjoy where I wouldn't dare approach the subject with him. What he does do to me, I can live with. Of course he want more but I'm satisfied with the way things are. At least with the way things are in bed." I realized I had said too much. But I couldn't take it back.

"He's in love with you."

Hesitantly, I nodded yes. I knew the next question so I answered it before it was even asked. "I am not in love with him. I know that. I do love him but I can't give him my heart. Besides you would know that before he did. I would be honest with you and tell you the truth if I was in love with him." I stayed seated on the bed staring at the floor wondering if the words I just told him were the truth. He walked over and knelt down in front of me. He placed one hand on my knee and used the other to lift my chin up so that I could look him in the face. I closed my eyes as my head was being lifted. After taking in a deep breath I opened them and looked into his. In them I found safety and strength. But I also saw hurt and worry. I leaned to him and kissed him. It was a slow sweet kiss. I like these.

"I know you will tell me the truth. I just don't know if I will like it when I do hear it." He stood then and walked to the door. "Our plane leaves in an hour." He opened the door then closed it behind him.

I quickly threw some jeans and long sleeve shirts into my suitcase along with the new nighties I bought special just for Robert. I zipped it and went to the other room to grab my fun bag before meeting him downstairs. His mood hadn't changed much from before. I hoped this wasn't a prelude to how this trip was going to be. We parked the Mercedes in the garage and drove my car to the airport since I was supposed to be out of town. We walked to the private landing strip and boarded the plane. We hadn't spoken the entire drive to Dayton. Once we were fastened into our seats the plane taxied the runway and off we went. When the seatbelt fastened light went out I released the latch and lifted the arm rest that separated us. I reached over and released him from his. While I was fidgeting with the belt, Robert turned his head towards me.

"What are you doing?"

"I was remembering the last time we were on a plane together. We were alone but you were still on probation. You asked me to do something and I refused. So I figured, we are alone again and you are not probation. Also how far back does these seats recline?" I got the buckle released and placed my hand on top of his crotch.

"The last time I said that you weren't interested."

"It wasn't that. You were just coming off of probation and I wanted you to suffer just a bit more. Don't tell me that it wasn't worth the wait." I said as I continued stroking the outside of his pants. I could feel his dick began to respond.

"Yes it was worth it." A smile flashed across his face as he was remembering that night. "Get over here and let me show you what I would have done to you that night."

With that I came to stand in front of him. Thank goodness I had the foresight to wear a skirt. He reached his hands under it and yanked down my panties. I heard a rip as he continued to release me from them. I leaned to him and kissed him openly. I stepped out of my torn panties as he rubbed my vagina. I leaned back on the seat in front of me allowing the pleasure to take me over. He stopped long enough to undo his pants and pull them down to his ankles. I sat on his lap and guided his newly hard penis into me. He grabbed onto my waist to control the rocking and grinding that I was performing for him. I placed my hands on the top of his head rest for support as I lifted up and down on him. He was biting his lip so I knew that he was having trouble holding on. I slowed my movements to force him to calm down. I looked into his eyes before kissing him again. I stood only to turn around. He guided me back down onto his still hard cock. With his hands on my shoulders, he increased the intensity of my bounces. I had to grab on to the seat in front of me. He fucked me hard. I heard him let out a gruff sound as he squeezed my shoulders tighter. I wanted to be with him when we climaxed but there was no way I was going to give up this ride. Faster I allowed him to fuck me. Harder. Faster. Until finally the rush I desired came over me. I could feel the hot cum escape him as he continued to fuck me. I fell back into him chest. He grabbed onto my breasts. He crushed them with his strength. I continued pounding on his lap until the wave finished washing over me, leaving me exhausted. I turned my head to kiss him and he answered it hungrily. Slowly I allowed him to exit me before standing and making my way to the restroom.

"If I had known that it would have been so much fun I would have given in the last time." I told him upon my return to the cabin.

"I hope we didn't disturb the pilots. We want them to get us there safely." He grabbed my hand and kissed it. "Happy anniversary."

"I can't believe it's only been two years. I can't remember what it was like before you came into my life. We've had our ups and downs but I wouldn't give it up for anything."

"Does that include him?"

"Yes, that includes him." I knew I had spoken the truth.

The flight was only three hours long. The drive to the cabin was an additional 30 minutes. The house was beautiful. It was a two-story log cabin that over looked a lake. I was able to walk in on my own two feet. I couldn't compare the mansion in Fair Haven to this cabin. They were both beautiful and somewhere I would have never stepped in before I met Robert. The living room was open with a huge bay window to allow it to be lit by the sun coming up over the lake. The fireplace was the size of the closet in my bedroom back home. After bringing in the luggage, Robert went back out to get some logs. I decided to take a tour. The kitchen was a dream. If I were a better cook I would have been in heaven. Every appliance was stainless steel. The pantry and fridge were already stocked. I guessed he came up before we got here. I left to find the bedroom. There were two bedrooms on the bottom floor so that puts the master bedroom upstairs. The bed was covered with a beige goose-down comforter topped by a faux fur throw and several pillows. I checked out the bathroom and saw one of the reasons he may have chosen it. There in the middle of the bathroom was a claw foot tub. I smiled when I remember the last one we were in. I returned downstairs to find him lighting the fire. It roared to life as I hit the last step. He stood up and marveled at his masterpiece.

"I've always known you were good at getting things hot." I said to him.

He turned to look at me. He was wearing that gorgeous smile that made me only want to get closer to him. So I did. I wrapped my arms around and breathed him in. I could feel the warmth of the fire behind us. I could smell the earthy scent of pine and cedar that was crackling. I don't know how long we stood there like that holding each other. All I knew in that moment was that this was the exact place I wanted to be. I felt his fingers tip toeing down my spine. I looked up at him and saw that his eyes were closed and he had a faint smile on his face. He seemed to be having a wonderful dream at the moment and I so much wanted to know what it was about.

"You seem lost in thought." I inquired when he finally opened his eyes and found mine.

"I was thinking about you. I missed the way you felt in my arms. These trips are starting to seem too far apart. I almost forgot."

"I'm sorry I can't get away as often as we would like. But with both of our schedules, it's hard to drop everything."

We finally parted. I walked to the couch and sat down. He walked to the door to retrieve our bags and took them upstairs. When he returned he had a small package in his hands. He came to sit with me. Robert appeared hesitant to give me the package. He began playing with the white ribbon.

"Kitten, I know you don't like for me to give you gifts. I was pleased that you accepted the earrings. But this one you may see as a bit much. First, I want to explain why I got it, then I'll explain why I feel it is perfect for you, then I'll give it to you. You can decide then if you want to keep it."

I waited for him to start. I could hear his breath settle before he spoke again.

"For two years now you have been more to me then I could have realized. From that first meeting I knew that you were special and I will admit I was pleasantly surprised by the way you make me feel every time we are together. We fight hard. I think we do that because this is something that has turned into more than a casual friendship. At least to me it's no longer a friendship. It's more than that. You are more to me than that. Sometimes I close my eyes and see you there. At night before I fall to sleep I hear your voice beckoning to me, urging me to come to you. I need you more than I would like to admit without scaring you away. When I saw him... you can't imagine the hate and loathing that consumed me. When he answered your phone, I wanted to reach through and choke him with my bare hands. When I came in to your bedroom and saw that the bed was unmade. I saw that this was where he had not an hour before with you. It took everything in me not to set it on fire. He was touching you whenever he wanted to and I can't do that. He is building a future with you. He is taking a place in your heart and life that I want to be but know I should never want because this is something I can never have. When I gave you the earrings and you accepted them I was very happy. I imagine you in them whenever I think of you. I imagine you twirling them around thoughtlessly thinking about me. How many times have I imagined that? Now let me explain the gift. I gave you the earrings to represent me but this represents us. I want that when you wear it that you would consider me in his place. Rather above him in both your heart and mind."

With that he handed me the box. My hands were shaking hoping that it wasn't what I was thinking it was. Little blue boxes tend to do that sometimes to a girl. Slowly I slid the ribbon loose to allow the secret that it was holding back to come out. I removed the ribbon. I looked up to him. He was staring down at the box so he didn't see the anxiety that was building in my face. Using my thumb and forefinger I opened the lid. Then I saw it. It was beautiful. In the box lays a silver charm in the shape of two hearts intertwined around a single diamond on a delicate silver chain. He reached for the necklace and held it in the palm of his hand.

"Each heart represents each of us. And the diamond represents the strong bond between us that can hopefully never be undone. Do you like it?"

"It's beautiful. I love it. Put it on me."

I turned my back to him and raised my hair so that he could clasp it around my neck. I also took that moment to let out a breath of relief that this necklace wasn't a ring. He kissed me on the back of my neck. I let my hair fall then fell backwards gently into his waiting arms. He wrapped his arms around me. I lifted the necklace to get a better look at it. He was right it was perfect. We were two parts that were bonded not by a diamond but by a so far successful secret. I allowed it to fall and laid my hands atop his and locked my fingers between his. I watched the fire leaping dancing around for a while before closing my eyes to shut out the world and to only hear his heartbeat. We laid there a long time wrapped up in each other's arms. We must have fallen asleep because when I did open my eyes again it was morning. The fire had diminished to a thin layer of glowing embers. I don't remember Robert getting up leaving me on the couch, but I was covered in a soft cashmere throw. I could smell coffee brewing from the kitchen. A few minutes later, he walked into the living room carrying a tray loaded with sweet rolls, fruit and two cups of coffee.

"Good morning, sleepy head. Happy second anniversary, Kitten." He said setting the tray down on the coffee table before giving me a quick kiss on the forehead.

"Morning. I'm can't believe I fell asleep out here. Happy anniversary to you also." I responded.

"I don't mind. We were both exhausted from yesterday. What do you feel like doing today?"

"First, I want a roll and a bit of coffee before I shower then we can figure out the rest." I reached for a roll and broke a piece off and slid it into my mouth.

"I wanted to thank you for last night."

Assuming he meant the little thing on the plane I replied, "I sure hope the pilots have recovered from our antics last night."

"No, I meant for accepting my gift. You have no idea how much it means to me for you to take it so easily. Especially after what I said about why I wanted to give it to you."

"Robert, I appreciate you telling me the truth. I know it couldn't have been easy. Besides, I love the necklace. It's lovely and it means a lot that you were able to tell me how you feel. I get glimpses of your heart when we are bed but to hear it coming from your lips means more than you can imagine."

"Finish eating. Then go freshen up. I don't want to waste a single moment of the next two weeks."

I finished my coffee and took the sweet roll with me up to the room. I found that he had already unpacked his bag and left mine zipped on the bed. I guess he was trying to respect my privacy. I put the roll in my mouth and unzipped my bag. I pulled out some clothes and underwear. When I reach into the side pocket to get my toiletries bag something sparkly hit my eye. It was the sun glittering off the diamond of my necklace. I reached for it and looked at it again. It means a lot to Robert for me to keep it. I wanted to keep it. The question that stared invisible at me was will this eventually lead somewhere I didn't want to go? I didn't want to think about it then so I undressed there in the room and dashed to the warmth of the hot shower that soon followed. After washing and getting dressed, I grabbed my bags and began to unpack. I grabbed the bag with my little toys in and dumped it into the bedside stand. I then began to unpack my clothes. I was surprised that Robert had me left alone for as long as he has. Maybe he was unsure still of my reaction to his gift. I decided that I will finish later and stashed the half full bag in the closet before returning downstairs. He wasn't in the living room where I had last seen him. I checked the kitchen but he wasn't there either. The back door was slightly open. I walked to it and saw him standing on the deck peering at the lake. I didn't know how big the lake was until now. I opened the door slowly and went out to join him. I walked to his side.

"I was thinking that we could go out on the lake today but it may be too cold for that. Are you up to taking a hike?"

I placed my now cold hands into my pockets. I looked down at my feet. Staring at my new tennis shoes I didn't know if I really wanted to ruin them. But if it took Robert out of his funk then they will have to be sacrificed.

"Sure. Is there a map of the area so we don't get lost? I'm not too good at the outdoor activities but I'll try anything once."

"We don't have to go out if you don't want too. I was just making a suggestion seeing how my initial plan isn't going to work out. We could stay in and watch some movies. When we were here earlier stocking up, I saw there was a large collection of DVDs in the den. We could just stay in."

With that that he turned and started to walk into the house.

"I want to go hiking. That's final." I huffed before turning, beating him back into the cabin.

This was going to be a tough vacation. He was already in a mood and I didn't know how to fix it. He found a map in a desk drawer and found a close and short route. I filled two water bottles and found a backpack in a closet. I filled it with a couple of sandwiches and leftover rolls from this morning. I also grabbed a blanket incase the ground was too cold when we did stop for lunch. I was finishing up when he came into the kitchen with my coat. I looked into his eyes and they appeared to be stressed. I wanted to ask him what was the matter but I decided to leave well enough alone. Sometimes it's better not to ask.

By the time we get out it was nearly 10. We walked east around the lake and found the trail quite easily. I let him lead the way in case there was any brush ahead that needed to be moved out of the way. We must have walked for an hour without even saying one word to each other. I stopped to take a quick break but he didn't even notice that he was so far ahead of me. I struggled to catch up to him. After another hour of walking and being ignored, just ahead I saw a clearing. Well not quite a clearing but a spot that didn't have quite as many trees and a descent spot to stop. He walked right past it. I didn't. I stopped and rested against a tree. I bent down to test the ground to see if it was too cold to sit on. I pulled out the blanket and sat and waited. Eventually he would notice that I was no longer behind him and come back to find me. By now I really didn't care. That eventually took nearly 10 minutes. I could hear him calling my name. He was getting closer so I didn't worry about yelling back. I sipped my water and rested my back against a fallen tree trunk.

"There you are. Are you hurt? I was so worried when I didn't see you."

"I'm not hurt. I'm fine."

"Then what's wrong. Why did you stop?"

"You seemed to be enjoying your brisk walk through the woods I didn't want to slow you down. Actually this was the second time I stopped. You didn't notice then either. I figured you would come back eventually and see I was right. Here you are."

"What are you talking about? You are the one that said you wanted to go hiking." He sat on the tree trunk.

"I only said that because I noticed that you were in a bad mood and I hoped that this would help clear your head or at least put you in a better mood."

"I'm not in a bad mood. I just have a lot of stuff going on right now and I don't know how to settle it."

"You know you can always talk to me, Robert. I will help as much as I can."

"What if the problem is you?"

I was taken aback by this. "What do you mean? I am the problem?" In the back of my mind I remembering last night's confession by him and then repeated what he just said and didn't understand. How could I be the problem?

"Just know that I didn't mean to do it. I wasn't trying to find anything. I was only trying to help."

"You are starting to scare me. What have you done?"

He took in a deep breath. He reached into his pocket and pulled out something that was black. I didn't recognize it as belonging to me so I didn't reach for it.

"What is that? What does that have to do with me?"

"I found it in your luggage. This morning while you were still sleeping, I went up to unpack. I was trying to be helpful. It was in the side pocket with your toiletry bag. I guess he figured that you would find it... this. I didn't know what to do with it so I left your bag on the bed and sat there for a while deciding whether to tell you about it or not. I was going to drop in into the middle of the lake but we couldn't go boating today so I figured I would hold on to it till I decided." With that he shoved it away from him and out to me.

It was a black silk bag. It didn't seem threatening. I opened the cinch and dumped the contents into my hand. Out fell a gold circle with a diamond on one end. No, no, no, this is not happening. I quickly returned it to its bag. I closed my eyes and wished as hard as I could that it would disappear. I opened my eyes and looked in my hand. It was still there. There's no way for this to go away. There's no way that this never happened. I glanced over to Robert. He seemed to have melted into the wood. He hadn't moved. He continued to stare at the ground. I searched for the words. I thought about last night when I was hoping that his gift wasn't an engagement ring when all along I already had one. One that I didn't want. One that came from someone that I am not in love with. Wait. What? I'm not in love with Ryan. Oh my. I am not in love with Ryan. I love him, yes. But it's not the same as being in love with him. Then why didn't I want to let him go? It took me a minute to figure it out. I didn't want to let go because he was my back up. He was my just in case. He was my warm body to keep me satiated between my trips with Robert. I know I've said before that I wasn't in love with Ryan but this time I meant it. This time I knew I was speaking the truth. He wanted me to think about our future and maybe he hoped that this ring would force my hand. Well it definitely did that. I knew in that instant. The moment that ring was in my hand that I do not love Ryan Matthews. Now for the fun part. Fixing things with Robert then ending things with Ryan.

"I am not in love with him." Even to me it sounded like a whisper. Too low for even the air to hear. "Did you hear me? I said that I am not in love with him."

"You must've had an inkling that he was thinking along these lines. That he wants to marry you. A man doesn't just get these kind thoughts without the woman giving out hints no matter how subtle."

"I promise you, I had no idea. He told me that he was in love with me and was willing to wait for me to say it back. But he did say that he wanted to think on it seriously while I was away. I guess this was his way of making sure I gave him the answer that he wanted. But as soon I saw this ring I knew instantly what my answer was. No, I am not in love with him. I care for him but I can't be to him what he wants me to be."

"Are you sure? You are not saying this because of what I said last night or because you don't want to ruin this trip if it's our last one?" I see the worry build in his eyes.

I clutched the heart charm on the necklace he gave me and kissed it. I came to sit next to him on the log. With my left hand I stroked his bangs off his forehead and trickled my fingers along the side of face. I then placed that same hand on top of his shoulder than stroked down the length of his arm before finally resting my hand on top of his.

"Look at me." I waited for him to turn. "I think that I was using him. I used him to replace you in my life. He was safe. He was public. He was available to me whenever, where ever, and I didn't have to hide being with him. We can't have that. I think that was why I stayed with him so long."

"That's not who you are, Kris. You don't use people. Not like I do."

"That was true at one time. But now look at who I have become in the past two years. You didn't know me before. I would have never stayed with a guy this long if I didn't think that it was going to lead somewhere. But I lead Ryan on. I made him think that he was the only one in my life. I made him believe that I was satisfied with him in every way. I've become a great con artist. I wonder what my next trick will be."

"I did that to you. I made you that way. I will make it up to you. I seem to be doing that a lot don't I."

"Is that only reason you were mad this morning?"

"Yes and no. I was thinking about the ring and I was wondering how you would react if I gave a ring to someone else. Would you react the same way that I am? I am acting childish. Territorial. You don't belong to me but when we are together that's all I want. I felt like he was here, represented by that small ring."

I could hear his voice start to loosen. There was an air of laughter in that last line he spoke. I shoved the bag into my pocket and allowed it to disappear from my thought. Now I had to work on erasing it from his. I would handle this Ryan mess when I got home.

"Are you hungry? I fixed a few sandwiches. They are in the bag."

"Actually do you mind if we head back to the cabin?"

"Sure. Help me repack this blanket and we can head back."

After strapping the backpack back on, I turned to go down the trail in the opposite direction we came. I was leading this time. I was in a hurry to get back. I had damage control to take care of. We made it back by 1:30. It was quicker getting back because it was all downhill. I threw the backpack onto the kitchen counter and began to unpack. Robert came in a few minutes later.

"What?" I smiled at him.

"Nothing. I was just admiring you. I can't believe I nearly lost a day being mad over nonsense. Why do you put up with me?"

"You make a mean croissant and jam. And you make pretty good coffee."

"Come here." He leaned against the doorframe.

"Why?" I tried to sound coy.

"You have been too far away from me all day and I don't think I can stand it much longer."

"If you want me you will have to come get me."

He smiled before coming to stand behind me. He placed his hands in my hair and lifted it up to get a better angle of my neck. I felt his cool lips skating down the nape of my neck. I dropped the food on the counter. He moved to the side of my neck. Tilting my head to one side he licked the along the crook sending shivers along my spine. I placed my hands palms down on top of the counter to keep from falling to the floor. He knows where every pleasure spot is on my body and my neck is the most sensitive. I felt my hair cascade back down before I felt his hands on my arms turning me to face him. I looked up into his eyes. Where I saw worry before now I only see burning desire. Swiftly he moved the food over from behind me. I pursed my lips when he put his hands on my hips to lift me up and set me down on the counter. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and began running my fingers through his hair. I leaned forward and ran my cheek against his. First one side and then the other. I opened my legs wide to allow him to come closer to me before wrapping them around him. I could feel his already hard cock brush against my leg even through both of our jeans. All that did was made me pull him into me closer. I kissed the tip of his nose then both eyelids. I kissed his forehead, both cheeks, and then his chin. He looked at me and smiled.

"We should have done this instead of going hiking."

"Now you tell me. Now my new shoes are ruined."

"I guess we ought to take them off then."

Using one foot and then the other I removed my shoes. They landed with a thud on the ceramic tile.

"And you did get a little sweaty, I'm sure. Why don't we remove that shirt so it can get washed?" He undid the button of my shirt allowing it to fall behind me only to reveal a t-shirt under it. He reached behind me and pulled my shirt out my pants. He lifted it up over my head and casted it to the floor. This time my shirt revealed my bra underneath. That didn't stay on long either. I stretched my arms behind me and placed my palms back down on the counter. I arched my back as he came to kiss the tops of each breast.

"I'm sure you worked up a sweat, too. Maybe your shirt needs to be washed also." I reached for his shirt and began undoing the buttons. He placed his lips on mine and took my breath away. He was moving with the desire of a man who was tasting ice cream for the first time and liked it. A lot. I finally got his shirt free and casted it to the floor followed by his undershirt. I was able to catch my breath when I was lifting his shirt over his head but as soon as his head was free he was back on my lips. I tried to match his enthusiasm but his was overpowering. I felt his hands undoing the snap on my jeans. I leaned back and lifted off the counter when he began yanking them down. I watched as he kicked off his shoes and stripped down to his boxers. This man had ridges in all the right places and I had licked every single one of them. He reached his right arm around me to the center of my back and jerked me forward into him. His left hand came up and clamped onto the back of my head. We were kissing again. I barely had moments of breath. He used his hand to keep my face where he wanted me. He jerked my head back so that he could lick me down the front of my neck. He hovered over the crease on the side of my neck before giving it a quick lick before he began to nuzzle it. He was nibbling my neck in that ever sensitive spot he seems to always find perfectly. I could feel the moistness build in my pussy. I think I must have let out a sigh of pleasure. I raked my finger nails down his back. He pulled back away from me. I guess I must have done it too hard. When I looked at his face he had a smile so big that I knew that it was a good kind of hurt and it was driving him wild. He reached his hand between my legs and under my ass to get a good grip on my panties. He skillfully removed them, thank goodness without tearing them. I leaned to tug on his but he slapped my hand away and did it himself. I took this opportunity to admire his naked body. Sure I've seen it hundreds of time before but every time is like the first time, a real treat. I looked at his fully erected penis and licked my lips. I want to suck it. I want to have it in my mouth, in my pussy. I just want it. I reached out for it with my hand. He came forward to stand between my legs and allowed me to take him into my hand. I wrapped my fingers around him and gently squeezed. We stared at each other while I stroked his hard, hot cock in my hand. Every so often I saw his eyes roll back letting me know that he was enjoying himself. Using his right hand, he stroked the side of my face. He placed two fingers over my mouth. I opened my lips to allow him to slip them inside. I rolled my tongue over his middle and index finger as if they were the cock that I was still jacking off. He removed his fingers from my mouth and dragged them down my body until he reached my ready and willing pussy. First he played with my clit. I intensified the stroking I was doing to him in response. Slowly he inserted those two fingers into me. I squeezed him harder and continued to move my hand up and down along his shaft. In and out he moved those digits. Slow deliberate strokes he made. He leaned forward and kissed my lips again. As we kissed he increased the speed of his strokes. I tried to continue stroking him but I couldn't concentrate on what I was supposed to be doing. I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him closer to me. This only made him increase his strokes. I didn't want it to be over just yet. I had to hold on and not cum. I lowered one of my hands and forced him to stop. He knew immediately what I was after. He pulled me to him so that I was partly off the counter. He licked the fingers that he had removed from me and then placed them in my mouth so that I could have a taste also. Now I know why he loved to lick my pussy so much. He removed his fingers and kissed me again. While we were kissing he guided his patiently waiting dick into my womanhood. It felt like Christmas and my birthday all rolled into one. I wrapped my legs around his hips to keep him deep in me. It was a bit awkward but I didn't care. I had his cock in me and I wasn't going to let it go. As he pounded my pussy I threw my head back too far and hit it on the upper cabinet.

"You okay? Keep your legs wrapped around me. I'm going to lower us to the floor."

Without removing his dick from me, he gently led us to the floor. I didn't even notice the cold tile. I did notice the deep long strokes he was giving me and I accepted everyone without fail. Robert's hands were on either side of my head so I grabbed them to grip. I raised my hips when he pushed and lowered them when he backed out. We were in rhythm. We were together. Above me was the sea blue I yearned to see when I was about to allow the wave to crash over me. My soul floated up into them and became lost. Staring at him I barely notice when the warm wave rushed upon me. It hit me hard knocking the wind out of my lungs. I let go of his arms and grabbed his ass pulling him to stay inside of me. Making sure he stayed right where I needed him to be. The wave kept sending mini quakes over my body. I felt the warm flow of him being injected. I saw in his eyes when he allowed himself to be swept over. This image I wanted to keep in my mind forever. He collapsed half on half off of me. I couldn't move. I didn't want to move. I reached for his hand and placed it over my heart. I wanted him to feel what he did to me. I wanted him to know how my body reacted to him.

"How's your head?"

"It hurts a bit but the coldness of the floor is helping." I didn't realize until then just how cold that floor really was.

"Can you get up? Come with me." He stood up first then reached down to help me up. I saw him grab the once forgotten sandwiched from the counter and we made our way to the living room. He sat me on the carpeted floor and lit the fireplace. He must have restacked it while I was in the shower earlier. He grabbed some blankets from a side armoire. He arraigned the blankets about me before coming to sit next to me. He handed me a sandwich. I was starving. I had only had a sweet roll for breakfast. After a nearly 4 hour hike and then an enthusiastic sexcapade I was starving. But, I was starting to feel better. I laid my head on his lap. We watched the fire for a while without speaking, just enjoying our food and the stillness of the room. I loved these moments. There wasn't any arguing. There wasn't any tension. There wasn't anything attacking. It was calm. It was peaceful. It was frightening. I say that because it made me too comfortable. It made me want to have things like this always. And I mean always. Not necessarily with Robert, but with any man. But, there's that but again. I know that it would be hard. Because to have this sense of non-drama, would mean not having Robert anymore. That's the frightening part. I didn't want to imagine him not in my life. I felt his hand began to play in my hair. I rolled over in his lap to look up at him. He was already looking down at me smiling.

"You seem content with something", he remarked.

"I am. I enjoy this, being with you", I didn't want to say too much.

He didn't saying anything for a while. We continued to look at each other for a bit longer.

"I never did ask if you liked my surprise a couple of months ago."

A bit bewildered about what he was asking me about. It took me a few seconds to think about the surprise. Then it dawned on me. He was talking about Henry's visit. I would never tell him what actually happened and I'm a bit surprised that Henry didn't tell him about the events that transpired that night at the hotel.

"You mean Henry's visit? It was great seeing him. We stayed up watching movies and talking. I've missed him."

"He didn't tell me much about the visit. He had been a bit out of sorts but since his visit to see you he has seemed a bit more of his old self. I think the breakup with Rochelle really did a number on him. You are a Winters' boy best medicine. Thank you for that. At least the whole trip wasn't a complete bust."

"What do you mean?"

"The accounting firm we were looking at, according to Henry, wasn't as good as we were informed them to be."

"Oh." I wondered if part of his decision had to do with Ryan working there. Henry wouldn't be that spiteful. Would he?

I turned my head to gaze into the fire. Each flame was like a secret I have stored in my heart. I'm keeping secrets from my staff, Ryan, parents, friends, Robert. Everyone. Well almost everyone. Henry knows all of my secrets. He's the only one I can talk to about everything. But he's not here.

I feel Roberts hand stroke my hair. His breathing seems content and happy. He leans down to kiss my cheek. I turn so that our lips meet instead. I don't want to think right now. I just want to feel. I just want to feel his hands on me. I want to feel the heat from the friction our bodies create when we make love. I want to be consumed by it. I want the flames to take me away from every secret before my house of lies comes burning down to ash. I leaned up so that Robert knew what I wanted. I pressed my mouth to his and licked his lips. He held the back of my head to keep me close to him. I can feel him lowering me and attempting to slide his legs from under me. I want to dominate him. I want to be in control of my destiny. I use my hands to push him up and tear myself away from his kiss. I look into his eyes willing him to understand what I want. All I see is confusion mixed with desire. I proceed to get up from the floor only to straddle him. His back is to the couch so I use it to support me as I find a comfortable position to sit on his lap facing him. Without even waiting to see if I was ready, I forced him into me. No sound is made from either of us. I feel his hands on my back then his arms come to completely circle me as if he is trying to make us one. I begin to move up and down on top of him. My arms are on his shoulders and around his neck. He begins to move with me. Still not a word or sound is made between us. We watch each other. I feel the heat from the fire on my back as I feel the heat from our bodies consume us. I continue to move up and down. Up and down. Slowly, gently up and down we move. We can't stop looking into each other's eyes. I feel his breath on my face. Up and down, I continue to take him into me. As he rocks his hips forward to stay in rhythm with me. I hear his breath catch so I know that he's close. But I'm not ready. I feel his arms tighten around me. I see the struggle in his eyes as he's trying to hold on. I began to move slower. I don't want him to spill into me just yet. I want to be in control. I am in control. I slow my movements to a slow stop. I watch as the tide in him ebb to a crawl. I wait to hear his breathing slow in anticipation to what is to come. He hasn't cum yet. I am in control. Never taking my eyes from his, I move my hands to grab is hair. I bring them down and forward to stroke his face, his neck, and his shoulders. My hands guided from memory down his shoulders to his chest. I lean into him and kiss him full on. Our eyes are still open as our tongues taste each other. I can feel his heart has returned to a normal pace and his breathing has slowed. I back out of his kiss and return my arms to his shoulders and back around his neck. I grab his hair at the same time I push hard to fill myself with him. We both catch our breaths as I pull his hair as my movements become more powerful and hard. I can feel the beast in me rising. I can feel her wanting to tear out of my body and devour him. He grabs my hips to pull me more over him. To ensure that he's getting all of his still hard cock into me. Up and down. Up and down. I am still in control. I am fucking him. I am in control. I decide when or if he cums. And I am ready for it. For him. For both of us. Never diverting my eyes from his, I continue to move on top of him. I feel my body tightening wanting to release my full power on him. Suddenly and still without sound I spill all over him. I feel him pour into me. Our juices mixing and covering each other's sex. Our bodies slow as we are now both exhausted and satisfied. I lay my head on his shoulder and listen to his breathing. His heart is still beating fast and his breathing is ragged. His hands are rubbing my back. I love the feeling of him still inside me after we have both climaxed. It fits perfectly inside me and cries for it when it's not. He kisses my shoulder and I lift my head to kiss his. One of his hands comes up to stroke my hair as I turn to face him. I wonder if he's going to ask what just happened. But he doesn't. When I finally look at his face, all I see is that beautiful smile. We kiss and that was how we ended that day.

By the end of the first week, we have consumed each other more times that you would think could be possible. We finally made it out to the lake. If you've never had sex in a canoe then you are truly missing out. The rocking of the boat from the water commanded the rhythm of our bodies. We actually took a lot of walks and talked. It was like a real relationship except we still weren't in the public eye. Eventually the food stock was getting low so I had to venture out to a market. I hated to leave him alone in the cabin. We couldn't risk anyone recognizing him.

This was a quaint town. It's surrounded by mountains as far as the eye can see. I know Robert would enjoy the sites the town has to offer. After loading up my cart, I head to the check out. There's only 2 people ahead of me so I'll be back in Roberts cocoon soon enough. I pick up a copy of a tabloid magazine. Flipping through the pages, I come across pictures of Henry and who I would assume to be his new girlfriend. I smile at the thought of him being with someone that hopefully allows him to get over me. I put the magazine up and move up in line as it's finally my turn.

"Kristine Sanders?"

I jump at the mention of my name. I turn around to see who it was. I think I'm going to faint. Smiling back at me is Alan and Jill. The last couple who's wedding we did before going on break. Normally I would be fine seeing one of my couples outside of the work place but not this one. Any couple but this one!

"Alan. Jill. Wow! What are you doing here?"

"We're on our honeymoon, silly."

"You just did our wedding a week ago."

They move to hug me. I'm still in a serious state of shock. Breathe, girl, breathe!

"I didn't know you were coming here for your honeymoon." Not that that was unusual. I rarely know where any of my couples are going as we don't provide that service. Mental note to self: Think about including a honeymoon package for your couples.

"There was a slight change in plans. Some kind of mess at the accounting firm so we had to delay our trip a few days and decided to come here instead of venturing too far away from home just in case."

"Ryan told us that you were in Georgia with your mom. What are you doing here?"

"Mom wanted to get away from Atlanta for a while so we got a cabin for a few days." I hoped that sounded more close to a truth than the blatant lie it really was.

"Oh. Okay. I can't wait to let Ryan know we ran into you. He said that he hadn't talked to you so I'll be sure to report that you are just fine."

"I'll give him a call, so don't worry about it." Will this damn cashier please hurry up with my groceries! Finally, I pay and turn to the potentially hazardous couple. "Enjoy the rest of your honeymoon."

Finally done checking out, I rush to the car and load up. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I honestly think I'm having a panic attack. Of all the places and of all the couples I could have worked for. The one I run into is the ones that work with Ryan. I'm so busted. Even worst, I'm going to have to break one of my own rules. I have to call Ryan while I'm away with Robert. Should I tell him? He's going to know something is wrong as soon as I get back to the cabin. He knows every expression my face makes. I drive out of the parking lot and head back to cabin. I would've called Ryan before I left the lot but my cell is buried in my travel bag. I finally make it back to the cabin. Robert is in the kitchen humming to a Phil Collins song when I come in. He comes over and wraps me in his arms. He spins me around once. Still humming he kisses me. I quickly kiss him back before moving out of his arms to empty mine of the grocery bags.

"I missed you. Did you find the store fine?"

I have to tell him now. I can't put this off.

"Uhm, yes, it was easy to find. Robert, I need to talk to you."

"Uh, hmm. I'm listening." Still wrapped up in the song and chopping fruit.

I move to turn off the music. I need his full attention. He turns to me still smiling when the music goes off. He sees my face and places the knife down.

"Kris, what's wrong?"

"At the market..." I can barely get it out. "At the market, I ran into a couple whose wedding we just did."

"That's all. I thought there was a serious problem."

"Robert, you don't understand. The couple works at the accounting firm." Crap! I forgot until just then, that I never told him that Ryan works at that firm. "With Ryan."

"What accounting firm?"

"The one that you and Henry decided not to get involved with."

Understanding slowly made its way across his face.

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"I didn't think it was necessary. You said that you weren't interested in them. So I didn't think it was information worth mentioning."

"Wait. I never told you which firm it was. How did you know which firm?"

Damn, his brain works fast. I'm going to have to come clean. Clean with most but not all of it.

"The night that you called to tell me about the surprise, if you remember, I was in the car with Ry... him when you called." I saw his face twitch when I attempted to say Ryan's name. "We were headed to a work party at the Crescent Hotel." Yep, the hits just keep coming. "It was there that I saw Henry. He was the two of us together. He was so mad. I feigned an illness to get out of there after a nasty confrontation with Henry. He came to the house to let me have it. He was so disappointed in me. We talked for hours to get it resolved. Then we were fine. I didn't think it was necessary to talk to you about it seeing how Henry and I had resolved it. Everything was fine."

"But everything is not fine. What if we had decided to go with that company? Would you have ever told me that your whatever he is worked there?"

"I don't know. Eventually, yes, I believe I would have said something."

"Kris, I don't like this. You and Henry keeping secrets from me. He never said a word. He just said that the firm wasn't right for us. I took him at his word. Now I see why it wasn't right for us. Well there's nothing we can do about it now and it's basically a moot point seeing how we didn't hire them. There's no harm done. So we can drop the subject."

"Robert, you don't understand. They intend on calling him to let him know where I am. I told him that I was in Georgia with my mom. They said that he has been concerned because he hadn't talked to me since I left. I have to call him so he doesn't come here looking for me. I have to tell him it's over. I need to do it today. I have to call him. But I need for you to be okay with that."

"If I'm not okay with it?" I can see the hurt in his face. I wanted to kiss it away. But I can't.

"I'm sorry. But it is for the best."

With that I walked to the bedroom to dig out my cell. I power it up and see that I still have a little power left. I walk from the room through the living room past Robert and out to the lake.

I dial Ryan's number. What am I going to say to him? This has to be done.

"Hello, stranger." He answered on the second ring.

"Hi." I couldn't bear to say his name.

"I've tried to call you several times but you never answered or return any of my texts. Where are you? Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. We decided to come to North Carolina for a quick getaway. I ran into Alan and Jill."

"Oh. I'm sure that was a surprise. I was hoping that you would call a few days ago. I was afraid that you didn't like your gift."

"That's one of the reasons I'm calling. Ryan, I can't accept your ring."

"I love you, Kris. Why don't you keep it and think some more on it."

"No. I have been thinking about this for a while. I enjoyed the times we spent together. But I know now that I am not in love with you. I know that I can never fall in love with you."

"You don't mean that. Don't look at as an engagement ring. Look at it as a promise to give us a chance."

"Ryan, you are not hearing me. There isn't an 'us'. I have to end things before you get hurt. I don't want to lie to you by making you think that there could possibly be more. There won't be. There can't be. I can't see you anymore."

"You don't mean it. Let's wait till you get home and we can discuss this then. I don't want you to make any rash decisions."

"I won't talk to you again after this call. I will send you the ring back. Don't call me or come to my house."

"I don't want the ring, Kristine. I got it for you. I want to be with you. You can't end things like this. Especially with you being hundreds of miles away. If you want to end things, then tell me to my face. Allow us to have a conversation about this. Don't end things like this, please!"

Every word, every plea, was heart wrenching to hear. I need to get this done. I hate hurting him like this but I need this to be over.

"Kris, I need to know one thing. Is there someone else?"

"I'm hanging up. Again, I'm sorry and I never want to see you again."

"Answer my question. Are you in love with someone else?"

"No."

With that final word I hung up the phone. I powered down the phone before sticking in into my sweater pocket. I pulled my sweater tighter around me as I looked over the water. I had to end it. I knew I wasn't in love with him. I didn't want to use him any more than I already had. How did I become this person? How did I allow myself to get caught up in this whole mess? A few minutes passed before I heard footsteps coming up behind me. He came to stand next to me. He didn't attempt to touch me. He just stood there to let me know that he was there for me. I leaned into him and he wrapped one arm around my waist.

"Are you sure that ending things with him is what you really want?"

"Yes. I can't be who he wants me to be."

"Did you give him up because of me?"

"No. Yes. No. I don't know what I mean. No, I gave him up because I can't love him. I can't be his wife. I can't give him the future he wants. Yes, partially, because of you. You forced me to dig within myself to finally see the truth. I don't love him. I know I could never love him. I don't know if I can even really love someone."

"Come inside. The sun is going down and it's starting to get cool out here."

He slides his hand from my waist and grabbed hold of my hand. I turned to him and saw sadness in his eyes. I reached up and stroked my hand along his chin and gave him my I'm okay smile. He returns it and kisses me on my forehead.

# Chapter 14

# What now...

Our two week vacation was quickly coming to a close. After I had called Ryan and ended things with him the rest of that evening was a bit strained. We barely talked during dinner. When it came time to go to bed, Robert waited and came to bed after I had already showered and had lain down for the night. I felt him crawl into bed. I rolled over to face him. He kissed me on my forehead before rolling onto his opposite side where he stayed for the remainder of the night. The next morning he was up before I was. I didn't know what to expect when I finally decided to get dressed for breakfast. I walked into the kitchen but he wasn't there. I checked the living room and den, but he was not to be found. I finally looked out and found him sitting in one of the deck chairs. I put on my lined boots, sucked up some courage, and opened the door. He didn't turn to see me come out but I know he heard me coming towards him.

I sat on the lounge part of the chair and took his hand.

"Are you upset with me for calling him?"

"How can I be upset with you for something I caused?"

"Something you caused? You had nothing to do with why I ended things with him. Just like I had nothing to do with why you ended things with your girlfriends."

"But if being with me keeps you from finding love, from being happy with someone then it is my fault."

"Oh my goodness. That's what you really think? Robert, no! What we have has nothing to do what my decision. I never saw myself being with him for always. Not once did I even imagine it. Not even in a day dream. Nothing. I've never been one of those girls that dream of having a wedding day. I enjoy planning them for other people. I have loved before or at least I thought it was love but turned out it was desire. I love my dog. I love our times together. I love the exhilaration of what we do to each other. I love the feeling I get when you look at me with desire. I love seeing others happy on their big day. I love my mom and sister. I love my friends. I love my life. I just haven't found the person I can say, Yes, I am in love with."

"But you could've had it with him if I wasn't in the way."

"No, I couldn't. I was with him just about every day and at no time did my heart ever go pitter patter thinking of him. Even when you weren't on the same continent as me, my feelings for him never increased. Now enough with this woe is me attitude and don't ruin yet another vacation for me. Besides you're the one that should be mad at me."

"Mad at you? Why?"

"For breaking one of our rules. I called and talked about him while I am with you. I even told him where I really was. Not who I was with of course. I allowed an outside relationship to mess with part of our trip. So I deserve any form of punishment you deem appropriate."

"Kristine, I'm being serious. I don't want you to give up a chance of being happy with someone because of me."

"I am happy. Don't ever doubt that. Sure we've had our ups and downs but I am happy. Have you given someone up because of me?"

"No. I haven't. I just want to make sure that you are still okay with your decision."

"I am okay with my decision. I am perfectly okay with my decision. I am perfectly okay with our decision also. I will let you know if that ever changes. I promise."

After what seemed like an eternity, he finally took me into his arms. Our lips met with a fevering passion that made me ready for him instantly. Our hands were on several places on each other bodies that I don't even remember who undressed who. Before I knew it we were both sky clad, naked to the outside world.

"I seem to remember you said something about punishment." He said looking down at me as I lay displayed out on the lounge chair. "Stay here. Don't you dare move."

He went into the cabin as I laid there naked as a jay bird. I have no idea what I've gotten myself into but I'm excitedly anxious to find out. He came back carrying items in a plastic bag. He removed a blind fold and proceeded to cover my eyes. I heard something else being removed from the bag. He used it to bind my wrist together in front of me. Raising my arms above my head he ties the other end to the top of the chair, securing me in place. I feel his hand slid down my arms. He stops to kiss me full on and immediately stops leaving me panting for more. He kisses me down my neck to that sweet spot that he loves so well before making his way to my breast. I feel him massaging them with his hands before he begins to suck on my nipples. He takes one between his teeth and bits down first gently before applying more pressure. I moan in pleasure. He moves over to the other nipple and does the same thing. How I love what he does to me. He takes his fingers and strokes down my stomach and kisses me in that soft spot just below my navel but above my sex. I arch upwards to let him know I want him to go lower. He stops but not before taking his fingers and thumping my clit. I hear something else being removed from the bag. He's back to massaging and kissing my nipples soon his tongue is replaced by what I will assume are nipple clamps. He allows them to close fast and hard on my nipples. Usually he's very gentle with them but today he's more about the fun and pain than the sensuality. This is perfectly fine with me. He releases the catch on the back of the chair dropping me to lay completely flat. The quick drop make the clips jump and pinch my nipples a bit more.

"You said that you deserved whatever punishment I deemed necessary, right?"

I could hear the menacing in his voice. If only he knew how much this was turning me on. I could only moan in response to his answer. He begins to kiss me again. Our tongues doing that special dance. I feel his hand move across my stomach before he reaches up and squeezes one of the nipple clips. It hurts so well. Still kissing me wide and hard he continues to squeeze harder until I scream out in pain. But I don't want him to stop. I want him to hurt me. I deserve to be hurt for all the pain I have caused both him and Ryan. He returns to kissing me and repeats the process on my other nipple. I try to hold off screaming a while longer knowing that if I do scream he'll stop kissing me. I continue till I can't take it anymore and screamed out loud. I can hear him chuckle softly. He trails his hand down my chest, down my stomach before slowly, seductively, expertly sliding one finger into my moist pussy. I began to move again his hand. I want him so bad. He then enters a second finger and using his thumb to put pressure on my clit, he begins to finger fuck me. I am so hot for him I don't know if I can wait for his cock. I rock my hips against his hand. Urging his fingers deeper into me. I want to tell him to enter me but this is my punishment and I won't take that away from him. I feel him move and before long his fingers are replaced with his tongue in my sex. He's so damn good at this. I can feel that I'm about to cum and he hears it in the sounds that are coming from me. Again he stops. I hear him with that damn plastic bag again. I don't know what it could be but I want him to stop with that damn bag and fuck me already. He flicks the nipple clips and squeezes them not as hard as before. My nipples are already very sensitive that it doesn't take much for me to let him know just how much he's hurting me. I feel something trailing down the side of my face, my neck, between my breasts. It's moving down my stomach and then I feel something cold and hard against my clit. I don't know what it is.

"Are you sure you deserve to be punished?" He asks me again.

I nod my head wanting, waiting for him to continue. I hear the catch release and feel my legs drop to allow my feet to rest on the ground. I feel him standing in front of me. Using his knees he forces my legs open. Again he inserts two fingers into me. I'm so close to the edge. He feels me tightening around him so he removes his fingers again and kneels before me and begins licking my lower lips. I'm moaning so loud I'm going hoarse. Just as I'm about to finally release he removes his tongue from me and then I feel a pain I've never felt before. He'd been holding another clip. He has pinched it to my clit. He begins squeezing on it with one hand while his tongue resumes licking me. I have never cum so hard. I can feel the tears as they roll down the side of my face. He doesn't stop. He continues squeezing the clamp on my now hypersensitive clit and laps up the juices that's pouring out me. He stops and lifts my legs into the air so that I'm in the perfect position for him to ram his hard cock into me. I scream again. He is fucking me hard and fast. I can't catch my breath. He hasn't removed the clip so the pain never quits. I can feel him tensing so I know he's about to cum.

"Cum for me again. Harder!"

He's righteously fucking me. Between the clip and him, I cum again harder than before. I can't even scream to let him know. No sound is escaping my mouth. Soon I feel his hot juices fill me as he finally crests. He removes all of the clips and comes to lie on top of me. I'm still bound but he removes the blindfold. He kisses away my tears before laying his head on my chest. We are both exhausted. This was the best punishment I have ever had.

"Are you okay? Did I hurt you too much?" It came out in a whisper.

"You never hurt me too much. Am I now forgiven?"

"Always... let me untie you."

He finally releases my wrists. They'll probably be a bit bruised from the way I was pulling at them. I look at my breasts. I can see impressions from the ridges of the rubber tips on the clips. I touch one and know they are going to be sensitive for a while. I didn't even bother to touch my clit. Holding my hand he helps me from the chair. My legs are bit wobbly so he holds me up to escort me to the bathroom. He places me into tub before he turn on the water. It slowly fills the tub and swaddles me. I watch as he pours some lavender into the water. After setting down the bottle he turns the water off. He leans me forward and slowly enters the tub positioning himself behind me. I fall against his back as his arms come to press me close to him. We stayed like that for a long time. The scent relaxes me. I feel his lips on the top of my head.

"I wish we could stay like this longer." I tell him.

"As do I." He responds.

"You sure do know how to surprise a girl. Using the clip on me was..."

"Too much?" He sounded worried.

"No, it was intense. It was exciting and intoxicating."

"I might do it again if you liked it so much."

"Let's wait till our next trip. I don't think I'll be able to walk if we do that too often."

"I'm sure we can come up with something to do during the 4 days we have left."

I turn to kiss him slowly. Letting him know that I was ready to go again but this time let's take it slow.

Sunday eventually came and we had to say goodbye to our cabin. It was a hard ride to the airport and the plane trip home was even worst. We hadn't been able to settle on a next meet date so we decided to play it by ear. We kissed with a wanton desire before I descended the plane and got into my car for my drive home. Marcus was waiting for us at the airport.

Shep missed me and proved that to me by jumping me as soon as I hit the door. I look around and my house is spotless. My fridge has been restocked and I see what looks like a few new dog toys in Shep's bin. I guess I wasn't the only one spoiled these last two weeks. I take my bags into the laundry room and separate them into wash piles. As I'm empting them, I come across the little black satin bag. I'm tempted to look at the ring again. But I don't. I carry it into my home office and drop it into a mailing envelope. I fill out the address and place it with my laptop so that I remember to take it to work tomorrow to be sent out with the rest of the mail. I charge my phone and check my voicemail. I find my stack of mail on the kitchen counter as I go into the kitchen to check the answer machine. Absentmindedly I'm half listening to the messages. All I can think about is this Robert and our trip. It was nearly perfect. I couldn't help smiling remembering the clips when I'm drawn back to reality by a voice I didn't want to hear.

"Kris. I know you said not to contact you but I have to try again. I see now that buying you that ring was stupid. I was trying to push you into saying something that apparently you weren't ready for. I'm sorry. Please call me back when you get home."

This was followed by four more just like it. I didn't even listen to them. I just deleted them as soon as his voice came on. I'm not calling him back, the ring will be in the mail tomorrow and all of this will be over. I ended the day with a nice pasta salad and great classic movie and memories of Robert.

7am came too soon. I wake and complete my morning routine before hitting I-75 south to work. Everyone looks well rested. A few were tanned. Steven even commented that I had a glow about me. They know not to ask me about my trips because I'd never tell them. The day and the next four passed uneventfully and in an exotic haze. Our first weekend, back we only had one wedding and an engagement party. Since, it was a slow weekend there wasn't a need for me to be there. So I went home and crashed.

I checked my email. There was one from Henry. He talked to me about his new girlfriend. He sounds really happy which in turn make me very happy. I reply to him and continue checking my messages. There's one from Robert. That man truly has a dirty mind. He details all the things that he either has ever done to me or wants to do to me. All of it sounds tempting and makes my pussy throb a bit. The rest were work related so I power it down and took Shephard for a walk.

When we got back there was a package on my door step. I saw the postmarks and a smile came across my face. We walked inside. I unleashed Shep and went to open the package. Inside were a set of keys and a packet of paperwork. I was confused until I realized what was going on. He had bought us the cabin in North Carolina. It was in my name solely but still he had bought the cabin. What a romantic. I went to get my phone but there was a knock at the door. I go to answer it. It was a delivery man holding a bouquet of white roses. I thought it was weird. I don't like roses but hey Robert can't be right all of the time. I tip the guy and put them on the table. I picked back up my phone and called the direct line I have for Robert. He answers right away. I didn't even think of the time. I was only thinking of him.

"You bought the cabin?"

"Well that place holds so many good moments for us so I figure it was worth a repeat visit whenever we wanted to go."

"Oh and thanks for the flowers also. But you know I don't like roses."

"I didn't send you flowers. I wish I had thought to do so. Did you check the card?"

"No I just assumed they were from you."

"No... they are from me."

I turned around so fast I almost dropped my phone. Standing there in my entry way was Ryan.

"What are you doing in my house? Get the fuck out!" I yelled at him. I could hear Robert yelling my name into the phone. I lift it to my ear. I tell him it's Ryan and that I'll call him back. I hung up with him yelling a string of profanity in Flemish. My phone rings right back but I don't answer it.

"I thought you said there wasn't someone else." He looks hurt and angry at the same time.

"He's just a friend. You don't belong here. I told you we were over. Get out and take your flowers with you."

"So he's the one you are in love with? That's why you wouldn't commit to me. You are already committed to someone else?" He says this as he's stepping closer to me. I back up and run into the back of the couch. Shep being use to Ryan doesn't help me at all.

"No it's not like that. You have it wrong. I'm not in love with anyone. Again leave my house or I'll have to call the police."

My phone rings again. When I don't answer, my house phone rings. I pray that it's someone else.

"Kristine. Answer your phone! I don't like this, answer your phone!" Yells Robert's voice from the answer machine.

"So that's him? Sounds foreign. What I wasn't exotic enough for you. You had to have something more European? Who is he?"

The house phone rings again. Ryan gets to it before I could and at the same time the answer machine picks up.

"Who the fuck is this?!" Ryan yells into the receiver.

"Don't worry about who I am. Just know that I know who you are, Ryan Matthews. And if I were you, I'd leave that house right now. You don't want to see me when I get mad."

I was taken back when Robert said Ryan's last name. I know I never told him. What's that matter now?

"Don't threaten me, Mr. Whoever you are. I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend and you are getting in the way. I'll leave when I'm done."

"Mr. Matthews, you are done. Kitten, I know you can hear me. I'll be there soon the police is already on the way." With that the line went dead.

I know he said his pet name for me only to anger Ryan.

"So he calls you Kitten. Have you had sex with him? Does he make you feel as good as I do? Why did you lie and say there wasn't anyone else?"

"I didn't mean to lead you on. I didn't even realize I was until I saw that ring. You know me better than that."

"Actually I don't know you at all. You didn't answer my question. Are you having sex with him?" He's right back in my face as he's yelling this.

"That's none of your business!" He grabs my arms before I have chance to get away.

"Answer the question!" He screams into my face as he's shaking me.

"You wanna know the truth? Yes I've fucked him. He's fucked me harder and better than anyone I've ever met. He does things to me that you would be embarrassed to hear." I was spewing venom and it felt so good to get it out. He wants to come into my house and act a fool this is what he gets. "He likes to tie me up and spank me with all kinds of things. He likes the pain and so do I. You could never hold a candle to him. He makes me cum so hard I scream. You asked for the truth well there it is. You were just someone to play with when he wasn't here. I could never love someone as weak and pathetic as you. A woman turns you down and you come into her home begging for her to take you back. Look at you. I need a man and you, Ryan Matthews are not it. If I were you I'd leave before the police arrive. You have child a think about. And if you want to feel the wrath of my man you'd think twice about ever coming near me again."

"I finally get to see the real you. Thanks for showing me what a disgusting bitch you are before I got in too deep. I wish I had never met you. You are nothing more than a filthy whore!" He spits in my face.

He pushed me back onto the couch before making his way out the door into his car and half way down the street before the police arrived. I slid down to the floor and cried. I don't know if it was adrenaline or fear that made me say all of that. I have no more strength to fight. An officer came into the open door and saw me on the floor. She asked if I needed paramedics I told her no. It was just my pride that was hurt. I gave her a semi-full statement. I told her a complete lie about the description of the guy. I said that I didn't know who he was or why he attacked me. When asked who it was that called the report in, I told her I was the phone with a friend when the attack happened. I told her he was probably here to rob my home seeing how I just got home from a two week vacation and was surprised to see me home. Man, I'm good at lying. I wonder why. I had already hurt Ryan enough and the last thing I wanted was for him to lose his son over me. After double checking to make sure I was okay they finally cleared out. I grabbed my cell which has been ringing nonstop for the past hour.

"Kristine, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. He's gone and the police just left."

"I'm at the airport but there's a storm and I can't get out. Did he hurt you? Please, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. No bruises. It's not necessary for you to come. Stay home. I appreciate what you did. Calling the police for me." Again I lied. I did have bruises on my arms where he grabbed me but they'll be gone before he sees me again. "I'm really tired and I'm sure you have work to do."

"I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person. But if you say you are fine, then I'll have to trust in that. Did they arrest him?"

Here we go. "No. They didn't arrest him. I got him out of here before they arrived. I didn't want him to get arrested because of me. He's lost so much already. It's my fault his company didn't get the contract with you. It's my fault that his heart is in pieces. It's my fault he's not thinking clear. But mainly I didn't want it to be my fault if he loses his son." I had to say it all like that so that he didn't flare up and not let me talk.

"I see. I understand. You are easy to forgive those of us even when we don't deserve it."

Wow that was easy. "By the way how did you know Ryan's last name? I know I never said it."

"I had Marcus check into him after we got back. Once I saw him I had to. Please don't be mad. I was only looking out for you."

"I'm not mad, just tired. I need to get some sleep."

"I'll call you in a few hours to check on you. Goodnight. Sleep well."

"Bye."

I wish I could've slept well. I showered and lay in my bed all night. Every time I closed my eyes, I kept seeing Ryan there. Squeezing my arms and telling me how worthless I am. I watch the anger turn to disgust on his face when I told him about me and Robert. It was like he was seeing a whole new person. Like I was someone that he needed to get away from running and screaming. Thank goodness tomorrow is Sunday.

# Chapter 15

# Don't you just love surprises...?

Robert and I have planned to get together after Halloween. He couldn't believe how busy we are getting this time of year. People love a themed wedding or some just love the colors of fall. He's called or emailed me every day since the incident. Marcia wasn't told the whole story. She just saw it as an opportunity to try to set me up with someone else. I finally got her to stop when I told her that I would tell her husband about what happened during a certain trip we took. Let's just say the girl should never be left alone for even a pee break if she has been drinking. Once Henry heard about the incident first he was mad at me for not saying anything to him about it. Then he became furious again at me for not pressing charges. He finally calmed down after three weeks of ignoring his calls and messages. If it's not one Winters I'm not talking to it's another.

I haven't heard anything else from Ryan. I'm happy about that. The police did a follow up to see what else I could remember but of course they didn't get any new information. My physical bruises have healed but the emotional ones will take a little bit longer.

I threw myself deep into my work. Keeping my eyes open for new styles and trends. We even tested out a few new caterers and photographers. Thank goodness there are always people getting married. We've opened up to do more regular parties, birthdays, even baby showers.

When November finally arrived, I barely noticed. The day that Robert is to arrive, I'm always more hyper. My staff says that I become intolerable. Too happy too everything, too much to be around. If only they knew what my week will consist of.

Its Thanksgiving weekend. I had make excuses to my mom as to why I couldn't make it home. She had started seeing a new man so she seemed happy to celebrate their first holiday together. I decided that since this was also Robert's first Thanksgiving that I would cook an entire dinner for us. I even made a sweet potato pie. Miracle of all miracles I didn't burn it. I was taking the turkey out of the oven when I heard my front door open. He's here! I went to greet him.

"Yummy, something smells really good in here."

"Mom!?"

Oh my goodness, what was going on? She isn't supposed to be here.

"Well, I haven't seen you in over a year. Whenever I mention either you coming to visit or me coming up, you always have an excuse. So we decided that that we weren't going to ask. So here we are."

"Mom, I wished that you had called. Wait. You said we. Who is 'we'?"

"Oh, your sister, silly. They're getting stuff out of the car."

Full blown panic alert. My mom, sister, and no doubt the kids and her husband are all here. There's no way I can get rid of them and definitely no time to get Robert to turn around. What am I going to do?

Mom makes her way to the kitchen. She knows I'm not the one for cooking so I know her spider senses are working overtime. I watch her lift the lids and sample each dish as my sister and her brood pile into my house carrying bags of groceries and dare I even say it, clothes for what seems like a few days stay. Before mom or Gina can ask any questions I run upstairs and quickly remove any sex toys from the spare bedroom. I will already have enough things to explain and that those I think a psychiatrist will have to be involved. Before leaving my bedroom I grab the phone off the bedside table and punch in Robert's number.

"Please answer, please answer." I repeat with every passing ring.

"Can't wait to see me?" He answers.

"No I can't but we have trouble." I calmly tell him the situation and tell him that I'll understand if he wants to turn around and go home. I even ask him to get a hotel room and maybe we can meet up. But I can't guarantee it.

"This does present an unexpected problem but we'll work it out. See you in a bit." He hung up before I could ask what he meant.

"Kris, I think the turkey's ready. I'll take it out so it doesn't burn." Mom yells up to me.

I double check the rooms before coming back down. I hug my nephew and nieces who have decided to take Shep through his paces outside. That dog has no idea what he's in for. My sister is different from me. Where I'm a bit more adventurist she's comfortable staying home and being a mom. He husband, Duane, is an ad exec for a major firm in Atlanta. He's very creative. He's a sports fanatic and a great dad and husband. I'm so happy Gina found someone that makes her happy and loves her despite our mother.

"I hope you weren't cooking all of this food just for you."

My mom ever the inquisitor.

"I...uhm...no, uhm..." She's the one person no matter how old I get I could never lie to face to face.

"Well spit it out, Girl. You have someone coming over? Someone you are embarrassed to tell your momma about?"

"It's not like that. He's just special and very private."

"Private? Does that mean he's married? Or, is he ashamed to be seen with you?"

This woman doesn't hold back does she?

"No, neither of those reasons are correct. He isn't like any of the other guys I've ever been in a relationship with."

"Well I wouldn't know anything about that seeing how you never bring them to visit me. Gina! Let's start cooking the food we brought. Since your sister was only expecting her new boyfriend there isn't for all of us."

"If I had known you were coming... and he's not... oh forget it."

"Mom, you told me she was expecting us. Sorry, Sissy, if I had known that mom was up to her tricks I would have put a stop to it. So new boyfriend huh? Details, details, give them to us."

I went to sit at the dining room table and just lowered my head. This is going to be a long day. While they clanked pots together and added to the pots to increase the portion sizes I tried to answer as many of their probing questions as possible. I didn't want to give them too much information than necessary. I also didn't want to get caught in a lie so I gave them just enough to satisfy them, hopefully. About 20 minutes later, I felt a knot grow in my stomach when I heard the sound of a car pulling into my garage. Like that wasn't going to start at new round of questions. For example, why does he have a garage door opener? Does he stay here a lot? Then I forgot to tell them about Marcus. This day just keeps on getting better.

"Kitten, I'm home." He bellowed out all sing song like.

"Robert, we are in the kitchen."

Marcus walks in first carrying the bags. He gives me the customary smile and nod before Robert walks in carrying three bouquets of flowers. He's really putting on a show. Gina and mom accept the flowers as they introduce themselves. After putting them in water, Gina returns to the cooking while mom comes to the table and sits. I know what she's about to do and I'm so not happy about it. Roberts gives me my bouquet and kisses me on the lips in front of my mom. I gently push him away and see a mischievous smirk on his face. He's eating all of this up. Such a bad boy. He's getting the spanking tonight. I replace the flowers in the vase on the table then return to the table where Robert has already seated himself next to where I was sitting before. He takes my hand and kisses it before laying our entwined hands on top of the table. He's is in so much trouble.

"It's great to finally meet you, Mrs. Sanders. I've heard so much about you."

"Ginny, if you please. Well we've heard nothing about you, Mr. Winters. So how long have you and Kris been dating?" Eyeing Robert's shows of affection suspiciously.

"Robert, if you please. We've been seeing each other for a while. You have a wonderful daughter."

"How long is a while? Yes she is a wonder. Are you married?"

"MOM!!"

"No, Ginny, I am not married and it's been just over two years. Off and on but still two years."

"I see. Two years, not married, and you have a garage door opener. So why the secrecy? Why is this the first time I'm hearing about you?"

"We are still getting to know each other. I live far away and sometimes it makes it hard to do that. But I think we are in a good place now. What do you think?" He looks down at me smiling that smile that he knows I will melt over. But I'm not falling for it.

"We still have a few kinks to work out but all in all it's going pretty okay."

"So tell me about yourself, Robert. Starting with where you live and what do you do for a living."

"Mom, that's enough."

"It's fine. I live in Belgium. I own my own business with my brother. It keeps me traveling a lot."

"Hmm. I see. Belgium." She's nodding as she says this taking it all in.

"Mom, I think you've grilled Robert enough for the day. Let's go finish dinner. I'm sure Gina needs my help."

"Oh, who's the fella that came in with you? A bodyguard or something?"

Shit I forgot all about Marcus. I'm so use to not realizing he's here.

"Yes, he's my guard. I deal with a lot of different people and you never know when Marcus may be needed." God, please let that be the end of the questions.

She seemed to accept that for now. But I know my mom, she's only just begun. I followed Robert into the living room where Marcus and Duane were watching a football game. Jumping and yelling at the refs on TV like they could hear them. I knew I was only going to be in the way in the kitchen so I didn't even try to get stuck in there besides, I didn't want to get cornered by mom before I had a chance to talk to Robert alone. I left the living room to sit in the den. Robert was right behind me. He came to me and wrapped me in his arms. I laid my head upon his chest. I wanted to stay there hidden from mom. He kissed me on the top of my head before I lifted my head to look into his eyes.

"I swear I didn't know they were coming. I don't know when or if she will recognize you or even if I can trust her to keep our secret once she does."

"We'll have to deal with that when the time comes. Sure this isn't exactly the way I thought this week would go so we'll just have to make it work."

"You don't understand. Mom isn't one for keeping her mouth shut. Why do you think I live so far away from her? Not just that, but never introduce anyone I've ever dated to her. She knows no boundaries. Anything she wants to know, she'll question to death and not just that, she's a social media junkie. The only thing I can think to do is give her as little information about you as possible and above all don't let her take a picture of you. It will be on the net faster than it takes you to say no."

"I'm sure she's only looking out for your best interest. Sure it's not what I expected to happen this week but as long as I get to spend some time with you than I am a happy man."

With that we stood back up and rejoined the rest of the family. We all joined in for a delicious feast and conversation. I kept moving mom away from asking Robert too many personal questions. She did get in a few jibes though. She's relentless is not kept on a leash.

It started to get awkward come bedtime. It's my house but knowing that my mom was only a few doors down from me, made me feel like a little girl sneaking a boy into her room after curfew.

Robert held my hand as he led me to our room sensing my nervousness. I made sure to lock the door. I know she wouldn't dare come into the room but I locked it either way. Why am I so scared? We've had sex before. Even out in the open. Mom shows up and it's like it's the first time.

Robert wraps his arms around my waist and slowly kiss me. I love kissing him. I soon forget all of the problems that rest on the other side of the bedroom door. He guides me into the bathroom and turns on the water in the shower. I allow him to first undress me before undressing himself. I step into his grace and began kissing him again. We enter the shower and allow the water to wash away stress and nervousness. I miss being with him. Even if all we do tonight is kiss I will be perfectly happy.

"This shower isn't suited for what I want to do but I wanted you to relax."

"Thank you. My world had been sideways the past few months and I was looking forward to this break to get my head together. But look at what happened. My family's here. Marcus is too big for the couch. I'm sure there will be another parade of questions tomorrow but tonight all I want to lie in your arms and escape all of this."

We stood in the shower for a long time just holding each other. Eventually the water began to turn cold so we had to retreat into the bedroom. I sat on the bed wrapped in my towel. Robert came to kneel in front of me. Taking each hand into his, he kissed my fingers. Then he kissed the inside of each wrist. Moving up to the inside of my elbow. Up my arm to my shoulder. I turned my face to him and kissed the tip of his nose. I smile at him. I smile at just the thought of him. He untucks my towel allowing it to fall to my side. He kisses each nipple before coming back and kissing my lips. I stroke the side of his face as I return his kisses. I can feel him gently pushing me to lay back onto the bed. He hovers over me still kissing me. Slowly he begins kissing down my body. Again, kissing each nipple. He continues down stopping at my knees. He lowers himself to kneel again. He turns to kiss the inside of my thigh as he raises first one of my legs and then the other to rest of either of his shoulders.

"Do you promise you can keep quiet?" He whispers to me.

"If I can't?"

"Then you will have to be punished and I don't think you will want our house guests to know about that."

"I promise."

With that he first flick the tiniest of licks on my clit. Then I feel first one finger sliding up and down the outer lips of my opening. Then he begins playing with me with two. Every so often sticks those two fingers in as he kisses the inside of my thighs. Suddenly I feel his thumb sliding lower. First he uses it to feel the ridge of my anal opening. Applying just a little pressure I feel his thumb enter me. I had never had anal before and was shocked at how quick I went from shocked to aroused. Keeping his thumb in my ass, he reenters those two fingers into my pussy as he begins to lick my clit. I'm trying hard to keep quiet. I grab by pillow and place it over my mouth. The new feeling of his thumb and his excellent skill at oral is overtaking any sense of decorum I may have had. Using my legs I pull his face closer into me. I feel his teeth bite hard and I stifle a scream of passion. He holds on to me as he continues to finger me. Keeping his teeth in place, he removes his two fingers and insert them into my anus. He's slowly decreasing the pressure of his bite as I struggle to keep from cumming. I can feel him loosing me up. I know what he wants to do and I can't believe it but I want him to fuck me in my ass. He stands up and swiftly inserts his ready cock into my pussy. Getting it all wet with the juices that he has been bringing forward. I wrap my legs around him as he stands there and is slowly moving his dick in and out of me.

"I promise I will try to be quiet."

"You had better. I'm finally going to claim your ass."

With that he removes his now wet cock from me and goes to the side table where I keep all of our toys and removes a bottle of gel and a butt plug.

"I will go easy to start off. Let me know if it gets to be too much."

I nodded. I didn't want him to hear the fear in my voice. First he apply a generous amount of gel to me. Both inside and out. Then rubs some on the plug. I'm still on my back with him standing in front of me. He raises my legs to place my feet at his shoulders. Using his fingers he again awakens the nerve endings at my core. Both holes are quickly ready for him. I feel the plug slowly enter me just a part of the way. He leaves it there as he continues to use his fingers to massage me pussy. He kisses my ankle before slowly pushing it further into me. My breath catch as I feel a slight tear. He begins to back it out.

"Don't! I want you to continue. I want this."

"Are you sure?"

"Please." Weakly I answered but it was enough for him not to stop.

He leans forward on my legs as he again slowly guides the plug into me. I can feel the tears falling down my face. I have never been in so much pain in my life. Finally he has the plug in place. I quickly wipe my tears away and concentrate on the fingers that are now playing with my pussy. He uses his other hand to gently twist the plug. Widening my opening for him. Slowly he begins to pull the plug out then pushes it back in. Just a taste of that small piece of emptiness made me want it back in completely. He makes a few more passes before he finally pulls the plug completely out. Removing his fingers from my pussy, I'm left wanting and ready for him to be everywhere. Anywhere. I just want Robert. Slowly he inserts just the head of his penis into my awaiting asshole. The initial pain from the plug was nothing compared to this. Slowly it begins to stop hurting and starts to mix with another more familiar feeling. A feeling of sexual arousal and want that only he can bring upon me. Eventually his full shaft is inside of me and I can see the intensity of the new pressure is making him lose his concentration. I can see that he wants to come but wants to make last so I can cum also. He grabs both of my ankles. That only forced out a silent grunt. I clinched my teeth as he increased the speed, as he breathed heavily along the sides of my legs. I move my fingers to stimulate my clit as he's fucking me. It's a pleasure I never knew I wanted. I never knew that I need. But now that I have it. I can't imagine not feeling this again. I have to stifle a scream of exotic pleasure as I cum hard. I see on Roberts face that he's about to blow. Eventually, I feel the moment when he finally cums. The hot stickiness of him flows into me stinging the little rips I knew were on the inside of me. Slowly I felt him soften as he exits me. Gently he pulled out. Every movement hurt like hell. I pulled my covers over me and allowed the pain to wash over me.

"Kristine. Are you okay?"

He had come to sit near me on the bed. He hadn't removed the covers from my head. I remained silent. I don't want to move or talk. I was too busy still feeling everything. I feel him shape his body around mine and drape his arm around me.

When I open my eyes again it was barely morning. I struggle to move my legs and make my way to bathroom. Robert is still asleep so I'm careful not to wake him. I turn on the shower and allowed the water to wash over me. I hear the door open then softly close. He opens the door to the shower and steps in. He stands behind me and holds me tight to him. I lean into him.

"Are you mad at me?"

"No. Of course not. I'm just stressed and I worry about what will happen with my mom."

"It will be fine. Did you enjoy last night? I wanted to try something new with you."

"It was different. I don't think I would enjoy it. But I did. I kinda scares me that I liked it so much. But right now I hurt like hell so let's not do it again soon."

With that he kissed the nape of my neck.

"Let me wash you."

He lathered my body sponge and gently washed every part of me thoroughly. He was extremely careful not to apply too much pressure to my butt. We went back into the bedroom. He put on a robe and went downstairs to get me a glass of water. I wanted some aspirin and more sleep. I took the pills and sat the glass on the night stand.

We laid next to each other in the bed and gently he stroked the side of my hips. Easily he guided me to lie on my back and spread my legs. Softly he began stroking my vagina awake with his hand. I enjoyed his fingers masturbating me as we laid there and kissed the rest of the morning away.

When we finally dressed and went downstairs, most everyone was already up. Robert and I sat in the single chair together with me curled up on his lap. I didn't care anymore that mom was there. She and Gina were in the kitchen cooking breakfast. Marcus was out taking Shep for a walk. She calls me into the kitchen. I sat in a chair at the table knowing that I would only be in her way if I tried to help her cook. She finishes plating the food and brings a huge stack of pancakes to the table before sitting across from me. I squared my shoulders waiting for the assault that I knew was coming.

"Kris, I don't know what the deal is with the two of you but I don't like that you hid this from me."

"Mom, I'm not going to discuss this with you."

"Fine. Then you will just listen as I discuss this. I know who he is. I also think that you are in over your head and will get hurt in the end. And this will end. There can't be a future for the two of you. I don't know what kind of lies he's been telling you that's keeping you with him but he's seeing another woman. I've seen the pictures of the two of them."

"Mom, stop! I know all about what is going on. Things are not black and white with us. I know what I'm getting into and trust me I don't have blinders on when it comes to my relationship. So what he's got other women. I always know when there's another woman. I don't care. It's none of your business. You can't just show up in my house and try to dictate what is going on inside of it."

"That's not what Mommy is trying to do, Krissy. We're just concerned about you."

"I appreciate the concern, Gina. But I don't like the suspicion you two have about my life. Robert and I have an understanding that has been working for us for two years now. How long it will go on? I don't know. Right now it's fun. It's exciting. It's not without its faults. But we work them out. Just trust me. I know what I'm doing. He's really a good guy. Just give him a chance. Also, I also need for you to keep this relationship a secret. Don't ask why just know that if either of you open your mouth, it will be you hurting me not him."

"I don't like this. You are my daughter and I only want to see you finally settle down with someone and be happy. But if this is what will make you happy, then I will do what you ask."

I smile and call everyone into the kitchen to eat. They finally left Robert and me to ourselves the next day. We didn't waste a moment getting into our normal rhythm. After an exhausting afternoon we laid in bed talking. The rest of week went by too fast. We talked a lot and watched a few movies. He even feigned an interest in wedding planning when I got an email from a client. This is the Robert I liked. This is the Robert that I always want to keep around. We made plans to see each other at New Years in Paris.
