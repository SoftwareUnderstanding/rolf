Scene one Ext Day:

The date is 1553. East Anglia, England. Fires are burning in a small village and smoke rises from the chimney's of small thatched cottages. It is spring and in the fields crops are being cared for. A woman comes from her small house and looks at an empty blanket on the ground. She takes a sharp breath and runs into the centre of the village before screaming loudly.

Woman

No! My child, someone has taken my baby...

The workers in the fields hear the sound of her cries and put down the tools they work with and run to her.

Scene 2. Ext Day

We see a man nailing a proclamation to a tree. It reads.

Concerning Missing Children

Â£100. Reward

For Information received

By order EdwardV1

Scene 3 Ext Night

A group of men are searching a thick forest by torch light, they hunch down after coming across a cave from which a light could be seen. They whisper and withdraw their swords.

Scene 4 Int Night

Inside the cave a fire burns under a steaming caldron. The shadow of a woman is thrown against the stone walls and we see a earth floor scattered with human bones small serpents crawl between the sculls and pelvic bones that have been dried and left.

A slight click is heard and the shadow freezes. Then the group of armed men storm the cave. They rush forwards, their shadows grab the woman and we see the face of one of the men. He holds his hand to his mouth and lets out a horrified gasp.

Scene 5 Kenninghall House Day

June 1553

We find ourselves in a splendid Tudor, double fronted house, situated on a huge East Anglian estate. It is a cool bright day and sun streams into the garden that is just coming into flower. A group of woman laugh and pick the best buds before entering the house and filling the heavily lined wooden corridors with laughter.

Shift to Interior

A thin, bright faced woman in her mid thirties strokes the ruff around her neck. It feels tight today but she will not allow herself the pleasure of wearing the looser summer clothes of her ladies. They enter her room and bow slightly before placing the freshly picked flowers in vases.

Lady Brunswick

You should have joined us madam. It is surely the finest day.

Mary

I do not like too much sun, but the flowers smell beautiful. Put a vase in the window there.

The woman does as directed and then peers through the window.

Lady Brunswick

It looks like horsemen approaching, at least two, or perhaps three, Either that or their speed has kicked up all hell. Look at the clouds of dust.

Mary

Let me see.

She stands and goes to the window to peer out.

They do seem to be in a hurry, perhaps they have brought news; good news at last.

**She reaches down and strokes the crucifix that hangs on a chain from her waist**.

It looks like Lord Norfolk. I am glad, with him away in London these past weeks I have not been able to sleep. What with the whistling wind and the rustling of the trees, I have missed the protection of my best man.

Lady Brunswick

Particularly with the local ugliness we have had to endure. These peasants

are so godless.

Mary

God knows of the evil in this, God's pleasant land. Still let's not talk of witches today.

Lady Brunswick

They say if you look into her eyes, Morgan that is, you can feel the devil on your shoulders. I have heard said they will burn her for her sins.

Mary

No more talk of that creature, not today now my man has returned; although I would like to see the witch burn. Let me know of it if I am still forced to retire in this house or my freedoms will be extended.

Lady Brunswick

Of course Madame. Although, burnings are a shocking spectacle; the smells are horrendous. I am sure it would only horrify you madam.

Mary

Look, it is Norfolk.

the Ladies look out the window again.

Lady Brunswick

There, is that the Bishop on the further horse. Even though he is not dressed in his clerical cloth I would know that shape anywhere.

Mary

It is good news, I know it is. I knew my brother was weak, a frail bastard, but I never imagined he would only last months.

The two riders storm into the courtyard in the middle of the house and Mary leans from the upper window.

Norfolk, I am pleased to see you at last. Tell me what ails thee, your horses have been flogged to within an inch of their lives?

Norfolk

It's the king mistress. His life is coming to an end.

Bishop

Don't look too happy my lady, he has made arrangements for another to succeed.

Mary

No!

Bishop

It's true, this is why I cannot dare wear my vestments; I have to hide like a thief in the night.

Norfolk

If he knew the Bishop was back from France we would all join Bonner and Pole in the Tower, we must come in at once. No one must know he is with us.

Mary in her room falls to her knees and cries out.

SCENE 6 Int Night

Norfolk is in a side room with the Bishop who is taking his confession. When they are finished the Bishop makes the sign of the cross and Norfolk address' him.

Norfolk

Thank you for hearing my sins before you leave Holy Father.

Bishop

I may be in disguise but my secular clothing does not stop me practicing the true religion. I am sorry that I have to take my leave so quickly, but there is much to do if we are to outmanoeuvre Edward and see the restoration of the One True Faith to these lands.

The queen cannot be crowned until we have removed both the King's objections and Lady Jane Grey from the equation. As you know, it is she that he has ordered to succeed Edward upon his death. There is much evil at work here, I shall go back to London and try to remain undiscovered while you my Lord Norfolk must stay with the girl. You will protect her with your life?

Norfolk

I swear by God that no harm will come by her. She will be crowned this summer and we shall have the One True Faith restored again for all.

Bishop

You shall reap your reward Lord Norfolk, on Earth and in Heaven too. Be careful, the saints depend upon you in this hour.

Scene 7 Int Day

We see a small boy running through the great house, Mary runs after him, he turns a corner and hides.

Mary

I can see you

Boy

Catch me if you can

He laughs again and takes off being pursued through the great kitchen. Startled Kitchen maids get out of their way and smile although one drops a pot and threatens the boy with a wooden spoon. When she sees Mary the woman drops to her knees and looks away.

The boy rushes off and Mary follows

Old woman

Oh, to be a child again.

Cook

The woman is older then my daughter, she needs to grow up.

Old woman

Let her have her fun, if and when she is crowned she will have plenty to worry about, let her be a child and have some enjoyment of life for now; won't you?

Scene 8 Ext day

Mary and the child run into the court yard and she catches the boy.

Suddenly Norfolk's voice booms out of a window.

Norfolk

Rupert. Come here, you are going to London with the Bishop.

Rupert

Do I have to father? We are playing

Norfolk

The time for play has passed, my boy. Only toil and trouble awaits us now, come and get ready.

The boy takes Mary's hand

Rupert

I am sorry Mistress, but our game must end.

Mary

You must go, but I will see you soon enough dear cousin, in London when I come to recieve my crown.

Rupert

In the meantime I will look after your crown until you can claim it.

Mary

So you shall. Good journey then, dearest lad. Until we play again.

Rupert

Until we can play again.

Scene 9 Int Day

Mary runs down another corridor in the great house pursued by three ladies in waiting. At the end of the hall a door opens and Norfolk appears framed in the doorway.

Norfolk

What is all this noise?

Mary throws herself in his arms

Mary

Does my little friend have to go. I am so alone in this great, cold place, why take my only friend, the only person of my own age, why take him away from me?

Norfolk

You will not be alone, Mistress. Look, you have your ladies to gossip with and I'm here to be your friend. Rupert is just a boy; surely you need the company of adults around you.

Mary

**It** 's so unfair.

**Norfolk** (smiles)

Does the mistress of this great house sulk like a child?

Mary

Oh, you'd have me in sackcloth and ashes, a dour old maid before my time. I enjoy Rupert's company, if we behave like children, so what?

There's never been a time when I have been allowed the company of small boys, now that I have a small friend; I find I enjoy his companionship. Must he go?

Norfolk

Those born to greatness must give up what others take for granted mistress. To rule a realm, as you shall, one needs all the cunning of a fox, this is why you were not encouraged to play like other children. There will, no doubt be other things that give you pleasure in the coming years; while other woman ware haircloth and linen you will wear silk, jewels and a crown, mistress? That makes you a very special little person; there, this of that.

Mary

Sometimes I wish I was just like everyone else. If you were not so old I would have you as a true friend.

Norfolk

Too old, we could be married our ages are so close. I just appear older because I have had much responsibility thrust upon me. Especially today; you have yours to come. Then tell me how old I look.

(They both laugh)

Scene 10 Int Night

The ladies are attending to Mary, as she gets ready for bed. The moon is high in the sky beyond the window and candles throw their shadows around the room like dancing marionettes. Mary sits beside a dressing table and looks at her reflection while one lady combs her hair and two others fold away her day clothes.

Mary

Ah, the end to another day.

Lady Brunswick

Another day closer to your great moment my lady.

Lady Blister

Your coronation will be such a proud moment for us all, those of us who have stayed true to you and the One True Faith through all the recent changes and tribulations. I cannot wait for a Catholic bishop to place the crown of England upon your head, what a great day that will be. Not only will we have a Queen of England on the throne but the days of herasy will be over for good. The saints will dance that day; the saints will dance.

Mary

Edward is not quite dead yet and he and those heretic advisors who surround him drip poison in his ear about me constantly. They will do anything to block my accession; I cannot be too self-assured just yet. Oh, the worry of it all.

Lady Gardener

I don't know about Edward but the old King wanted you to succeed him, you being his natural heir. We'd often hear him talk of the day you'd become our queen; during his later years that is. It's a shame you never spoke to him much before he died.

Mary

I wish I could have spoken to him more often. But with that evil cow on his arm it was impossible. What she put my poor mother through condemns her to purgatory. I swore never to be in the same room as that bitch. Of course I loved my father and wanted to be at his side but alas, it was not to be. Then of course his hatred of the One True Faith, he may have forced me to choose between that bitch and my mother but how could he expect me to choose between him and my God?

Lady Blister

He missed you in the end, you know. I feel he died with regret on his lips.

Mary

Really, how sad. Oh, all this talk of the past is making me feel quiet blue, now with Rupert gone I fear I shall die of boredom, particularly if Edward lingers.

Lady Blister

Well, you could always go to the burning.

#### Lady Brunswick

Shut your mouth girl unless you want a beating from the master.

Lady Blister

Sorry mistress.

Mary

No, speak up, what is that you said?

Lady Brunswick

She is talking a/bout the witch Morgan; she is going to be burned any day now.

Lady Gardener

God forgive her for her wickedness.

Mary

Oh, tell me more. I relish any excitement no matter how distasteful.

Lady Blister

I saw a burning when I was a girl, it turned my stomach; it is truly a horrible sight. But, well, they say Morgan deserves no less for killing those poor children.

Lady Brunswick

They say she killed them and offered their blood to Satan. She practiced demonic ritual and...

Lady Blister

And that she cut the throats of the newborn; they say she ate human flesh. That she worshipped a huge serpent god. They say she practices necromancy and can fly like a bird. Most of it supersticious rubbish, no doubt.

Lady Gardener

It's all idle gossip isn't it? No matter what she has done I don't think anyone should end up like crackled pork. With an audience watching no less, how horrible is that?

Mary

Do they really end up like crackled pork?

Lady Blister

The hair catches fire first and then their eyes melt in their sockets, turn to jelly they do. A chain at their waist tethers them so they can prey apparently but mostly they push the burning embers away as their wrists get hot from the chains.. I'd rather die quickly if it were I.

Lady Brunswick

Do we have to have all this gore at bedtime ladies? If Lord Norfolk heard us talk like shrews he'd have us sent away.

Mary

Then he must not hear us talk, understood, it shall be our secret.

Lady Brunswick

Yes mistress.

Mary

As these burnings are so rare these days I feel I would like to be there for this one. Is there any way I can leave the house without a cohort of armed men beside me, I wonder?

Lady Brunswick

Well, if you wore in a shawl instead of a bonnet, I think the people would see you as a grand lady perhaps, no less. After all no-one knows you are here at Kenninghall except us. But the burning is the morrow, I do not think we have time to make such a plan?

Mary

We'll have time. Instruct cook to prepare us a picnic and get the stable boy to have the coach ready for us. Goodnight Ladies , I will look forwards to escape from this prison; if for only one day at least. Now to bed and sweet dreams I feel. Remember, ladies, Norfolk is to remain ignorant of our plans or like as not he will only talk me out of it.

Lady Brunswick

As you wish my lady.

Lady Gardener

Oh please reconsider Mistress, I see only grief coming from such folly. Think of your eternal soul.

Mary

Goodnight dear ladies. I will sleep tight with the knowledge that you all care so much for my soul. Fear not, I will survive the day as I have the past 30 years. Now go while I say my prayers and retire.

Lady Brunswick

Fair night mistress

The three ladies leave the room and close the door behind them.

Lady Gardener

I hope Lord Norfolk does not hear of your plans because his hell is greater I fear then any you will have in the hereafter. They say there is a special place in hell for such wickedness.

Scene 11. Int Night

Somewhere else in the house Norfolk is entertaining a Captain friend from the navel yard at Chatham who arrived at the house with two women in tow shortly after the Bishop left. One, an elderly Baroness and the other, her daughter Rose. They are drinking wine and sitting by a gently blazing fire.

Captain

They tell me the King is about to die, some tumour on his lung I hear. Such a shame, how old is the boy?

Norfolk

Only 15.

Rose

Shame.

Captain

Then there's plan afoot for your charge to become queen?

Norfolk

Not quite. There is a lot of anger because she refuses to give up her faith, King Edward has even left instructions for her to forgo the succession so that the crown passes to his protestant cousin Lady Jayne Grey; it's all going to get very messy I fear.

Captain

He can't do that, can he? She is the rightful heir after all, daughter of his first wife?

Norfolk

The one who Henry said he'd married unlawfully. Surely you remember all the trouble he caused trying to have the marriage dissolved; God, what a mess. Edward will try, or at least those around him try to prevent Mary's rightful accession; people like Dudley and the others, but Mary has many powerful people working to protect her rights. With God's will she will be crowned.

Captain

We travel to London you know, I wonder if we will still be around when the coronation is planned, you will get me a seat in the Minster I hope?

Norfolk

If you come with as sweet a company I will.

He smiles at Rose.

Rose

You flatter me sir.

Baroness

My daughter was to be married last year but alas with the death of the old king I felt a celebration should be held off, now we may have another death to mourn and I feel her suitor will loose interest after such a long time. Youth and beauty are fickle friends.

Norfolk

The mourning for Edward will not be as great as it was for his father. After all Henry was on the throne for most of our lives, we all were affected by something he did; that's why his passing was so traumatic for the country. The passing of this boy will not be too great an event, then we will have the celebration of a lifetime; a Catholic queen at last.

Captain

When the old King died they served hot rum in the mess and we drank like pigs down there. That being a royal ship, an all, they took great care to ensure we mourned the king's passing appropriately, Not like the merchant ships, you'd be lucky to get a cup of warm grog in your belly on such occasions. I miss not the merchant fleet I tell you, what with the slaves and flies, never again, worse then a Spanish brothel.

Baroness

And you should know, Sir.

They all laugh

Captain (He tickles the baroness)

You wicked woman, wait till I get your sails down and blow you a broad-side that'll get your masts rattling.

Rose

Oh, please. Can't you two get a room?

Norfolk

Yes, the day has been too long for all of us, I shall call a servant to take you to up.

Baroness

Are my daughter and I to share or have you planned the arrangements to suit us all?

Norfolk

You could say that, you, my beautiful Baroness will have the pleasure of your own room as will this lovely child of yours.

A boy enters.

Here is the boy now.

Baroness

What a beautiful livery, seeing the servants dressed so wonderfully shows that we are indeed in the house of royalty even if we don't get the chance of seeing the mistress personally.

Norfolk

I will try to introduce you tomorrow, at breakfast I hope.

Captain

If you could old friend, I did promise the ladies.

Baroness

Come Rose, we must retire now.

Norfolk

Er, (Addressing the captain) my friend can you accompany the Baroness to her room, the boy will lead the way. I will show Rose to hers.

Captain

Of course. Goodnight then, my friend, see you in the morning.

Baroness

Looks at Rose suspiciously

You will get to bed soon, my dear?

Rose

Of course, Madam. Lord Norfolk has the honour of a gentleman, I am sure he will look after me like the gracious host he is; goodnight mother.

The captain and the Baroness leave the room

Norfolk pours them both more wine and sits beside Rose smiling

Norfolk

You have not changed at all in the years since we last met. Well, perhaps a little.

Rose

I was a child back then, even so I remember you always had a particular interest in me, or certain parts of me at least.

Norfolk

What parts be they then?

Rose

You know what parts I talk of. My legs for instance...

She pulls up the hem of her long dress.

Do you remember them looking so fine?

Norfolk

Oh, sweet girl, never.

Rose

Perhaps if you placed a hand upon this leg, your memory may be awoken still further.

Norfolk

What, like this?

He touches her knee gently and she reaches down and holds his wrist pulling his hand higher up to her thigh.

Rose

No, like this perhaps?

Norfolk

Of course, how could I forget such warmth?

Rose

Touch slightly higher master, feel more warmth radiate there.

Norfolk

Ahm, yes, indeed.

Rose

Oh, how my heart flutters. Your touch makes my breath faint.

Norfolk

Perhaps you need to remove the cumbersome attire that restricts you so?

Rose

I believe you may be right, but tell me, are your breaches as cumbersome as this silk dress?

Norfolk

They are, what a bright girl. Come let us remove the shackles of our discomfort now that we are alone.

Rose

Yes, kind sir, you are the only man I know who can charm the clothes from my back. First prey, blow the candle so my modesty should be only slightly tainted.

Norfolk

Of course, anything for modesty.

Scene 12

Norfolk awakens the next morning and is surprised to find his bed empty and light streaming in through the open window shutters. He stumbles out of bed and opens the door, outside is a valet waiting patently.

Norfolk

Tell me, what happened to the Baroness and her daughter?

Valet

It's nearly afternoon Sire and they left some two hours ago. They said to let you sleep as you'd had a late night.

Norfolk

They did, did they?

Valet

Yes Sir. Shall I help you dress?

Norfolk

No, no need for that, go and tell cook to do me something to eat and I will visit the kitchen on the way to see the Princess.

Valet

The Princess Sire?

Norfolk

That's right boy, now stop fooling around and be off with you.

Valet

Of course my lord.

S **cene 13. Int Day**

Norfolk enters the kitchen dressed a few moments later. The women are preparing the evening meal but he sees some bread and cheese put out for him at the table. One of the princess' ladies approaches.

Lady Gardener

I trust you slept well master?

Norfolk

I did, although I woke with a sore head and aching heart, why was I not called when my guests left this morning?

Lady Gardener

You we left asleep on the instruction of my mistress.

Norfolk

I was?

Lady Gardener

Yes Sire, she got it into her head that you were better left in your bed.

Norfolk

Did she?

Lady Gardener

Yes Sire

Norfolk

And, prey, tell me why, the princess wanted me left in my bed for the day?

Lady Gardener

I'm sorry my lord, I wish I could be honest but I was told to keep quiet.

Norfolk

What's this, secrets? Come now girl, you may keep secrets from your peers but you must answer me in truth if I ask you a question, do you understand?

Lady Gardener

Oh, Sire, I do feel awkward.

Norfolk

Tell me, why did the princess want me left in my bed this morning?

Lady Gardener

She wanted to go out and thought you would try to stop her going my lord, she went despite my saying you would not be pleased about it.

Norfolk

Really, what would cause you to think I would be displeased if the princess took her leave, this isn't a prison you know. She can go where she wishes provided it is in the grounds.

Lady Gardener

It's not the fact of her going out sire but...

Norfolk

Come on, out with it.

Lady Gardener

It's not the fact of her going out but rather the event she has chosen to visit. It was an event she feared you would not approve of; that you may have even tried to stop her attending.

Norfolk

Well, come on then, where has she gone. Speak up?

Lady Gardener

To the burning sire, she has travelled in disguise with Lady Brunswick and Lady Blister to see the witch Morgan meet her end, I am sorry to have deceived you. I was told not to say...

Norfolk

What, she has left the grounds, without a guard. She has left the safety of this house alone, without protection? Are you saying she has done this just to see Morgan burn; has everyone in this house gone insane?

Lady Gardener

She told me not to tell sire. Am I in terrible trouble?

Norfolk

Girl, you are not in trouble, you have done the right thing bringing this folly to my attention. Now, go tell my groom to make ready my horse and call out two swordsmen to meet me in less then a cock crow by the stables.

That Morgan creature is no sight for a lady and the crowd could possibly harm the mistress of this house if they recognise her. Go, I will get my riding boot and be there quickly.

Scene 14 Ext Late afternoon

Mary and Ladies Brunswick and Blister are sitting on a blanket among a solemn crowd in the middle of a town square. The sun is shining and the event has the air of a summer fayre with stalls selling food and minstrels playing music. No one has noticed the woman in the dark shawl is the princess and her friends, Ladies In Waiting. The crowd being concerned with the erection of the stake, watching as it is surrounded with dry faggots.

A rumble goes through the crowd and the women stand and peer over the heads of those in front as a cart draws near; pulled by a black horse. Aboard the cart is a man dressed in a black leather hood and apron, he is holding a chain in one hand and attached to the other end is the squatting shape of a dishevelled woman. All the crowd can see is her raven hair but Morgan's face is obscured by the deep sides of the cart.

The horse and cart come to a standstill beside wooden stake and waits as a man dressed in the uniform of a local cleric climbs aboard and reads a paper to the assembled crowd.

Cleric

In this year of our Lord 1553, in the county of East Anglia sitting before the Crowns Lord Justice in the county assizes, this here creature, Morgan Fairchild, born of the county of Northumberland some three score and ten years hence was indicted for the heinous and abominable offences of abduction and murder.

In as much that she, on or before the first day of May 1553, in the said county of East Anglia, did take, carry off and steal no less than ten young infants without lawful permission of their guardians with malice aforethought. Whence detained by the county bailiff the said Morgan Fairchild was in possession of articles belonging to the missing children and indeed surrounded by all manor of abomination that it was evident that she had killed the said children with un-godly brutality.

(A gasp rang out in the crowd as the cleric paused briefly)

When questioned in the assizes this woman admitted using the children's mortal remains with the intention of causing demonic possession, guided by Satan and his unspeakable legions; being evil and without remorse.

The county Lord Chief Justice when presented with this evidence asserted that a further charge of necromancy and witchcraft be held against this woman and that all charges were proven.

It has therefore been legally held that she must suffer the punishment for these heinous and abominable actions, in that she be taken to the county in which her crimes were committed and there be burned. So saieth the Lord's Chief Justice, and may God and Mercy upon her soul.

At that point the man in the black hood pulled his chain and Morgan rose up in the cart. Her black clothes billowed in the wind and her hair was taken up by a gust so strong that each strand resembled serpents that danced about her eyes.

The crown gasped as Morgan laughed a fruity shriek causing the birds to fly their nests and cover the sky with black streaks. She was dragged from the cart to the beating of a slow drum; howling all the time; imitating a wolf at midnight calling down the moon.

A priest stood before her reading from the bible as Morgan was dragged through the square to the stake.

Priest

Yhe, as I walk through the valley of death I shall fear no evil...

Morgan's eyes make contact with Mary's across the short distance as she is led to the pyre. Morgan's hair is blown up as clouds move in to cover the sun.

For you are with me and your rod and staff they comfort me...

Morgan is chained to the stake by the man in the black hood and she smiles broadly. The crowd start shouting insults but her eyes are fixed upon Mary's. Mary is transfixed by that stare; there is something in the glint that holds her attention.

You prepare a table for me in the, presence of mine enemies , you have anointed my head with oils...

The priest looks towards the cleric who nods that the fire be lit. The man in the black hood throws a burning peg onto the dry faggots and they immediately start to combust.

Repent woman, repent before it is too late.

Mary looks over the flames and instead of seeing fear in Morgan's eyes sees only intensity, a glowing brightness that seduces her reason. Morgan smiles benignly and howls with laughter.

Lady Brunswick

It's truly hideous, look at the way she enjoys the fire.

Morgan begins to whisper something that no one but Mary can hear. The words are lifted by the flames and carried to where Mary is stood, she finds herself smiling back at the woman as they both exchange a silent greeting.

Madam, please look no more, oh Jesus, the smell, it's awful.

Lady Blister

She is enjoying her death, look at the smile on the woman's burning face..

Cleric

Repent Woman! Repent! My cup overfloeth, surely goodness and love...

A shrill scream rings out from the mist of the flames and as the pyre smoke rises the sky becomes overcast and dark. A malevolent wind appears to blow through the crowd and a sudden fear falls over the assembled. A crack of thunder rumbles and all look towards the dark sky and fear.

will follow me, all the days of my life and I shall live in the house of the lord forever...

Another loud clap of thunder roars out and a searing flash of lightening makes the crowd run in all directions. Behind the chaos and noise Mary hears a whispering echo in her ears and she feels totally isolated. In the mist of all the panic and terror she feels only peace and wonder, she smiles towards the raging fire.

Suddenly Lady Blister tugs her shoulder.

Lady Blister

Mistress, come, let's go...

T **he sound of horsemen approach and the women look up to see Norfolk and two men riding towards them at speed.**

Norfolk

Mary, come, let me pull you up, this is no place for a lady.

He looks at the two Ladies in Waiting with disgust and pulls Mary upon his horse.

I will talk to you two later.

His horse turns and he and the woman gallop off into the distance. As they leave the village they do not notice a small black cat following them.

Scene 15. Ext Day

We see a man pinning a royal proclamation to a wall. It reads:

Concerning

Edward V1 of England

The King gave up his life today

6th day of July 1553

following a short illness. He

shall be laid in rest

At Weftminster

one week

from this sad day

LONG LIVE THE QUEEN

Scene 16 Int Night

To please the new queen a costume ball was thrown and all the land's nobility were invited to ensure that they knew that, despite Edward's instructions regarding Lady Jane Grey, Mary was to take the throne.

They assemble at Mary's East Anglian residence and are met with a large hall decorated for a celebration. Some of the guests whisper how thoughtless it was having a ball as the King had not been buried yet. Other are not concerned about that issue thinking that the end of the protestant religion had come and celebration was necessary to herald back Catholicism.

The evening starts with drink and merry dancing until a little after dark when a trumpet sounded and all eyes turn to the stairway. Mary descends attended by two valets in the royal livery and Norfolk walking a few steps behind her, he wears a simple black sash in mourning to the dead King. Mary wears nothing of mourning.

The crowd part and allow the party to walk across the hall and up to a podium at one end. Upon this podium sits a seat under a vast red canopy.

Norfolk

God save the queen!

The assembled call back in salutation and Mary sits giving them permission to continue dancing. She slumps in the seat; looking pale and sickly.

Lady Brunswick

My Lord Norfolk, can I ask for your hand in this dance?

Norfolk

Of course, madam.

He smiles and bows taking the woman's hand and leading her through a dance.

Lady Brunswick

The queen looks ill today, don't you think?

Norfolk

Anyone would look ill when compared to you my sweet Lady, are you courting at present?

Lady B

Keep your thoughts on the dance my randy Lord, I just wonder what troubles her so. She has not been herself these past few days. I saw her throwing up two days past and yesterday she was feverish. Do you think she looks well of not?

Norfolk

It's the loss of the king, remember her father only died recently past and no doubt combined with the loss of her half brother, this grief has some accumulative effect.

Lady B

You know her so well my Lord.

Norfolk

Come dance closer to the garden door so I may get to know you better.

They dance to the huge doors that lead outside to the formal gardens. As they are leaving the candle-lit hall and stepping into the moon lit night another guest approaches.

Guest

Tell me my Lord, can I impose on the queen for a dance perhaps?

Norfolk

Why not, but be aware that she is not right at present and may reject your advances, but go if you feel brave man. Go, it may bring her mood up a little.

The guest turns and leaves Norfolk and his woman to go further into the gardens. He shyly approaches Mary before kneeling very deeply.

Guest

Could I beg your hand for a dance, Mam?

Mary is slumped in the chair and her head is resting upon on hand.

She spies him suspiciously.

Mary

A dance, you want to dance with me?

Guest

If it pleases your majesty.

Mary looks coy, but takes the man's hand anyway and they move to the centre of the dance floor.

The other guests smile and make way for them and soon there is a clearing for them to use. Mary and the man bow toward each other, as is the custom, and a lute and flute begin playing. Mary begins to dance but suddenly she feel slightly sick and the room looses focus. The faces around her blur and all the can hear is the sound of the flute; it feels like it is drilling into her brain.

Suddenly she falls into a heap on the floor. The crowd gasp.

The guest she was dancing with stands back and looks astonished.

Guest

I did nothing. Honest, she just fainted.

Lady Blister.

Quick, fetch Lord Norfolk, he is in the garden with Lady Brunswick

###### Scene 17 Int Day

It is the following day and all the guests have left. The house is being tidied by the staff who are busy picking glasses and mugs up and throwing food into hog-bins. We find Norfolk with a messenger in his private room.

Norfolk

Thank the bishop for the news of Lady Jane but tell him on no account must Jane be seen in London. We must conspire to keep her in Devon.

The queen appears to be affected at this moment with a strange ailment but I will ensure she is ready for the coronation in two weeks even if I have to take her there on her sick bed.

Messenger

You don't think it wiser that we postpone the coronation until the mistress is better?

Norfolk

That is not an option, we only have a short time to delay Jane's entry to London and if we are late the crown may be lost. These are dangerous times and there are powers at work to keep Mary from ever taking office, it isn't just Dudley we have to watch, this whole country has been practicing a heresy since the last King and if we are to change this we must not delay. No, the girl will be ready in two weeks, I give him my word.

Suddenly the door busts open and Lady Brunswick rushes in.

Lady Brunswick

Lord Norfolk, please come, the Queen's condition worsens.

Norfolk

Get off my man, to London and with god's speed.

He turns and follows the lady down the corridor beyond as the messenger folds the bishop's letter and places it into a bag hung from his waist.

Scene 18 Int Day

Norfolk and Lady Brunswick approach Mary's room and they do a sense of foreboding crossing Norfolk's mind, the wind appears to be howling and that part of the house is colder then normal.

They enter the room to find Mary standing by a open window naked, a pool of urine and blood between her feet and her hair being taken up by the wind. She turns as they enter and a black cat falls from her arms before scampering out the open door.

Norfolk

(To Lady B) Quick, close the window while I put her back into her bed,

Lady Brunswick

Yes sir.

Norfolk

Get a fire lit in this room, it's freezing.

Lady Brunswick

Sir.

Norfolk

From where did that awful cat come? Make sure it does not bother the mistress again.

Scene 19 Int Day

Norfolk is going back down to his room chuckling to himself when he comes across Lady Blister going in the opposite direction.

Norfolk

Good day Madam.

Lady Blister

Oh, you gave me a start. I heard the mistress had taken a bad turn and was about to attend to her; tell me, how is she?

N **orfolk**

I put it _all_ down to _woman's troubles_ , my Lady. That, and the grief of losing her father and half brother so soon, but it appears woman's ailments trouble her and they are no ills for a man to bother himself with.

Lady

I notice her humours were rising yesterday but it cannot be a period for the last one was less than three weeks past.

Norfolk

Oh, I know nothing of such topics Lady, go to your mistress and try to coax her back to her old self . We have plans afoot. Before the next full moon I expect to see her well again. You must keep me informed every day if it appears that she is still ailing as a barber may have to be called to loose a little blood,

#### Lady Blister

I will ensure regular reports are delivered to your room Sir.

She bows and continues on her way.

###### Scene 20 Int day

We find Norfolk in the great house's hall talking to a visiting Rector. They are drinking wine and walking for exercise.

Rector

We must make sure that she gets to London before the 19th of this month, Lady Jane is making her way from the Devon retreat her uncle has secluded her in. If we are going to out manoeuvre them all it is imperative that the people of London see their queen ready for the crown before Jane arrives. Once that has happened we can make arrangements for her to never arrive, if you know what I mean.

Norfolk

What of Elizabeth?

Rector

She too had been excluded by the Patent for limitation that Edward left prior to his death; even though she is not even catholic. So she has no plans to make trouble for us.

If Mary is crowned queen it opens the way for Elizabeth to succeed her when the time comes. By then all England would have been Catholic under Mary for a great many years and it will be impossible for Elizabeth to change back to the heresy the country currently labours under. How is Mary, I heard she has been ill recently?

Norfolk

She's fine, a few woman's troubles, nothing more. She will be ready by the 19th.

Rector

Tis'a strange women's problem; if it keeps her a prisoner in her room?

Norfolk

She is not a prisoner, you hear? She has the company of her Ladies and likes to enjoy the quiet up there. You have to consider the grief she is dealing with presently. The death of Edward followed her Father's too soon.

Rector

Ha, if any one mourns the old king I'd say they'd not known him too well, as for Edward, well, she and he hated each other. The last time they met the scene was a farce, both shouting and in tears. Why would she mourn that?

Norfolk

Grief affects us all differently sir, I thought if of anyone, you would know that as fact.

Rector

True, forgive me, I didn't mean to be insolent.

Norfolk

She has a new friend as well, one who takes up her time and to whom she is devoted.

R **ector**

A man? I thought....

Norfolk

##### Laughing

Not a man, no, the King of Spain can rest easy, a cat, my friend, the queen is besotted with a cat. She spends hours with the thing beside her, they say animals can bring people out of the melancholy and so the Ladies indulge her interest.

Rector

Cats, filthy creatures, but if it comforts her in her hour of need who am I to comment.

Norfolk

True, so our plans are afoot kind sir.

Rector

The bishop is sending me regular reports regarding the intrigue concerning Jane and her Protestant sympathisers; let's keep our head now and after these dangerous times we can relax and start enjoying life again.

So many of our friends are in prison, Cardinal Pole, Bishop Bonner and of course Lady Gardener's husband Stephen. How can they expect us to forsake the One True Faith for a heresy thought up by a man? I don't understand it.

Norfolk

Indeed sir.

###### Scene 21 Int Night

Norfolk decides to visit the queen's room before it got to late to see how she was that day and is walking through the house with a candle burning gently in his hand. He stops outside the room and listens hearing banging and loud whispers coming from within. Throwing open the door he is confronted by the two Ladies Brunswick and Blister

There is a wind blowing through the open window and papers and clothing are being flung into the air as the three women roll about on the floor. The queen throws of the two women and runs up the walls and across the ceiling.

Mary

Come Bitches, if you still have fight.

Lady Brunswick

Breathless

Sire, help us please. She's been like this for an hour.

Norfolk

Go and get a barber surgeon, go at once.

Brunswick adjusts her clothing and leaves the room; Norfolk goes to the window and closes it.

Mary

Come to fuck me have you? Come on then, eat this first!

She lifts her nightdress and exposes herself to both Norfolk and Lady Blister.

Norfolk

Put yourself away madam. I don't know what games are being played here but I will not have you exerting your grief in this way.

He turns to Lady Blister

Quick, help me.

He and the lady push Mary to the bed and Norfolk tears strips of bedding to tie her hands.

Mary

Tie me, do you, TIE ME? you fucking bitches!

Lady Blister

I've never heard her use profanities like that before; look at her face, her countenance is frightening.

Norfolk

I confess to never hearing a woman's problems manifesting themselves like this.

Lady Blister

Woman's problems? This has nothing to do with women. This is the devil at play, The Devil Sir!

The queen starts talking in a strange language, then Spanish, French, Chinese and then Latin, a language she had said she could not understand.

Listen to her talk, what is she saying?

Norfolk

I can hardly understand, but it sounds like....

Lady Blister

Diablo, sire, Diablo est dues inverses...

Norfolk

The devil is God in reverse, what is going on here?

Scene 22 Int night

The two ladies, Norfolk and the surgeon barber are in the kitchen standing by a blazing fire.

Barber

I have to confess, it's not something I am accustomed to. Bleeding will do nothing for the mistress' malady. That scratch across your face; was it her that did it, to herself? Lord Norfolk, tell me, has she ever acted so before?

Norfolk

Never, in fact Mary is usually very quiet. Withdrawn even, the only time she ever came out of herself was in the company of my child, young Rupert. Since he has been gone she has been sinking into this horrible affliction.

Lady Blister rubs some alcohol into a deep scratch across his face which makes him wince.

Lady Blister

The woman up there is nothing like our mistress. It is like she has been stolen and a horrible imposter taken her place.

Barber

Then your problem may be less medical and more theosophical.

Lady Brunswick

Theosophical, what on earth do you mean?

Barber

Let's say, it's more a crisis of the spirit then of the body's natural functions. This type of malady has been well documented in the past but these days, what with modern thinking and such, even the church has reviewed its views; people are less troubled by such matters, superstition and such like.

They used to believe that when people are unable to make peace with God they become troubled. They become vulnerable to the influence of all sorts of evil forces.

Norfolk

She has missed her regular confession and has refused to take part in any Anglican service. Mainly to be stubborn but she has also done this out of respect for the One True Faith. If I hear you correctly Sir, are you saying she is just acting out her passions; the devil mistook her rejection of Anglicanism as a rejection of God and moved in?

Barber

Not quiet.

Lady Blister

You're saying some evil force has entered her, this is her ailment, a possession?

Barber

Let's not use that word Lady, please, it's so emotive. We are modern thinkers, since popery and superstition was thrown from the country by good king Henry, we don't think of it like that no more. Instead of using a phrase from prehistory let us say she is being influenced by evil. Rather than being taken over, or possessed by it.

Norfolk

I want no one to speak that word again, not now or ever. By God, if Dudley and the Protestant contingent got wind of this in London, she'd be thrown on a pyre like a common witch. We must avoid all idle gossip, or our troubles will become insurmountable.

Lady Brunswick

How are we going to remedy her situation, we cannot just ignore it.

Norfolk

You say she is in crisis, without the direction of God and this has allowed evil to influence her?

Barber

Something like that, and if we were right, the only option would be burning. That'll cleanse the body of its malign force. Of course the cure would kill her.

Norfolk

THAT IS NOT AN OPTION. I will spend the night reading to her passages from the good book. It may help. Let us introduce her mind to God's holy word again. This will make the evil influences uncomfortable and they will want to leave and find another to pester. Eh barber?

Barber

You want to read the bible to her?

Norfolk

Yes.

Barber

In her room?

Norfolk

Yes,

Lady Blister

All night?

Norfolk

Well, you can do it if it pleases you, I will lend you my copy of the bible.

Lady Blister

No, no, go ahead. I know her honour will be intact in the morning and should she become irritated you have the strength to contain her, I do not.

Barber

It's not her honour I was thinking about, I know I wouldn't spend the night with her, alone.

Norfolk

I have known Mary for most of her life, I know her to be a gentle and considerate person with an endearing heart. If she presents herself any differently I will just put it down to the evil forces at work.

Lady Brunswick

My Lord, I must object. She has already injured you once tonight and you are far better remaining healthy, and here, than place yourself in reach of such demonic influences. It's no use, I shall have to go and read to her.

Norfolk

No. It could be dangerous.

Lady Brunswick

I must, you cannot be put at risk. There is too much at stake.

Norfolk

Yes, you are right.

The two ladies and Norfolk look towards the barber.

Norfolk

I will get you my bible.

Barber

Do what? I can't spend the night with her, alone.

Norfolk

No buts, this is your queen we discuss and she is in need of God. You are the only person who can help her tonight.

Barber

But it wouldn't be honourable...

Norfolk

It's only one night. You will be saving her soul.

Barber

It's not her soul I'm worried about. What if the bitch inside her attacks me? Can I punch her in the face?

Norfolk

**T** hat would be treason. You will just have to hope she enjoys the passages you read to her; and be ready to scream loudly if she does not..

Scene 24 Int Night

We find the barber sitting in the Queen's darkened lit only by a dim candle. He is reading from the book of Psalms but his attention is directed towards the resting shape of the queen as she lay on the bed. Suddenly a howl of wind blows past the window, he peers up at it and looks back. Mary is now sitting upright, the binds are off her wrists and she is staring at him intently.

Barber (Reading)

Vindicate me, O lord, for I have led a blameless life. I have trusted in you Lord without wavering, test me Lord and...try me....

He starts as the cat jumps from the darkness of the floor to sit at the end of Mary's bed. She holds out one hand and the cat goes to snuggle in her lap.

Er, I do not sit with deceitful men nor consort with hypocrites, wash my hands in innocence....

He looks up and Mary is no longer at the far end of the bed but sitting on it's edge just a few feet away. The barber starts to shake.

Mary

Carry on?

Barber

I recognise that voice.

Mary

Continue please, I was enjoying that passage.

Barber

Harriet, my Harriet, I would know that voice anywhere. What are you woman? A shape-shifting demon, a necromancer, what are you?

Mary

It's me, your lover, taken from you in childbirth; look it's me here, your Harriet.

Barber

Rubbing his eyes and seeing Mary change into a young woman. The flickering shadows play tricks on his vision and he feels scared.

No, there is evil at work here, (He stands and turns his back)

get behind me Satan.

Mary

Come my lover, I only wish to join with you again.

He feels the soft touch of sensuous hands at his neck and throws his head back in pleasure.

You remember how I touched you like this before...

Barber

Before, yes, before, but when?

Mary

You remember, my lover, before...

He drops the bible and turns to start kissing her wildly.

Barber

Yes, I remember you, before...

Mary

Before when I was....

Barber

Yes, when you were my true love...

Mary

Before when I was....

Barber

I remember, oh, I remember my true love...

Mary

Before I was....

Barber

Before?

Mary

Before I was dead!

He looks into the face he is kissing and maggots fall from her eyes. Stepping back, he wipes his mouth and outside the room a scream of terror echoes through the dark halls.

Scene 24 Int Night

A strong wind howls as Norfolk and Lady Brunswick run to the room. The lady's headdress is taken up by the draft and long shadows dance across the hall walls in a gothic dance of death; cast by the candle lanterns both carry the hall becomes a macabre theatre of the grave

Norfolk

Are you sure you heard screaming coming from within?

Lady B

I would not have come to your bed chamber sir if it had not been so.

Norfolk

It's quiet enough now.

Lady B

It was the screams of the wicked, Sire, the wicked being tortured in purgatory. I've never heard such horror before. It was terrifying...;

Norfolk

Trying the door

The door is still locked, I have the key here in my pocket, it would be a strange creature that could scale the walls of this house to enter through the queen's window.

Lady B

It was a terrible sound, I am still stiff with fright Sire.

Norfolk

Well, I suppose, we had better make sure the mistress is in no harm, get behind me while I unlock the door.

He places the key in the lock and whispers

Mr Barber Sir, tis me, Lord Norfolk and the good Lady Brunswick.

No answer emerges so he opens the door wider and they both furtively enter. The sight that greets them is truly shocking, as red dawn light filters through the window flooding the room in a strange light, Brunswick gasps and covers her mouth with one trembling hand

The queen's bed is upturned and she is suspended by the wrists in the form of a crucifixion. The barber is nowhere to be seen, blood and entrails fill and drip from every flat surface. The bible has been ripped page from page and these loose leaves are falling like snow among them; the horror of the scene drains the colour from Norfolk's face.

Lady B falls to her knees.

Norfolk

What in God's name...

Lady B

Oh, God forgive us our trespasses and forgive those who trespass against us...

Scene 25 Ext Day

Norfolk and Lady Blister are in the courtyard waiting for a carriage to come to a halt. As it does a valet opens the door and a Anglican priest steps out. The Lady bows slightly and Norfolk offers his hand.

Norfolk

Thank you for coming Sir.

The priest looks at Norfolk's hand and then at the man sternly.

Priest

You offer your hand Sir, you offer your hand when all the time you are plotting to displace the church and replace it with Papal heresy; I fear this too is a plot of some kind in which I am to fall. For in all my years I would never expect an invitation to this house; just tell me, why have I been summoned here?

Norfolk

It's the queen.

Priest

Don't you mean Princess? Mary has not been crowned, yet, and in Edwards's letters, the Patent for the Limitation of the Crown; a document he drew up quite legally prior to his death, provision was made for Lady Jayne Grey to succeed. Not Mary. This country does not want Papist idolatry again.

Norfolk

Yes, yes, but politics and intrigue must wait for now, Sire. The mistress of this house requires spiritual guidance, and as all her bishops are in the Tower of London presently, she has no choice but to be administered to by the Anglican Church. Please, let us discuss this inside.

Priest

What is wrong with the Princess; don't tell me she decided to turn her back to Roman popery and has come to her senses?

Norfolk

If King Henry could not get her to do that Sire, when he was alive, knowing how persuasive he could be: it is unlikely that she would choose to do that now, Sire, now that he is dead.

Scene 26 Int Day

The priest is following the lady and Norfolk down the hall to Mary's room.

Priest

I do not understand, if she is still intent on practicing her heresy, why would she call on me to give her spiritual guidance, she must be aware the first advice to leave my lips would be that she turn her back on Rome.

Norfolk stops in his tracks and glares at the priest.

Norfolk

For GODS sake Sire, put all this intrigue to one side, the woman is ill. She is suffering from such a strange malady that we are all besides ourselves with worry; you are our last chance for a solution and so, in the name of Jesus, please find it in yourself to put the misery of the past to one side and help us; if only for the sake of this young woman; the daughter of the King, god rest his soul.

Lady Blister

It's true sir, she needs the help of God urgently and you must help her get it.

Priest

Surely she needs a surgeon, not a priest, if the girl is ill?

Norfolk

We have tried that and all it has done is make her worse; this particular time in her life her symptoms are far too important to ignore and wait for time to heal.. I must have her fit now, today, I am begging you to help, Sire. Please.

Priest

I am intrigued Sire; what could this woman suffer so greatly that a priest may be able to help when a barber surgeon has failed?

Lady Blister

We have never seen such a malady; it is unworldly.

Priest

What did the surgeon say when he saw her?

Norfolk and Blister look at each other.

Lady Blister

Oh Sir....

Norfolk

He said she is in need of spiritual guidance, Sire. That her mind is crying out for God, for the Lord's mercy. But words frail me, you must see her yourself to understand truly.

They arrive outside Mary's room and the air is freezing, pail clouds of condensation flow from their mouths and noses as they wait in the darkened hall. Norfolk takes a key from his pocket and pauses.

Before we enter sir, you must give me your confidence that not a word of what you see in here will leave your lips.

Priest

Are you keeping her prisoner against her will?

Norfolk

Of course not, it's just that...

Priest

What man, I am confused! Just what is going on here?

Norfolk

If only we knew.

He opens the door and the three enter. Mary is tied to the bed, her face bloody and bloated. There is a terrible smell in the air and all three gag as it enters their noses.

Mary

Ha, have you brought me more meat?

Priest

That stink, it's awful, and what is she referring to?

Lady Blister

She ate the barber...

Norfolk

We don't know that.

Priest

That smell, I can't stand it. What on earth is it?

Lady Blister

You'd think the bed was full of rotting corpses; it is truly vile.

Mary

Come closer priest, let me smell your bones, a fine stew they would make. I could cook your meat and make balls from your scrotum; hmmm, delicious.

Priest

Shut your filthy mouth woman.

Mary

Fuck you! I could eat your liver and boil your brain in mandrake root, what a heady concoction that would make.

Priest

She is condemned, condemned to hell for her papacy, the heresy has contaminated her.

Mary

If I let you eat my cunt will you let me stew your sacred heart priest?

Priest

You will burn in hell for that profanity.

Norfolk

You have seen enough, let us leave her.

Mary

I have eaten the blood of Jesus Christ and it tasted like bad garlic; your ball pudding would be a better sacrament. Yes, I could feast on your balls priest.

Priest

Shut your filthy mouth woman.

Norfolk

Come, let us leave her....

He drags the flustered priest outside and slams the door behind them before locking it again.

Priest

That woman should burn for such profanity, princess or not.

Norfolk

Don't be stupid, that is the queen you are talking about.

Priest

She is not MY QUEEN.

Norfolk

Yes, yes, I know we have our differences but we must be sensible. A woman of noble birth must be treated with deference. We must look at this illness Mary sufferings sensibly, and find a solution to it.

Priest

I have met Mary, that woman is not her. She is possessed of a different personality, a different spiritual personality in fact, her whole appearance is not as I remember. She looks possessed of a demon. If it is a demonic possession, of course, then only the purification of fire will cure her.

Norfolk

Is that all you have to offer me Sire; death?

Priest

The problem is this Sir, if we used our usual practice, torture, to elicit a confession; then burning would be the end result.

Lady B

A confession to what?

Priest

Of consort with devils, of course, what else? A person does not become possessed of evil unless they have sought comfort from devils at some point. As we know this to be true then death can be the only reward of such action.

Lady B

She has never sought comfort from....

Norfolk

Walking off

So that is all the Anglican church has to say, is it? That she deserves to die because she is ill, because she is not herself. Well, bloody charming. Is there no man in this realm that has an answer for me?

Priest

Wait, Lord Norfolk, wait; there may be one man.

They catch up with Norfolk and continue to talk as they head away from Mary's room.

He is neither a priest, nor follower of any church, a man I once met on my travels. A noble thinker, an alchemist, this man is knowledgeable of things known only to angels. He may have an answer for you.

Norfolk

Really, tell me where I can find him I will be ready to leave within the hour.

Priest

I have been told to not speak of this man, that he invokes demons and is able to control them, are you sure you want to introduce him to your mistress?

Norfolk

I would introduce her to Zeus himself if I thought this malady could be treated. What choice do I have?

Priest

If I give you this man's name it is not to help the queen, you realise that don't you? If I do it, it is to be a honourable servant of a noble Lady, nothing more.

Norfolk

Of course.

Priest

No one should know that I have helped you in this way.

Norfolk

That is an understanding we both share. Now, where can I find this man and what is his name?

Priest

He is a hermit. I met him on the Holy Isle of Iona some two years back where he had been brought for questioning. I know that he returned to his usual residence somewhere on Mullach Mor...

Norfolk

In the Highlands?

Priest

You know of it?

Norfolk

No, not really.

Priest

It is a small island off the Sound of Sleat. Many days riding from here and yes, it is on the other side of the Highlands. You will need some warm clothes and perhaps a strong sword at your side if you intend to venture there.

Norfolk

I have head that said before. How will I know this man, will I need a letter of introduction?

Priest

He will know you if you seek him out. This is no usual man I speak of; he was not dragged to Iona for nothing; there were rumours of necromancy and practice of the black arts. I tell you, this man may not have an answer but if there is one I am sure he will have it.

Norfolk

Thank you Sir. I am indebted to you. Even if this man has no answer for us I am thankful of your wish to help.

Lady Blister

How did he get away from Iona after being accused of Necromancy?

Priest

It was the strangest thing. I was told that he spoke for a short while to his questioners and convinced them that it was in their interest to allow him his freedom and for some reason they agreed.

Norfolk

He must have very great oration skills.

Lady Blister

Or perhaps he charmed their senses. Anyone normally dragged to Iona and questioned leaves only as ashes on the wind.

Priest

I understood that also, but this is no usual man. I found him enigmatic while also quite frightening. Now I must be going. Good luck Lord Norfolk.

He holds out his hand and Norfolk takes it and falls to his knees.

Norfolk

Again, I am in your debt Sir.

Scene 27 Ext Day

We find Norfolk riding from the house at speed, a broad sword at his side and a pack of provision strapped to the hind quarters of the horse. His thick red cloak is picked up by the wind and as the sun set he charges into the distance.

Scene 28 Ext Night

Some time later the horse is at a canter while they travel through a thick forest. Norfolk sees a light in the distance and heads toward it. A cottage in a clearing comes into view and outside a man is chopping logs by star light.

As Norfolk approaches the man puts his axe down and looks up.

Woodcutter

Good moonlight this eve, just enough to get some odd jobs done.

Norfolk finds this remark odd and smiles awkwardly. The old man has shoulder long white hair and a stray white beard which he strokes eyeing his guest with his intense blue eyes.

Norfolk

Quite, tell me good sir, am I heading in the right direction for the Highlands?

Woodcutter

What part of the Highlands, they cover a large area, you know.

Norfolk

I am travelling to the over side, to the island of Mullach Mor.

Woodcutter

Yes, your direction be true enough, you must cross the Sound of Sleat through the Great Glenn. See that star in the West there?

The old man turns and points to a heaven filled with bright stars but one is much brighter than the others; looking almost magical against the backdrop of black space.

The one that calls your name.

Norfolk

That star will lead me to the Glenn and to where I must cross the Sleat?

Woodcutter

If it calls your name it will.

Norfolk

Thank you for your help old man; here take this silver coin for your trouble.

Woodcutter.

Moon metal for my pocket.

Norfolk flicks a coin through the air and it lands soundly in the man's fist.

And moon light for your journey. Bid you well kind Sir.

The man took off his old hat and bowed low.

Norfolk

Fair be well to you Sir.

Scene 28a Ext Night

A carriage pulls up outside Kenninghall and Lady Brunswick goes out to meet it. Inside is the messenger Norfolk had sent to the bishop before her left and Rupert, Norfolk's son.

Messenger

I have news for Lord Norfolk

Lady Brunswick

He is not here, Sir, he is on an errand for the Mistress.

Rupert

Oh, I was so looking forwards to seeing father. Is Mary still here?

Lady Brunswick

She is boy, but you cannot see her, not at the moment anyway.

Rupert

Have I done something wrong?

Lady Brunswick

No, of course not, come let us get some food. No doubt you are hungry after your long journey.

Messenger

I am in need of rest.

Lady Brunswick

Come to the kitchen, we will see what cook has left and I will arrange a room for you.

Scene 28 b Ext Night

Norfolk looks ahead and the moonlight appears to be illuminating his path making the direction he is travelling much easier to make out. The star in the West glows brilliantly above the tree tops and now that it has been pointed out to him is impossible to miss.

On another night in another part of the forest. Norfolk comes across a ravine across which an old tree has lain making a makeshift bridge.

He dismounts and takes the horses reigns to lead it unsteadily across the bridge when a voice calls out. Norfolk looks across the bridge and on the other side in the twilight he sees a tall hooded man holding a staff.

Man

Hello stranger.

Norfolk

Good evening to you sir.

Man

Are you in need of help?

Norfolk

I can manage, thank you.

Man

What brings you out these parts, there is nothing but forest in the direction you are heading.

Norfolk

I am on an errand, I must travel to the Sound of Sleat for I seek a man there.

Norfolk drags the unwilling horse across the makeshift bridge and stumbles half way. The horse rears up and the hooded man runs to help. He calms the beast and together they manage to get it over.

Man

I have a camp just down there by that rock head and some stew cooking in a pot. Come and eat with me, you may not get another chance once you get into the thickness there.

Norfolk

That's very kind of you sir.

He looks into the mans blue eyes and sees only kindness looking back towards him.

Soon they are by a blazing fore with the horse tethered nearby.

Man

Have you come far friend?

Norfolk

East Anglia.

Man

Quite some way, your errand must be important.

Norfolk

The fate of the whole country depends upon it.

Man

Surely not.

Norfolk

It's is true alas. If I fail to find the man I seek then my life and the path this realm takes may be wrought with difficulties.

Man

What is it you want from the man your seeking, an army perhaps?

Norfolk

No, not an army, just an answer to an enigma.

Man

What, only one man has this answer, surely not?

Norfolk

So I have been told.

Man

Tell me what the puzzle be and perhaps I can help.

Norfolk

Oh, no I don't think...

Man

Come friend, a problem shared is a problem halved.

Norfolk

My mistress is suffering from a strange malady. She is not herself and has been acting, speaking and thinking in ways only a madman or criminal would countenance. We have taken her to a surgeon, there was no relief, to a priest, even less of an answer; now I seek a wizard of sorts.

Man

Superstition are manmade, wizards and such are of fairytales for children, don't you agree?

Norfolk

I thought so too, once, but if this man is not the wise one I have come to expect then the realm, this great Kingdom, with its freedoms and history, will be lost forever. I would have failed my mistress and all the people of this island.

Man

Well, superstition or no, I wish you and your mistress well my friend. They say sometimes faith is a mighty tool. That Moses used faith alone to split the seas. That story of magic and superstition, may appear a fairytale to some and yet we are told to have faith that it really happened.

Norfolk

Wise words my friend. Thank you.

Man

See the moon tonight?

He indicated the bright glowing disk that shone above their heads.

Norfolk

It does look bright, much brighter then I have ever seen, is it our location that makes it glow so brightly?

Man

It's a blue moon Sire, we get one every four or five years. They say it is an omen of sorts.

Norfolk

Now who is being superstitious?

Man

I have always' thought we could learn a lot from the stars, this moon seems especially bright, even for a blue moon. Let's hope that it brings you good order sir. Look here, I have a silver coin in my pocket, I will toss it into this fire and ask the fire gods to accept it as a token of luck for you.

Norfolk

Please, keep your change, you may need it.

Man

Give the fire, that flame of the gods, moon metal, silver I mean, and it will light your way, friend.

He tosses the coin into the flames.

Give thee luck in exchange for this moon metal, in the name of the old gods. The gods of earth, wind, water andfire. Amon!

Norfolk

That's a strange saying friend, where by did you hear it previous?

Man

You learn a lot in these here parts, you see if it's true.

Norfolk

I will that, friend, with that I must be on my way.

Man

Yes, I think you must have a star to follow.

Norfolk

What did you say, about a star?

Man

We all follow something, friend, what else on such a beautiful night can you follow, but a star? Look at that one in the West. Such a bright and beautiful star, I would follow that if I were looking for good charm.

Norfolk

Yes, someone else told me that not more then a day and a half ago.

Man

See, you learn a lot in these here parts.

Norfolk

Thank you for the food.

He goes and unties his horse.

Good bye.

Man

Bid you well friend, bid ye well...

Scene 28 c Int Night

Lady Bister leads the messenger and Rupert by candle light through the house. They eventually come to a room where she opens to door.

Lady Blister

Lady Brunswick thinks you will be comfortable in here sir.

Messenger

Thank you. Is the Lord expected back soon?

Lady Blister

I know not Sir, Lady Brunswick should know and you may talk to her in the morning.

Rupert

Can I say good night to Mary now?

Lady Blister

I am told to take you to your father's room and put you to bed. The mistress is ill boy, you are not to disturb her.

Rupert

Not even to say goodnight?

Lady Blister

Not even to say good night. Now follow me.

Scene 29 Ext Day

Norfolk pulls his horse through the climb at the end of the Great Glenn and once at the highest point of the High Lands sees a river far below.

He leads the horse down and snow is falling as they come to the river side. The water is flat and still but he is perplexed about how he is going to cross. Then he sees a boat approaching.

As the boat draws nearer he sees it is being rowed by two dwarf boatmen, in the centre of the boat stands an old coach. The boat cuts through a fine mist and when it has landed the dwarfs pull the coach from the boat and across the gravel foreshore.

Norfolk

Can I ask you to take me and my horse across this stretch of water my friends, I have payment for you?

The dwarf's ignore him and Norfolk approaches closer, inside the coach is an old man with a long white beard who is reading a great book. Upon his head is a crumpled old hat with a huge brim.

Excuse me friend?

The old man looks up and Norfolk is startled to see he resembles the old man he met in the forest.

Haven't we met before?

Old man

Have we?

Norfolk scratches his head and smiles coyly.

Norfolk

Could you ask your men if they'll take my horse and me across this water, I have to find someone on the other side.

Old man

If you do that I will not be able to use the horse over there,to take me where I am going, would I?

Norfolk grunts and scratches his head again looking at the front of the coach and seeing that it indeed has the yoke fitted for a horse but had none to pull it.

Norfolk

I need this horse to take me further as I am seeking someone on the other side

Oldman

You don't need to cross now my Lord, I have come to meet you.

Norfolk

Do you mean to say that you are....

Old man

When the mood takes me, yes, some know me as the hermit, you can call me Magus.

Norfolk

But how did you know that I....

Old Man (Magus)

All these questions, can't you see that these two helpful gentlemen are waiting to hitch the horse to our carriage? Come join me here and I will explain all as we continue our journey.

Norfolk looks confused but dismounts as asked and allows the two dwarfs to hitch the horse to the coach. He then opens the door and climbs inside to sit opposite the Magus

Norfolk

How did you know that I was coming in search of you and when I would be arriving at this side of the sound?

Magus

It was written in the stars my friend.

Norfolk

Do you not want to know why I am seeking you or what I was going to ask?

Magus

It was all written in the stars, my friend, every question on Earth has an answer up there, written in the stars.

Scene 29a Int Night

At Kenninghall Rupert is laying in bed looking at the ceiling. The wind is howling around the house and he is scared. He slips out of bed and goes to his door, peering outside to ensure no one is around.

He then follows the hall and corridors until he is near Mary's room. Making sure no one is near he creeps to the door.

Rupert

Mistress Mary, are you awake?

He tries the door and finds it locked.

Mary, it is me, your friend.

He hears the door unlock and smiles. Gingerly he opens the door and steps inside the room. Mary stands by the window, a black cat sitting alertly by her feet.

Mary

Rupert child, how I have missed you, come, close the door and join me.

Rupert

The Ladies did not want me to see you, they do not know I am here.

Mary

I will not tell them. Close the door child and join me by the window.

Rupert does as he is told and joins Mary. She runs her fingers through his hair and smiles.

Look at the moon child, see how beautiful it looks tonight?

Rupert

Yes, it does look bright. Mary, I have missed you so much in London. The adults are all so boring, always talking about religion and politics, I had to really persuade the bishop to let me return. He said you were ill...

Mary

Really, you see I am far from ill.

Rupert

He said you were not able to play and I said if only he's let me see you I'd get you feeling better. Do you feel better Mary, now I am back with you? You look different, really quite beautiful....

Mary

Yesssssss, child. I feel much better.

Her eyes turn black and a forked tongue slips out between her lips. She looks down at the boy and smiles, her mouth is full of shap teeth.

Lady Brunswick

RUPERT!

Mary and the boy look startled and see the Lady enter the room.

Come here at once.

The lady takes the boy's hand and pulls him away from Mary.

You were told to stay in your room, how did you get in here?

Rupert

Mary called my name and she was able to let me in, can't I stay.

Lady Brunswick

No, back to your room boy, go on, do as I ask.

She looks back to the snarling face of Mary

I shall post a guard on your door Madam, to stop unwanted visitors.

The boy and Lady leave the room and Brunswick locks the door after her. Outside stands Lady Blister.

If the Mistress calls for the boy again you must let me know.

Lady Blister

Yes madam.

Lady Brunswick

If she wants you or anyone else you can tell me in the morning, I will take the boy to his room, and this time ensure he stays there.

Scene 29b Ext Night

Back at the Sound of Sleat the coach is ready to be pulled by Norfolk's horse.

Magus

If you don't mind, we have a long journey ahead and I will not be much use to your mistress if I am tired when we arrive. So, with that in mind I will close my eyes and sleep for a while.

The dwarfs climb aboard the back of the coach and flick the reigns making it lurch forwards and their journey begins.

Norfolk

Would you prefer us to make a camp so you can rest properly?

Magus

Isn't your quest important?

Norfolk

Yes.

Magus

Haven't you a short period in which to deal with the problem at hand?

Norfolk

Yes.

Magus

Then we had better make haste. I will rest well beside you here and you can take the time to enjoy the beautiful views from the windows.

Norfolk looks out the window of the coach and notices how lovely the land looks swamped in bright starlight.

Norfolk

It appears you are well informed by the stars, I bet you even know the nature of the malady my mistress suffers.

Magus

Malady? The lady you serve suffers no malady, her affliction is far more serious.

Norfolk

The church have said as much, even they are at a loss as to what remedy can be used against it.

Magus

The church? Ha! The one-eyed leading the blind will walk in circles.

He takes off his hat and exposes a full head of long white hair and then scratches his scalp before rubbing his eyes.

The Church is no use in these matters, my Lord.

Norfolk

So, are you aware of her malady?

Magus

Her affliction is no malady, the reason the church have no answer for you is because this affliction is older, more devious, more subtle than any affliction they are aware of. It is far more serious than a mere illness, more dangerous than any malady you can catch; the woman suffers the working of a malediction.

Norfolk

A what?

The magus looks sternly eye to eye with the lord and Norfolk saw something malevolent burning in those bright blue eyes. Something deeply moving and, at the same time, unsettling lurked within them.

Magus

A malediction. It is a phenomenon as old as time itself, one which requires a treatment which itself, is as old as time; but more of that later. Now, I must sleep.

He placed his hat upon his head and after a few minutes the head fell forwards and the sound of soft snoring filled the coach.

Scene 30 Int Night.

Lady Gardener is in the house; cloistered in its hidden chapel preying in front of a small statue of Mother Mary and her Christ child. Between her fingers rosary beads are held tightly. Suddenly a valet enters and takes a small bow.

Valet

Lady Gardener, Mistress Mary has asked you to attend her.

Lady Gardener

She what?

Valet

She has asked for you to come to her.

Lady Gardener

For me, what, she asked for me by name?

Valet

I believe so my Lady.

Lady Gardener

It can't be, she has not said anything of consequence for days.

Valet

Perhaps there has been an improvement in her mood my lady.

Gardener crosses herself and curtsies to the statue before turning and allowing the valet to lead her through the house. Outside the room Mary is locked within, Lady Blister waits holding a candle.

Lady Gardener

My Lady, has the Queen asked for me by name?

Lady Blister

I am not sure, the queen has asked to see you, that is all I know.

Lady Gardener

Really?

Lady Blister

Shall I open the door?

Lady Gardener

If she has asked, I must go in.

Gardener clasps the rosary to her breast as the valet unlocks the door

While Lady Blister stands back allowing the younger lady to enter the room. She does so and the door closes behind her. Lady Gardener is shocked to find she is alone with Mary for the first time.

Mary is sitting on the end of the bed, her thin nightdress white and gleaming, her bright red hair loose and framing her face. Her skin bright and white. Mary smiles benignly. The room appears to be cloaked in an eerie light. The lady curtsies and smiles in return.

Mary's eyes appear to glow and her pose is similar to the pose of the statue Lady Gardener had just been praying toward. A bright light is illuminating Mary's head and the Lady feels slightly faint.

Mary

Don't be shy, young one.

Lady Gardener

Of course not Mistress.

Mary

Come kneel here.

Mary indicates with a bejewelled hand the space at her feet.

Come child, don't be afraid.

The Lady looks at Mary and sees the face of the virgin imposed upon Mary's. She becomes very frightened and tries to reach out behind her to open the door but finds it is locked.

Don't fear me child, don't you recognise your Mistress?

Lady Gardener

As you wish my lady.

Nervously she steps forwards and slowly goes down upon her knees.

Mary

Closer child, let me bless you.

Lady Gardener

Bless me?

Mary

Yes, bless you. Come closer, do not afeard me child.

Lady Gardener

I do not fear you mother. It is you mother, isn't it? I would recognise you anywhere.

Mary

Good, good child. Now look at the rose at my feet child, can you see the rose glowing there?

Lady Gardener

Yes mother, I see the rose, it is beautiful.

Mary

Kiss the rose child, let it light those ruby lips of yours.

Lady Gardener

Yes, yes Mother. Let me kiss the blood of that rose.

She dips her head down and her lips touch Mary's marble white feet as her fingers slowly clutch the rosary beads. Then with tears streaming from her eyes and down her face the young girl looks up.

Instead of seeing Mary towing above her she is confronted with a huge winged serpent who has its mouth wide and gaping. Her look turns to horror as the serpent bites down and takes the girl's head from her shoulders. The body slumps to the floor pulsating frothy blood and the rosary beads spill out across the room.

Scene 31 Ext Night

Norfolk is looking out the window when the moon comes from behind a cloud flooding the great Glenn in silvery light. Suddenly the Magus jumps and grabs Norfolk's shirt.

Magus

Evil is at work tonight!

Scene 32 Ext Dusk

A few days later the coach approaches the towering double faÃ§ade of Kennighall, inside the coach Norfolk wakes the magus.

Norfolk

You sleep well old man, three days and nights, but see our destination is in view.

Magus

I was not sleeping the whole time, I rested some and thought some. This problem should not be rushed into and I have been laying plans in my mind.

Norfolk

You talk in riddles man, you haven't even asked me what the problem is and yet you say you are finding solutions to it. How is this possible without knowledge of the problem?

Magus

I have been discussing the malediction with my elemental spirit, and we have devised a plan. We plan to end the evil that exists here once and for all. But look here, the house I have been roaming through in my meditations, it appeared different to the one I see here.

Norfolk

How does it look different?

Magus

I saw a much smaller house, one with a tower and gatehouse of stone.

Norfolk

Kenninghall once had a tower and stone gatehouse but these were taken down after the War of the Roses.

Magus

I thought as much, and that window up there, is that where the demon lurks?

Norfolk

Your powers are great my friend, that is indeed the queen's room but no demon lives there, just a frightened and ill young woman.

Magus

Put those thoughts away at once friend, the creature that dwells in that room is not your mistress, it is an evil entity that yearns for blood. Even while you have been gone it has taken more innocence from the world. Understand this! If you want your mistress back you must allow me to kill the demonic entity that resides here.

Norfolk

You can do as you wish, old man, so long as my mistress is unhurt. Can you guarantee me that?

Magus

I will do what I can but usually I would say that she is dead already, all we are doing is helping her soul to escape the claws of this entity and rest easy in her grave. I know that the realm depends upon her life continuing and so I will endeavour to save it. I can promise no more at this point, friend.

Norfolk

What can I do to help?

Magus

There will be time for talk later. First let my helpers unload the coach, my tools must be prepared.

Scene 33 Int Night

Norfolk and the Magus enter the house followed by the two dwarfs who are dragging a case behind them, a guard approaches.

Norfolk

Take the horse to the stable please, where are the ladies?

Guard

There has been trouble my Lord, I will send for Lady Brunswick, she is in the chapel.

Norfolk

What sort of trouble?

Guard

Lady Gardener was murdered, I am not sure of the detail. Terrible things have been happening in your absence.

Norfolk

What of the Mistress?

Guard

I shall call Lady Brunswick, she will explain all.

Magus

Enough of this small talk, come man, I have work to do.

He turns to the dwarfs.

Follow this guard to the demon's room and get an empty chamber next door where my case can be unloaded. There is not a moment to waste friends, the hour is upon us.

Norfolk

Guard, do as he wishes, there is a chamber on the other side of the hall from the mistress' room, they can take the man's case there.

Guard

Yes my Lord, what about Lady Brunswick.

Norfolk

I will find her. Tell me sir, what hour do you refer to?

Magus

I speak of the hour of Mars, the moon has lit our way, only Mars can help now, it is then that the work must start, not a moment before.

Scene 34 Int Night

We find Norfolk and the Magus in a side room situated just across the hall from Mary's. There is a long table that the dwarfs are covering in a purple cloth that hangs limply to the floor. They then open the chest and remove its contents one by one.

Firstly a long sword made of several metals with a five pointed star on its hilt, the blade of the sword is crossed in its midsection by an angled bar creating a cross of silver. The Magus kisses the blade before it is laid on the table. Next a long hazel wand is laid beside the sword, its tips are decorated with magnetised iron.

Then a small dagger is placed upon the table aside the sword, along its blade is inscribed a runic motto, a bell on the end of a long chain is next and then a whip made of calves skin. Then a book is placed on the table, Norfolk sees the book cover has a pentagram inscribed into it.

Norfolk

Strange tools these, what are they.

Magus

I have offered a vow of silence and so I cannot tell, now leave me for a few moments, my helpers must dress the room and my body, I will call you back shortly.

Norfolk

No, you cannot keep shrugging off my inquiries, sir, what are you going to do with these so-called tools?

Magus

(Sighs) All you need to know is this. The malediction is older than time and so the tools we need to combat it must be older than time too.

Norfolk

How do you know from what she is suffering, you have been told nothing.

Magus

I do not need to be told, the evil forces are reverberating throughout this land, I have felt them ever since they were summoned up from the depths of the underworld. I know this demon well and have fought it before, not here, but on Iona some years back when the monks there were cursed.

You must believe me when I say this is not my first time fighting this beast, it surely not will be the last. The malediction is a powerful curse, so powerful a door to hell was drawn back and a league of demons called forth. Most disseminated in the good air of this earth but one remains.

It was forced into the body of your mistress and resides in that place still, if we are to help the girl I will need to control the demon and send it back from whence it came.

Norfolk

How could this happen, what would have exposed her to such evil, I don't understand.

Magus

Only powerful magic can unlock the vaults of evilness that restrict these forces, something like a human sacrifice would do it. The emotional turmoil created by that act of extreme violence is powerful enough; has she sacrificed a human life recently?

Norfolk

I think not.

Magus

Think harder friend, there are only three ways of invoking such malevolent forces, one is through years of quiet introspection and then only briefly. The second is through the utterance of sacred names and then only after years of education in the meaning and pronunciation of those words of power and the third is through the violent death of a virgin.

You see, contrary to what the Church have told you, the universe has many layers, they overlap like the skins of an onion. The centre of this onion is our Earthly plane, we the initiates of my order, call it Malkuth; or the Kingdom. The second layer, or emanation of the great spirit, is called Yesod. This is the world of our dreams, the key to astral travel and the place where we converse with elemental spirits. Guides, if you like, guides to the other world which surrounds us all; the other Eden, a dimension of time and space which some visit with ease and others spend their whole lives trying to reach; failing at every turn; only experiencing its everlasting compassion and light after their mortal death.

Beyond that place, is Hod, the plane of activity and beyond that Netzach, the realm of water. Then further the planes of Air, of the Lovers, where Ra resides on his amber throne, we call that place Tiphreth. Further we find Geburah and Chesed, Binah and Chockmah until we confront ourselves, in that realm of equals. We shall call that place Keither, it is neither heaven or hell, it is a place of purity; pure love and pure light merge in a blinding realm of infinite compassion.

This girl you serve, this mortal raised up and called your queen, she has been entered by a malevolent force from one of these other worlds. If you think very carefully you will remember a recent time when a door was opened and she was offered as a sacrament to evil. You must know of an incident when these forces were set free, called up to roam among us mortals. It was then the malediction took root in the girl's soul.

Norfolk

Morgan, she was there when Morgan the witch was burned.

Magus

That would have done it. this act was done in her name? She is the keeper of this realm and all acts would have been in her name. You can see now, my friend, that this may be a consequence of that act.

Norfolk

Are you saying Morgan has entered her, that she is possessing her?

Magus

Haven't you heard anything man? No, Morgan merely invoked the creature, she would have taken the body of a familiar if she wanted to watch the demon at work. Are you aware of any familiar lurking nearby the afflicted woman?

Norfolk

What is a familiar?

Magus

A cat, a dog or raven, any creature a witch could manipulate and work through?

Norfolk

The girl has a cat, yes, this creature has been her companion ever since the start of all this. I shall take my sword and kill it at once.

Magus

Hold your sword and pray my friend. The familiar has its uses, when I am ready. Now allow me to dress, the work must begin.

Norfolk nods and leaves the room. After he has departed the two dwarfs take a tin of paint and trace onto the floor of the chamber a triangle in the East. It has sides measuring three feet each.

They drive a small nail into the centre of the floor and using a string attached to the nail draw a circle in the paint with a diameter of ten feet. They then drag the tape and place it in the centre of this circle. Then using a green paint the draw another circle outside the first and trace runic symbols within the two.

While they have been doing this the Magus has been sitting on the floor naked, His head tucked between his knees and deep in silent prayer. From his knees he sits up and sucks in a deep breath.

He holds the index finger of his left hand to his lips and whispers.

Ateth

Then he touches his right shoulder with the same index finger.

Ve Geburah

Then he lift his right index finger and touches his left shoulder crossing his arms over his chest.

Ve Gebulah

Then he drops his hands and holds his plams together over his crutch.

Le A Lohem.

He looks towards the dwarfs.

I am ready, bring my robe and crown.

In silence the take a small box to him and open it. Inside is a blue robe decorated around the neck with a green serpent, the tail of the serpent goes down the robe's back and encircles the bottom.

They pull this over his head. Then they take a thin blue hood decorated with stars which they place over his white hair.

Upon the hood they place a crown of gold, a serpent circles his brow and in its mouth a star is held. They then take a small white enamelled cross the centre of which is decorated with a fine rose motif. This is pinned to his heart.

Four burners are removed from the chest and placed in each corner of the room and they are lit by the dwarfs, smoke rises from them and the room is quietly filled with a pale mist

Get Lord Norfolk

One of the dwarfs leave the room and finds Norfolk waiting with the guard. Suddenly a small boy comes running down the hall towards him.

Rupert

Father, I have waited so long to see you.

Norfolk

Rupert, why are you not in London?

Rupert

I got bored with the bishop and wanted to come and see my friend again but these wicked Ladies have said I can't play with her. They lied telling me she was unwell, but I have seen her and she is beautiful. There is nothing wrong with her, they lied to me.

Norfolk

No son. It's true, the mistress is unwell; but she has a sickness of the spirit. One day when you are older I will explain it to you.

Rupert

She was fine when I saw her.

Norfolk

What, when have you seen her?

Rupert

She called for me.

He sees the dwarf in the doorway calling him and looks back towards the boy.

Go find Lady Brunswick, I believe she is in the chapel. Tell her to meet me here.

Rupert

Father, do I have to?

Norfolk

Now, at once boy,

Rupert looks as if he could cry but does as he is told. Norfolk follows the dwarf back to the side chamber.

Norfolk

Sir, your appearance startles me.

Magus

Silence!

Norfolk

Sir.

Magus

We will now go to the demon's room and I will entrance it with this symbol.

The magus holds up the book and shows Norfolk the pentagram on its front.

Norfolk

Then I shall grab her...

Magus

SILENCE, Man! I will entrance the demon with this symbol and my friends here will lead it to that place.

He points the sword at the triangle that now sits between the East and West burners.

Before we bring her let me place a sprig of misletoe at the East.

Norfolk

Why on earth is all that necessary?

Magus

You are trying my patience Sir. I must be in the right frame of mind to do this properly and your scepticism is ruining my concentration. Now, for the last time, the misletoe represents the element of Air, in the West I want a bowl of water placed, in the South a candle must burn and in the north they are placing a mound of earth.

Norfolk

Forgive my ignorance Sire, I can see you and your helpers know what you are doing and I will allow you to continue.

Magus

Good, when we bring the girl to this place I will enter the circle with one of my people, him, that one there.

He points the sword at one of the dwarfs who bows slightly to acknowledge the selection.

My other helper will then withdraw from this chamber with you and shall remain outside to ensure no one enters. This is the most important instruction I shall give you. Once the chamber is sealed, no matter what you hear, no matter what you see, the door must remain sealed until I, and I alone open it. Do you understand?

Norfolk

Yes, but...

The Magus raises his index finger to his lips and Norfolk understands to stay quiet.

Magus

Let the ceremony begin.

Scene 35 Int Night

The door to Mary's room is thrown open and the Magus enters holding the book forwards in his right hand and the sword in the left. Mary who is tied to the bed sits up as Norfolk and the two dwarfs follow the Magus.

Mary

What have we here?

Magus

Silence!

He steps closer and pushes the pentagram into her face.

Te exorcizo per die omipotentis vertuem qui regnat per saecula SAECULERUM!

Mary

What are you doing to me.

The dwarfs slit her bindings and take her on each side dragging her from the bed towards the door.

Magus

In nomibus Mertalliae, Musaliae, Dophaliae, Numaliae Zitansiae, segliaton primeuraton AMON!

They drag Mary through the door and into the next chamber, she screams as she is pushed across the room and into the triangle. One of the dwarfs enters the circle with the Magus and the other guides Norfolk out through the door before closing it. Locking Mary, the Magus and his helper in the chamber alone.

Ateth, Ve Gedulah, Ve Gebulah, Malkuth Le Ol ahm, AMON

Outside the window a dark cloud crosses the full moon while a strange dark atmosphere covers the house.

Mary

What games are these old man?

Magus

SILENCE, Yod, He, Vau He!

Their eyes are drawn to the open window as a black cat sits there observing the events unfolding before it. The magus opens his book and points the sword into each of the rooms cardinal points marked with the incense burners.

(To the south) _Australis Adonia tzaboath._

(To the West) _Occidens Eh Ei He_

(To the North) _Borealis Agla_

(To the East _Orens Yod He Vau HE!_

A silence befalls the room and only the girl's heavy breathing can be heard, across the growing mist caused by the burning incense the Magus looks and sees her eyes burning red.

He lifts the bell and hands it to his helper before striking it 24 times.

Nescio quis sim necio unde veniam, Nescio quo quaero sed quid nescio...

Mary (Her voice sounding like a mans)

Now I recognise you, I fought you once before.

Magus

Silence DEMON!

Mary

Let me tell you about a child I met recently, such a small creature, frail and blond, an imp. I took delight in eating that child, sucked it's little bone clean. It was the best ass I ever ate.

Magus

Shut up demon.

Mary

Excubitorres in nominee Gabriele, fas mihi tangere limina illia...

Magus

(He hold up his sword and points it towards her)

Silence demon.

Mary

You think that thing scares me, how about this....

Her form changes into a huge black raven which flutters above the triangle trying to escape its power. The dwarf shakes with terror as the demonic bird attempts to break out but an unseen force holds it back.

Magus

My scrouge, give it to me.

The dwarf takes the calf leather whip and hands the handle to the magus who cracks it against the air, the tails of the whip crack like thunder . The bird recoils in fear of the noise.

Ateth, Ve Gedulah, Ve Gebulah Le Olahm, Malkuth Amon

The bird returns to Mary's form and she lays her palms flat towards the side of the triangle; a forked tongue hissing from between her lips.

Then finding she cannot leave it her form changes once again into that of a royal boy wearing the emblems of rule. A crown is balanced on his head and on his hand he holds out the ring of state.

Mary

I am Edward, your King. Do you recognise me?

Magus

SILENCE DEMON!

Mary

As your King I demand that you release me from this cell.

MAGUS

**(To the dwarf)** My Pentagram

The dwarf hands the magus the book and he displays the star on the cover.

Silence, I compel you to silence.

The form reverts back to Mary

By the names of power I command that you show your true form Demon. Away with these visions, I know who you are and compel you to show yourself.

Mary

**Taking the form of a small naked child, in its left hand a small serpent coils)** I am here master, look it is me, the child you saved as a lad from the rock in the ocean. I have returned to thank you, come release me from this cell.

Magus

Show your true form damn you!

He looks at the child's hand.

Now I see it.

Mary

What do you see.

Magus

There, in your hand. It is a serpent. By the names of Raphael, Michael, Gabreal, Urieal, Chamael, Haniael, atgue ZEDKIAEL!

Show your true form.

Mary

(Taking the form of a young nymph being washed by a rogue wave)

It is me, master, I am not here to tempt you, it is me, your dead wife. Remember the fruits of my groin and how sweet they tasted. Come join me here and let me comfort you...

Magus

Lizabeth, is that you?

Mary

Yes master, you see, this is the scar I got the day I fell from grace, come see it closer....

She pulls back her damp hair and exposes a small scar just below her breast. The magus starts to stutter and steps towards the vision. The dwarf sees this and stands before him ringing the bell loudly.

The magus shakes his head as the sound of ringing brings him from his trance like state.

Magus

Thank you small friend.

Mary hisses and regains her form again as the cat jumps from the window cell and starts to walk around the circle.

TAKE YOU TRUE FORM DEMON, SHOW YOURSELF!

Scene 36 Int NIGHT

Thunder peels echo about the halls outside the room as Norfolk paces up and down, suddenly the sound of footfalls approach out of the darkness and Lady Brunswick approaches holding a candle accompanied by the guard.

Lady Brunswick

Lord Norfolk, Rupert has only told me that you have returned. I am so thankful, terrible things have happened since you left, poor Lady Gardener, she....

A loud scream comes from behind the door guarded by the dwarf.

What is going on in there and who is this strange little person? Have you seen the mistress yet?

Norfolk

I have seen her, she is in there, beyond that door with a brave wise man who attempts to cure her.

Lady Brunswick

It sounds like her is killing her, open this door at once.

Norfolk

The Mistress is already dead. Don't you understand, she is already dead. If the man in that room cannot bring her back to us we will have lost her forever.

Lady Brunswick

She is dead?

Norfolk

The woman we know and love has been killed and her body stolen by an interloper, a demon. If we allow this man to continue she may yet be saved.

Lady Brunswick

So do you know about Lady Gardener?

Norfolk looks at the guard who in turn looks away coyly. Norfolk sniffs and puts his shoulders back before addressing the Lady once again.

Norfolk

Of course, we know our mistress would never harm anyone, let alone a woman she has known all her life, the wife of her dearest friend. We must accept that a demon has been responsible for all the awful things done recently, that Mary, our friend and Queen may be lost forever, this is our last chance at saving her.

Scene 37 Int Night

On the other side of the door the ritual continues.

Magus

Show your true form demon. Show that we have met before.

Mary

(Taking the form of a young girl in a field of barley)

It's true I am your sister. I am here, my dearest brother, come join me in this fragrant field as you did when we were small children.

Magus

Stop playing these games, I COMPEL YOU!

Monstrum e locis summis abi niunc oculis meis.

He nods to his helper who bangs the bell a further nine times.

By the Great and Powerful name of Yod, He, Vau, He, let the shining one lose his power over thee.

He takes a small vial of oil from the table and opens the top and begins spraying it towards the cowering form held in the triangle.

I have purified thee and your heart is full of joy, having anointed thee with oils and made you strong I now Supplicate thee, I supplicate thee, I SUPLICATE THEE!

The is a strange stirring in the room and even the cat who has sat quietly up to this point begins to run around the circle madly. The girl screams and bangs the hidden force keeping her locked in the confines of the triangle.

Take your true form demon, take it and face me.

Mary's eyes turn black and her head deforms into an oblong, her neck expands and scales appear over her skin, then she elongates and becomes a huge winged snake that towers over the Magus and his helper. The snake tries to escape its cage and it's gruesome fangs drip with blood.

Mary

SSSSSSSSSSSSSo, you have what you desire old man, to conversssssssssse with a demon......

Magus

Would you not like to escape from the prison I have constructed for you?

Mary

You can't keep me here forever......

The snake swoops down snapping at the two men.

Magus

My scrouge, quickly

The dwarf takes the calf whip and places it in his master's hand. The magus cracks it against the air and the snake recoils in horror. Again he cracks the scrouge trying to frighten the creature but the snake manages to bite the end of the whip and a terrible Tug of War begins.

Quick, my dagger, faster....

The dwarf turns and takes the dagger from the top of the table. The magus is about to be pulled out of the circle when the dagger is slipped between the fingers of his free hand. He uses it to cut the fronds of the whip and falls back against the table.

The Magus turns and takes his up book once again, placing the dagger down and lifting the sword with his free hand, he turns holding the silver pentagram towards the demon.

I supplicate thee demon.

Mary

Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssuplication.....

Magus

DO YOU WANT TO ESCAPT THE TRIANGLE OR NO?

Mary

Ssssssssssssssssso, you offer me freedom, what do you wissssssssssssssssh in return?

Magus

Leave this girl and set yourself free in the body of this beast.

He points his sword at the cat. The snake hisses and tries again to escape. Then it turns into a cloud of green vapour that tries to slip out of the triangle.

If I hold the tail of this beast and push its head into your cell you can take its body. Then, in the body of that beast, you will be able to run from here, be free in the world of men. Hear me demon, you will be a free creature, free to roam though out this world. To cross the earth and the ocean, imprisoned only by your imagination.

The green vapour turns into the form of Mary once again, her eyes black and tongue forked.

Mary

You would do that for me?

Magus

Not for you, I do it for the girl you possess. Come Guland, demon of chaos; I demand it in _your name_. For Guland be your true name, or is it Rahu today? For you take many names in many cultures.

Think demon, never again will you have to dwell in the realm of spirits, waiting for a poor soul to invite you into this material world. You will be fee to go where and do what thy wilt; tell me demon, what price freedom?

Mary

Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssss, I agree, all you want is the body of this mortal?

Magus

The living body, I want you to leave her as you found her. I ask again GULAND, what price freedom?

A terrible wind blows through the room and all the furnishings are taken up by it. The sound of wolves howling at the moon splits the night air as the demon hisses behind its triangle cage.

Mary

Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssss, take the beast's tail and give me the brain.

Magus

And you will allow the girl to live?

Mary

I agree.

The Magus reaches out and grabs the cat's tail and attempts to pull it into the circle. The cat screams a sound that would unlock the gates of hell and digs its claws into the wooden floor, pulling against the Magus.

The magus manoeuvres the cat so it is facing Mary and slowly allows the animal to pull itself forwards until its head enters the triangle.

There is a sudden flash of lightening and a blinding light fills the room, a clap of thunder peels out and all is shaken by the sound.

In the flashing light the Magus sees Mary fall to the ground and the cats eyes turn as black as night.

He pulls it from the triangle and then raises his sword high above his head. Another flash of lightening illuminates the room and the blade glints brightly; it then swoops down in a perfect arch and meets the cats head just above the shoulder.

The cat's head flies off its body and spins through the air as if in slow motion, a spray of deep red blood following its trajectory before falling and staining the wooden floorboards.

The room goes deadly quiet and only the sound of the Magus's heavy breathing fills the room.

He places the bloody sword upon the table and kisses it gently before falling to his knees and offering a prayer to his God.

Magus

Ateth, Malkuth, Ve Gedulah, Ve Gebulah, Le Olem Amon.

He wipes a tear from his eyes and sighs gently. Then turning to the dwarf the Magus nods at the cat.

Burn it, burn it now in the fire there. Go on, it is safe for you to leave the circle.

The dwarf furtively leaves the circle and picks the cats body up by its tail and tosses it into the incense burner followed by the head.

The girl, check she is breathing.

The dwarf kneels beside Mary and listens to her chest, he smiles at the old man as rays of bright sunlight appear over the distant horizon, the sound of birdcalls split the air and summer appears to have come again filling the room with warm dawn light.

The Magus stands unsteadily and walks to the South cardinal point and blows out the flame. Looking out the window and seeing the rising sun in the distance a small smile appears on his face.

Thank you Ra, Holy Mithras; for protecting me from the darkness, I knew I could trust you. How many more times must your rays chase Set into the abyss?

He takes up the bell and walks around the circle muttering a banishing ritual to cleanse the room before ringing the bell a further nine times. Then he goes to the door and opens it. Norfolk and Lady Brunswick run in and look at the scene.

Lady Brunswick crosses herself and looks at the old man in his costume as if he himself were a devil.

Lady Brunswick

What manner of evil has been going on here?

Magus

Quiet woman, go to your mistress, be thankful that she has been saved.

Lady Brunswick goes to Mary who is just opening her eyes, they look bright and well, she looks at lady Brunswick and smiles.

Mary

I seem to have fallen.

Lady Brunswick

Let me help you madam, you are all right now, I see it in your eyes.

Mary

I have been ill?

Lady Brunswick

No Mistress, just sleeping. Thank God we have you back.

Mary

I had the strangest dream.

Lady Brunswick

Oh, tell me later when I have tucked you into your bed, first let me get you ready to eat. You must be hungry?

Mary

Famished, I am starving.

Lady Brunswick

Good Girl, we will take good care of you, come, this way.

Norfolk

I am truly amazed. You have done a good job kind Sire, are you feeling yourself?

Magus

I need to change out of my robes, then to bath and then I have a long journey home.

Norfolk

Surely you will want to stay and eat with us tonight, I want to tell every one of your powers and introduce you to some very important people.

Magus

Never. You must never speak of me Lord. My work here must be our secret.

Norfolk

What?

Magus

These are dangerous times and people who are deemed different are not treated well. You must keep what I have done to yourself.

Norfolk

If that is what you want.

Magus

It is.

Norfolk

A payment then; perhaps I could give you gold for your trouble?

Magus

While I am changing you may cross the palms of my helpers with some silver, moon metal; they would appreciate that.

Norfolk

Anything you wish, moon metal, I have heard that phrase once before, in the forest.

Magus

Go and let me change, I am tired and do not enjoy idle talk.

Norfolk

Anything you wish Sire....

Scene 38 Int dusk.

The Magus and Norfolk are walking through the house to the court yard and his coach which has been loaded. Along the way Lady Brunswick approaches and hands the old man a spray of summer flowers.

Lady Brunswick

For you kind Sir, the mistress bathed and is now eating in her room. We owe you a debt. The country owes you a debt.

Magus

You owe me nothing, dear woman. Neither does the country.

Norfolk

Are you sure you won't take my gold. It is the least I feel I can do.

Magus

If you wish to give gold away give it to the starving old women in the cities, or those valiant soldiers who risk their lives for this royal house. Give it to the poor children who wander its lanes and byways shoeless and hungry. Those who idle in poverty in this rich realm need your gold more than I, give it to them.

Norfolk

As you wish, I will make plans for charity so that all the country can celebrate the crowning of a new queen and a return to the old religion. I hope you will join us in London next week for the Coronation?

Magus

Bhhh! Religion, it is the cause of so much suffering and dispute. Why would I celebrate that? Beside, I am the king of my own realm and I am needed there. Give the lady my regards and advise her well when she takes the crown.

Be sure to protect her from the malevolent forces that are at work on this Earthly plane in future. Remember they can be stirred by the wilful sacrifice of another human.

Norfolk

I will. No more burnings, I can promise you that.

They step from the house and into the courtyard. The magus smiles seeing the coach is tethered to Norfolk's horse.

Well, how else will your coach move? Take the horse as a token of my satisfaction.

Magus

Thank you kind Lord Norfolk. Goodbye and remember to speak of this to no one.

Norfolk

What if you are needed her again?

The magus climbs aboard the coach and the dwarfs flick the reigns making the horse lurch forwards. The old man looks out the window and smiles.

Magus

I will see it written in the stars.

Norfolk

There goes a great man.

Scene 39 Int Night

Norfolk enters Mary's room and finds a maid attending to her pillows. He looks at the girl who curtsies and leaves.

Mary

Who was that strange man I saw earlier.

Norfolk

Oh, just a friend. How are you dear mistress?

Mary

I am fine, what is wrong with everyone today treating me like I am an invalid. What news from London, tell me, I am eager for information.

Norfolk

Tomorrow we will make a procession such as the city has never seen before. I will instruct a marching band and drummers and banner wavers all the way from Hampton Court. The city will know once and for always that you are to succeed Edward. Even your sister Elizabeth is coming here to join us.

Mary

Oh, what of Jayne?

Norfolk

Once the crown is placed on your head you can exile her, in the meantime let us get to London and take control of our government. When that has been done she can be sent to the tower until we have secured and consolidated our power.

Mary

Good, you have things well in hand my Lord. When that crown is mine I will make as my first order a release of Pole, Gardener and Bonner. I will burn that Book of Common Prayer and then round up those responsible for the heresy.

The night sky will glow red with my vengeance; the world will have never seen such a fire as the one I intend to light under the Anglican Churches.

Norfolk

Is that wise mistress?

Mary

Don't be coy, my Lord. We must be brave now on this eve of our success. Just watch Lord Norfolk; a new age is about to begin. God has ordained it.

Scene 40 Ext day

We see crowds of people waving and cheering at Mary's procession reaches the gates of the great city. She is seated behind a guard of a hundred men on the golden state coach. Beside her sits the teenage Elizabeth and both wave from their respective windows.

Norfolk rides proudly behind the coach in full military costume, a guild sword at his side.

Suddenly the crowd surge forwards, his horse neighs loudly and kicks. Norfolk brings the animal under control seeing Mary watching intently from the window of her coach.. Her eyes black, a forked tongue darting between her red lips.

Mary's reign was the bloodiest in history, having released the catholic bishops and Lady Gardener's husband Steven, imprisoned by Edward she then dealt with Lady Jayne Grey, who after nine months confinement was executed on Tower Hill.

No less then 300 men, women and children were burned at her orders as part of the religious persecution she instigated now known as the Marian Persecutions. These began over a period of five days in early 1555.

Queen Mary was eaten alive during her short five-year reign by a malevolent cancer that prevented her from having children and leaving a catholic heir and legacy; the crown passing to protestant Elizabeth upon her death.

She is remembered forever as 'Bloody Mary'

The End.
