PROLOGUE

SETTING:

The small rural city of Kimberly in southeast British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1990s when the lead-zinc mining industry was still in full flourish and the town was booming with life with tourists. Kimberly, BC was named to be the 'Bavarian City of the Rockies' to motorists passing through the region onto the tri-city urban areas of metro-vancouver.

EXT. KIMBERLY SCHOOL

The year is 1997 and it was just another sunny morning in small town of Kimberly, British Columbia. The camera zooms past a newspaper stand which displays the headline 'Sullivan Mine prospers and attracts more people to Kimberly'. The morning dew glistens in the morning sunlight in front of a large brick building. The bricks are dull red and the building looks slightly aged. There is a playground full of children playing all sorts of games that regular school children play.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER)

The one thing we should know about ourselves is that we all have a story inside of us just waiting to be let out. Each story is special and we all hold it very dear to our hearts. If you haven't guessed already, this story is called life and it is more complicated, more touching, and more beautifully simple than anything that can ever be written by the greatest story tellers. My story starts in my hometown of Kimberly, a small mining community in the heart of British Columbia and it begins on that day that everyone can remember, the first day of school.

A familiar ringing bell is heard throughout the playground and the children start streaming into the large building. We catch a glimpse of the name of the building, it says in large bronze letters: KIMBERLY SCHOOL. We also see a small dirty pickup truck pull up in front of the school entrance. A couple gets out of the car, followed by a small boy. Another man, around 40-ish years old and bald, goes up to the truck and takes the small boy by the hand. We are not close enough to hear what is happening but we can see this bald man motioning for the couple to walk with him. The woman starts to go but the man grabs her by the arm and motions her back into the truck. He says a few words to the bald man and then he gets into the truck and drives away.

END SCENE.

INT. KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM (JUST AFTER RECESS)

We are inside a typical kindergarten classroom, with the morning light streaming in from large paned glass windows. The calming yellow paint of the walls is barely visible from the myriad of children's paintings stuck on the walls. There are small tables and chairs all of different colors scattered throughout the room. The room is filled with little children all over the place finger painting new paintings for the teacher to post around the classroom. The camera zooms in onto a small blond Caucasian girl proudly holding her painting up to her teacher, middle aged slim build brunette slightly tanned woman.

TEACHER

Wow, Suzy! This is amazing! This is going right up on the wall! (reaches out and holds up the painting to the classroom) Look class, we have another beautiful painting! And this one is by our very own Suzy!

Suzy returns to hear seat with a big smile on her face. She pulls out another piece of paper and dips her right hand into a pot of orange paint. The teacher begins to look in her desk for some Scotch tape, when she hears a knocking at the door. At the door is the principal, a stocky but friendly looking bald man and next to him stands a small brunette boy. He seems maybe 7 or 8 years old, and is very shy as he is holding the principal's hand and looking intently at his shoes, which are slightly undone.

PRINCIPAL

Karen, hello Karen. How are you?

TEACHER

Oh hello Patrick. I'm doing well, and the children are drawing such beautiful paintings today (she holds up the painting that she received from Suzy)

PRINCIPAL

Wow, that's amazing. Don't you think the painting is amazing, Dylan?

The small boy (DYLAN) looks up gingerly from his feet and slowly looks at the painting. We can see his eyes light up and a small smile forms.

TEACHER

Do you like finger painting, Dylan? (DYLAN nods and takes her hand) Are the parents around, I'd like to see them. And it'll be good for Dylan to at least see them around since this is his first day. Plus it'll be rewarding for them.

PRINCIPAL

I'm sorry, Karen. They just dropped him off in the morning. They both seem like very busy folk. It's not really my place to say but -- (Notices Dylan and says to DYLAN) Why don't you go play with the children, Dylan? I'm sure you're anxious to start finger painting.

TEACHER

Yes, Dylan, why don't you sit right here beside Amber?

Dylan sits on his desk and the teacher hands him a fresh black piece of paper. She heads off outside the classroom with the principal. She seems to have a slightly stern look on her face. Dylan sits still with his hands in his pockets and looks around at the other children seated at the table. They are busy painting, laughing and having fun. The girl (AMBER) sitting beside Dylan first notices that he isn't doing anything. She has short strawberry blonde hair.

YOUNG AMBER

Don't you know how to paint?

Dylan looks at her shyly and confused.

YOUNG AMBER

Here, let me show you. You put your hand in here (She grabs Dylan's hand and pushed it into a small pot of green paint) and then you put your hand here (she pushes Dylan's hand across the blank paper making a bright streak of green). See it's easy, except you do it.

Dylan looks at her, smiling and obviously excited to be able to paint. He starts to paint more green lines around the streak of green that Amber helped him paint. Dylan reaches for some yellow paint and accidentally knocks some paint onto Amber's painting.

YOUNG AMBER

Hey!

Dylan looks at it and using his finger he draws a slightly misshapen yellow circle with a little happy face inside that almost looks like a smiling sun. Ambers beams a radiant smile.

YOUNG AMBER

I wanna do one too! (She grabs some yellow paint and begins to draw on Dylan's paper. It doesn't look anything like Dylan's smiling yellow sun and Dylan smiles)

Amber notices Dylan's smile and she smiles even brighter. They both begin to feverishly paint all over each other's paintings, both giggling and laughing.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER)

And that moment to this day is still my most precious memory. Amber and I became the best of friends after that. We would tell each other our closest secrets, we would always know the right things to say to make each other feel better, and together we always brought out the best in ourselves. And we stayed best friends, year after year, no matter what life threw at us. Of course, life is a funny thing. It has its ups, and its downs. I remember when my life started to really go to hell...

END SCENE.

ACT I

EXT. KIMBERLY SCHOOL SOFTBALL FIELD – EARLY MORNING

The sun still hasn't reached its peak in the sky and is casting long shadows across the field. Everything on the vast field lay serene; the dirt on the pitcher's mound and around the diamond lay in a perfect shape, as if hiding the years of softball games played on them, and the grass still wet from the first rain of the spring sway silently to an invisible occasional wind. The silence is suddenly broken by two people running through the field. One of them is a slim brunette boy about 17 years old (TEENAGE DYLAN). He is wearing a blue baseball cap and is wearing a light blue softball jersey. The other is a cute girl with long strawberry blonde hair about 15 years old (TEENAGE AMBER) and she is wearing short sunshine yellow skirt that flows in the wind as she runs alongside the boy.

TEENAGE DYLAN

(huffing) Amber, I dunno how you convinced me to wake up so early just so I can run around on the softball field

TEENAGE AMBER

Trust me, Dylan; I'm on the track team. This will improve your running. And I've seen you run, you're pretty pathetic.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Oh thanks a lot, you're such a great motivator.

TEENAGE AMBER

(laughs) okay, after this last lap we'll get to throwing, and then you're hitting, and then –

TEENAGE DYLAN

I've been running for 45 minutes, and it's only like the fourth game. Nobody is expected to great four games into the season.

TEENAGE AMBER

Yeah, but you suck at softball. I'm just trying to help you not suck at tomorrow's game.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Once again, thank you for your great words of inspiration.

TEENAGE AMBER

I'll let you rest if you can beat me to home plate (and with that she takes off towards home plate)

TEENAGE DYLAN

Wha— (sees her running, and starts racing her to home plate)

Dylan and Amber both race for home plate. The grass and dirt fly off of Dylan's cleats as he tries to make up his distance to Amber. We can see Dylan barely beats her there. Dylan bends over with his hands on his knees gasping for air.

TEENAGE AMBER

(huffing) See, you're getting better. Two weeks ago, you couldn't have beaten me. (Dylan still gasping for air; She picks up a pair of softball mitts and throws one at Dylan, who fumbles it and it hits the ground) You're catching game still needs work.

TEENAGE AMBER

So are your parents coming to see you play tomorrow?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Well, my mom is going to be busy at the hospital. She's a nurse, so it's really hard for her to leave work. But she made my dad promise to come this time.

TEENAGE AMBER

That's great.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Yeah...I don't think my dad really likes me that much...

TEENAGE AMBER

Why not?

TEENAGE DYLAN

He never really talks to me.

TEENAGE AMBER

Well, he's coming to your game; it shows that he cares right?

TEENAGE DYLAN

No, he's only coming because my mom made him. They had such a big fight over it yesterday. My mom was shouting and my dad was shouting, I was in my room drawing and trying to ignore them but it wasn't working. Do your parents fight too?

TEENAGE AMBER

Yeah but not all the time. Usually my dad wants to do something but my mom will disagree and they'll kinda talk about it.

TEENAGE DYLAN

They don't shout at each other?

TEENAGE AMBER

(thinks) I don't think I've ever heard them shouting...

TEENAGE DYLAN

Oh... (looks sad)

TEENAGE AMBER

Is something wrong at home?

TEENAGE DYLAN

(She rubs his arm and he slightly winces) No...

TEENAGE AMBER

(Lifts up Dylan's sleeve) Dylan, you're hurt-

TEENAGE DYLAN

It's nothing...I fell and bruised...throw me the ball, Amber.

Dylan picks up the bat and is trying to bunt the ball as Amber throws it at him. Amber is laughing at his several lame attempts at hitting the ball.

END SCENE.

EXT. WALKING THROUGH A TRAIL IN THE TREES

After the workout, Dylan is walking Amber home. She lives relatively close by but they have to walk through a trail in the forest. As they are walking, streaks of sunlight (from the sun which has risen just past its highest peak in the sky) scatter through the tall trees. Birds are singing in the air and there is a very slight occasional wind.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Thanks a lot for helping me out with my game.

TEENAGE AMBER

Can I ask you a favor?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Sure, anything.

TEENAGE AMBER

Please stop thanking me every single day for helping you with your game. Or I'll have to start thanking you for walking me home after practice every day.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Well you could thank me for walking you home (Amber looks at him in a fake shocked face) You're welcome (Dylan laughs as Amber punches his softly on the arm)

TEENAGE AMBER

I love walking through this forest. I love hearing all the birds sing and smell the flowers. You must think it's pretty stupid, huh?

TEENAGE DYLAN

(truthfully) No, not at all.

Amber smiles and grabs Dylan's hand and rests her head on his shoulder.

TEENAGE AMBER

Finally, someone who understands me (smiles and giggles)

Dylan hesitates for a brief moment but then smiles. She lifts her head and she smiles back at him. They continue to hold hands.

TEENAGE AMBER

Do you ever think about stuff?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Of course I think about stuff, what do you mean?

TEENAGE AMBER

(blushes at her stupid statement) I mean the future.

TEENAGE DYLAN

I dunno, I've never really thought too much about it. What about you?

TEENAGE AMBER

I've always thought about what it would be like to get out of this town. I'd like to see the world and all the amazing things the travelers passing through the town tell us about.

TEENAGE DYLAN

It all sounds so complicated and mysterious to me. I'm not fond of new things. I'd rather just stay here with the people I know.

TEENAGE AMBER

Ooohh, is there anyone in particular I should know about? Does Dylan have a crush one someone? (giggling)

TEENAGE DYLAN

(hesitates) No...

TEENAGE AMBER

Oh! You do! I can tell! Who is it?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Nobody.

TEENAGE AMBER

You know I can tell whenever you're lying to me. You start to blush.

TEENAGE DYLAN

(Stammering) No-body, seriously.

They continue on down the path towards Amber's house holding hands.

END SCENE

EXT. MR. PETERSON'S BOATHOUSE

Just outside of the forest, there is a small lake that runs from Kimberly further into the interior of British Columbia. There is a small cabin located just along the coastline of the lake, with a long wooden pier that extends out into the lake. We can see several rowing boats tied to the wooden pier, bobbing calmly on the lake. As Dylan comes up closer to the boathouse from emerging from the forest, we can see a chubby elderly man (MR. PETERSON) pop his head out. He sees Dylan walking up to the boathouse, smiles and calls to him.

MR. PETERSON

Afternoon to you, Dylan!

TEENAGE DYLAN

Afternoon to you too, Mr. Peterson.

MR. PETERSON

Have you come to rent out one of my row boats again on this lovely day?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Yes, sir, I have.

MR. PETERSON

Well, sure. Take the red one out by the pier (points to a red row boat) My son was just out on the lake earlier (he opens up the door and steps out with a small boy) Say hello to Dylan, Teddy.

The small boy (TEDDY) stays behind his father but smiles and quietly whispers a 'Hello'

TEENAGE DYLAN

(Smiles back at TEDDY) Hello, Teddy, glad to see you again. He's getting really big, Mr. Peterson, almost everytime I see him.

MR. PETERSON

Yeah, he's a fast grower, a fast eater too, it's no wonder he grows so fast (he disappears inside and then re-emerges with a wooden paddle) Here you go. A word of advice, if you're looking for something really amazing for your paintings, try staying along the right end of the lake. There's a slow current that will take you into a little area with overhanging cherry trees. There in full bloom in early spring, and it's an amazing sight as you'll see.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Thank you, sir. I'll have the boat back by this evening.

MR. PETERSON

Take your time, Dylan.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Thank you, sir.

Dylan grabs the paddle from Mr. Peterson and waves goodbye to Teddy, who waves back shyly. Dylan walks down the pier and unties the red row boat and gingerly steps down onto it and begins to paddle away. He turns back and waves goodbye to Mr. Peterson, who waves back at him from the pier.

END SCENE.

EXT. OVERHANGING CHERRY TREES ALONG THE LAKE

The camera is with Dylan as the boat gently floats into the small portion of the lake where there are overhanging cherry trees. We can see them from both sides of the tributary (with the water still deep enough to let a small boat through). The great trees extend over the tributary and cast shadows over it, allowing only small streams of sunlight to reach the water. The cherry trees are in full bloom and filled with small pink cherry petals. The petals leap softly into the air with each invisible breeze and float gently into the water, creating a carpet of pink petals along the surface of the water. Dylan watches this unfold in amazement from the row boat.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S HOUSE

Dylan opens the door and walks in, he is still smiling from the boat ride earlier. His mother comes out of the kitchen to intercept him in the hallway.

DYLAN'S MOTHER (AMANDA)

(Quietly) Shhh, your father's asleep. Be careful and don't wake him. I made you a sandwich, eat it in your room and try not to make any loud sounds. (She hands him a plate with a sandwich)

Dylan takes the plate in one hand, and slowly walks up the stairs. He looks down at his father, who is sleeping passed out in the couch in the living room. There is a half empty beer bottle in his hand, which is just dangling off the edge of the couch and several other empty beer bottles around him on the floor.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S ROOM

Dylan turns on the light switch as he walks into his room. Dylan's room is a slight mess, with some clothes scattered along the floor and some on the edge of his bed, although his bed is neatly made up. There is a small telescope just adjacent to the single window, pointed up towards the sky. Adjacent to some astronomy books next to his desk, there is an open sketchbook on the edge of the desk and we can see amazing art sketches of natural landscapes. There are more sketches on the walls except these are in color and some are paintings. We notice a familiar painting taped onto the wall right above his bed: a finger painting, the one with green streaks and a misshapen yellow sun. Dylan puts the sandwich down on his desk and picks up the open sketchbook and flips to a new page. He picks up a few colored pastels/paint brushes and begins to draw out the overhanging cherry tree scene.

He hears a sound from downstairs and freezes. His father is up and we can hear him shouting and his mother is also screaming. All of a sudden we hear a loud crashing sound from downstairs. His mother is screaming a lot more now. Dylan throws his sketchbook onto the bed and runs downstairs and we can still hear the parents shouting and sounds of objects being smashed or thrown.

END SCENE.

EXT. KIMBERLY SCHOOL SOFTBALL FIELD – NEXT DAY LATE AFTERNOON ~5 PM

The sun is shining down on the two teams are out on the softball field. One team is playing the field and they are in red jerseys. The other team is at bat and they are in light blue jerseys. There is a boy at bat and he looks a bit nervous. He is a slim teenage boy who would look out of place playing any kind of sport. He looks up at the score clock and sees that it's the last inning of the game and the teams are tied with 3 runs each and the opposing team already had one out. The batter looks at the pitcher who looks back menacingly. The boy looks past and sees his teammate on third looking back at him. He is screaming something at him. All of a sudden it seems like the sound of the crowd becomes audible to him.

TEAMMATE ON THIRD

C'mon, Dylan!

TEENAGE DYLAN looks back at the coach who signals him by touching his nose with his index finger. Dylan nods, he understands what that means, and he looks back at the pitcher and raises the bat.

UMPIRE

Play ball!

CATCHER

(Whispers to Dylan) You're gonna strike out, loser. Two down, just one more to miss...

Dylan pretends to ignore the catcher and focuses on the ball. The pitcher winds up and throws the ball at him. Dylan cradles the bat, predicting its trajectory, and then bunts the ball between the pitcher and first base. Dylan begins to run towards first base, as his teammate runs towards home plate. Unfortunately, the bunt wasn't great and the pitcher, almost reading the play, steps quickly towards the left to intercept the ball. Swiftly, he picks it up and shovels it towards the catcher who grabs it midair and tag the running player.

UMPIRE

OUT!

Dylan looks back while running to see his teammate being called out. The catcher swings the ball towards first in an attempt to get Dylan out for the double play. The ball flies over Dylan's head, as his heart drops, as the first baseman opens his glove to catch the ball. Almost by chance, the ball is thrown too high and the first baseman has to jump to reach for the ball and misses. Dylan seizes this opportunity and runs towards second. He can see his coach run off the bench screaming at him to run like he's never run before. The right outfielder seeing the play develop comes in to try to get Dylan out at second. The right outfielder runs in towards the ball, which sits just maybe 10 feet past first base, picks it up and swings it towards second just as Dylan gets close. Dylan, in a last ditch effort, jumps and slides towards second and reaches it just as the ball is caught by the second baseman. Dylan's breathes a sigh of relief as the resonating sound of SAFE! and the cheers of the crowd. He gets up and dust his pants.

The second baseman throws the ball back to the pitcher, who still looks menacingly at Dylan. One of this teammates has come up to bat, and the crowd begins to cheer. Dylan edges slightly off second base. The pitcher takes a look at Dylan but decides not to throw to catch him cheating towards third. Instead, the pitcher drives a fast ball towards home plate.

UMPIRE

STEERRR-IIKEEE ONE!

Dylan taps second base with his foot and resumes his position slightly towards third base. Once again, the pitcher looks but decides not to throw towards him to catch him cheating. Dylan looks at his coach and can see him slightly motioning towards him. The pitcher winds up and throws a curve ball, and Dylan takes off. The batter swings but doesn't make contact with that ball. The catcher grips the ball, rises up to see Dylan running towards third, and hurls the ball towards the third baseman. Dylan, already doing so once before, takes another head first dive towards the base and arrives there just before the ball this time.

UMPIRE

SAFE! He's safe! (looks back at the pitcher) That's two strikes, let's play ball!

The pitcher looks at Dylan, he looks slightly worried, but shakes that look off his face. Dylan looks out into the crowd and sees a familiar face. A cute strawberry blonde teenage girl is sitting not too far away from him, she sees him and smiles and waves back. Dylan smiles back at her. The pitcher looks back at the batter, intently and with increased focus. The pitcher then leans back, winds up, and throws another fast ball towards home plate. The batter swings and crack! He makes contact with the ball and it curves right past Dylan past third base. It's a low ground ball and Dylan takes off towards home.

The balls rolls around the boards of the left outfield and one of the opposing team players picks it up to throw but it is too late. Dylan has already past home plate and the game is over. The crowd erupts in cheers and Dylan's teammates engulf him. Dylan escapes his teammates who begin to congratulate the batter whose hit allowed Dylan to reach home plate. He begins to collect his things and walks out of the bench area. Outside is the same girl with strawberry blonde hair that smiled at him earlier. She walks towards him excited with her now long hair waving in the air and gives him a big hug.

TEENAGE AMBER

Wow, that was amazing!

TEENAGE DYLAN

Hey Amber (laughs) Thanks but watch out, I'm a little dirty and I don't want you to ruin your dress.

TEENAGE AMBER

(Laughs back) Since when am I afraid to get a little messy?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Thanks for helping me with my hitting. Although I still need some work.

TEENAGE AMBER

You were fine, just keep practicing. Maybe you can come over again and we'll go over it some more?

Dylan looks past her and sees his father feverishly motioning to him.

TEENAGE DYLAN

I'll probably have to see if I can come by later. Looks my dad needs me for something. I'll catch you later.

TEENAGE AMBER

(Sadly) okay, later Dylan.

Dylan leaves her and runs towards his dad (CHARLIE) who is standing beside the pickup truck.

DYLAN'S FATHER (CHARLIE)

Get in, I have to get to work and I need to drop you off.

TEENAGE DYLAN

That's ok, I can walk home, and it's not too far from here.

CHARLIE

(Sternly) I promised your mother I would drive you home and I don't need her on my case about something else. So get in the truck.

Dylan looks back at Amber, and waves goodbye. She waves back. Dylan throws his equipment in the bed and gets into the truck and they drive away. The drive home is quiet.

END SCENE

EXT. DYLAN'S HOME

Still afternoon but maybe more around ~6 PM.

The truck pulls up in the driveway of a small two story house. The house has a coat of dull yellow paint, with white window panes and a white fence, with slightly peeling paint. The lawn hasn't been tended to for a while and the green grass is about a foot high and there is a lone tree adjacent to the house in the front yard with a worn out tire leaning up against it. Dylan gets out of the truck and it pulls away from the driveway. Dylan picks up his stuff from the back as the truck pulls away down the road. Dylan walks past the lawn into the front door, and its squeaks shut behind him.

END SCENE

INT. DYLAN'S HOME

Dylan places his softball stuff in the hallway and takes off his dirty shoes. A call comes from inside the house.

DYLAN'S MOTHER (AMANDA)(OFF SCREEN)

Dylan, is that you?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Yeah mom!

AMANDA (OFF SCREEN)

Don't leave your stuff in the hallway! I don't want that dirtying up the floor. Put it in your room! (Dylan picks up his bag and begins to walk up the stairs) Where's your father? Did he drop you?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Yeah, he's gone to work.

AMANDA mutters something from the kitchen but we can't make out what she said. Dylan walks up into his room. It's a slight mess with some socks on the floor and some clothes at the foot of the bed. The afternoon sunlight streams into the room through his window, only slightly impeded by the leaves of the tree that we say in the front yard. He lays his bag down by the door and throws his dirty shirt into a laundry basket. He grabs a white shirt and dark blue jeans from the pile from the foot of bed and goes into the washroom. He comes out momentarily wearing the clothes he grabbed, and threw his dirty softball pants in the laundry bin.

AMANDA (OFF SCREEN)

Dylan, wash up. Dinner's ready.

Dylan exits room and heads downstairs.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S HOUSE – KITCHEN

Dinner is complete and the clock on the wall of the kitchen says it's almost 10 pm. Amanda and Dylan are finishing cleaning the dishes over the sink. There is a small TV playing in the background although there is some static and the reception isn't very great.

TV (BACKGROUD)

...in local news today, the CPR-owned Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada announced that they will laying off mine workers and cease operations of the Sullivan mine...

Amanda stops cleaning the plates and places it on the counter. She turns around and faces the TV and has a very worried look on her face.

TV (CONT'D)

...This comes as a shock to many. The Sullivan mine has employed many workers since its opening in 1917 and will have been in operation for over 90 years pending its closure this year, in the late spring of 2001. Local residents in Kimberly, who rely heavily on the jobs provided by the Sullivan mine, are outraged at this sudden announcement...

TEENAGE DYLAN

Mom, what will happen to Dad? Is he gonna lose his job?

AMANDA

I'm sure we'll be fine, honey. We've gotten through worse situations than this. Just finish the dishes, Dylan. I'll be in the sewing room.

Amanda leaves the kitchen and goes off screen. Dylan continues to watch the TV with a worried expression on his face. The TV reporter is interviewing some of the local residents.

TV

... (Elderly woman talking on the TV) The mine has been in operation for over 90 years and has employed men from three generations of my family. This sudden closure is a rude and shameful act for a company that has such intricate ties with the community here in Kimberly...And here we have Bill Housman, who's been working at the mine for more than 40 years. Sir, what was your reaction to the announcement made earlier today? It's stupid and selfish. What can I do now? (He walks away from the camera) here you have It, just pure simple outrage from people of Kimberly with this sudden and shocking blow to the fragile economy of Kimberly. Back to you, Mike for weather around the province...

Dylan quickly finished cleaning the remaining dishes and puts them beside the sink.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Mom! I'm done, I'm gonna head off to bed.

With that, he goes towards the TV and turns it off before going off screen.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S ROOM 1 AM

The clock alarm beside Dylan's bed rings for only a brief moment before Dylan slams it off. The room is dark and the clock reads 1 am. Slowly Dylan slides off the bed and we can see that he is not dressed in pajamas, but in a shirt and jeans. He gingerly steps around his room and pulls on his jacket. He grabs the sketchbook from his desk, and pulls out a small thermos from under his bed, and puts them both inside a small backpack before carefully putting it on his back. He gently pushes his telescope aside and opens his window, pauses only for a brief moment when the window creaks making sure that his parents were not aware of the noise, and then completes to open the window. He steps out into the window and grabs a hold of one of the larger branches of the tree adjacent to his room and casually climbs down and disappears into the night.

END SCENE.

EXT. AMBER'S HOUSE – ABOUT 3 AM

The night is dark without the moon in the sky but is filled with millions of twinkling stars. We see a small two story house right outside of the dark forest that is very similar to Dylan's house. But it has bright yellow walls (although its very hard to tell in the dark) but is without a white picket fence and tree in the front yard. Dylan walks towards the house and looks down on the gravel and picks up a few small pebbles. He walks into the backyard and he looks up into the second story window. There is a trellis (structure usually made from interwoven wood pieces, attached to the roof or exterior walls made to support a climbing plant) just underneath the second story window and there a grape vines extending from the backyard garden up alongside the house. The entire house is dark. He throws a small pebble which bounces off the glass of the second story window making a slight noise. He waits a while and since there is no response, he throws a second pebble, harder this time and making a louder noise. After a few moments, a light flickers on in the second story room and a girl appears to open the window and peers out.

TEENAGE AMBER

(Loud whispering) Dylan, what are you doing here?

TEENAGE DYLAN

(Also whispering loudly) Is that how you respond to someone when they wake you up at 3 in the morning to wish you happy birthday?

TEENAGE AMBER

(Slightly shocked)...Aww thank you...but you couldn't wait until morning?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Nope, it was too important.

TEENAGE AMBER

Wait, how'd you get here?

TEENAGE DYLAN

I walked.

TEENAGE AMBER

That's a 2 hour walk through a forest in the middle of the night...

TEENAGE DYLAN

Well, maybe I ran a little bit too. It's a beautiful night, a perfect night for a long walk. Amber, would you like to take a walk with me?

TEENAGE AMBER

Now? In the night?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Yes, well if you don't want your birthday present...

TEENAGE AMBER

(Smiles) Then just gimme a moment, I'll be right out soon.

Amber disappears into her room for a brief moment and then her light turns off. She re-emerges and we can see that she has changed clothes into something a little more suitable for the night walk. She slowly steps out of the window and gingerly climbs down the trellis. Amber briefly slips near the bottom of the trellis but Dylan is there to catch her as she falls into his arms.

TEENAGE AMBER

Thanks. (she climbs out of Dylan's arms and stands in front of him. Dylan extends his hand out towards her)

TEENAGE DYLAN

(Smiles) Let's go.

She takes his hand and they walk into the dark forest together.

END SCENE.

EXT. DOCK CLOSE TO MR. PETERSON'S BOATHOUSE

Dylan and Amber emerge from the forest onto a small clear area. The ground is cold and wet from the slight fog of the lake rolling towards them as they make their way to the dock that we can recognize from earlier. There are small row boats tied to the dock and we can see the same red row boat that Dylan used earlier. Dylan and Amber make their way to the end of the dock and sit down with their feet dangling off the edge. Dylan puts his bag down beside himself. He takes out portable light and pulls out the thermos.

TEENAGE AMBER

Where are we?

TEENAGE DYLAN

We're on the dock just outside Mr. Peterson's boathouse. I've fallen in love with this place and this place sort of my secret place and I wanted to share it with you on your birthday (He opens up the bag and takes out a couple of blankets and the thermos. He wraps one blanket around Amber and another around himself) I made us some hot cocoa for tonight, but I guess its not so hot anymore.

TEENAGE AMBER

That's alright (she grabs the cup of cocoa that Dylan pours for her) you know, this is so sweet of you. You're like the nicest boy in our class, probably our school.

TEENAGE DYLAN

Ah that's not true-

TEENAGE AMBER

It is, and you're always so artistic. (She looks at the sketchbook) Have you been painting any more pictures?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Sure I have, but they're not done and I don't want to show you yet-(Amber grabs the sketchbook from his hands and begins to flip through it) but I did learn how to do something new last week.

Dylan playfully takes back his sketchbook and turns to a new page and rips it out carefully. He begins to fold the paper as Amber watches him with awe. Dylan shows her the finished product: it's a small origami crane.

TEENAGE DYLAN (CONT'D)

It's an origami crane. (Hands it to Amber) I read that in Japanese culture, the crane symbolizes loyalty and joy. I'm always so happy whenever I'm with you. You're very special to me and I promise that I will never let you you.

TEENAGE AMBER

(Smiles) you're very special to me too. (She hugs Dylan tightly as she holds the crane. She looks back at the sketchbook) This is incredible.

TEENAGE DYLAN

You know, there's also another reason I brought you here.

TEENAGE AMBER

What's that?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Weil, I can't tell you. It's your birthday surprise.

The sky is on fire above, a deep crimson as the Sun begins to rise in the east: a burning prelude to the start of a new day. The dark red rays stretch across the heavens as it weaves around the dark scattered clouds and fades away into the distance. The lake gives off a dull reflection of the blazing sky, shimmering different shades of scarlet back towards the skies. Dylan gets up and takes Amber by the hand.

TEENAGE DYLAN (CONT'D)

Follow me.

Dylan steps down beside the row boat that is floating next to the dock and he helps Amber into the boat. His legs are a little bit under the water as he pushes off from the shore before climbing into the boat. The water gently glides underneath the boat and parts into waves that recede back towards the shoreline and becomes lost into a dense fog that rolls onto the lake. A gentle wind caresses her face and her hair falls over her eyes. She smiles the sweetest smile as she pushes the lock of hair back and looks at him. He sees her looking and smiles back, a calm peaceful smile, although his soul is burning as intensely as the world above them.

TEENAGE AMBER

This is so beautiful.

TEENAGE DYLAN

It is but it's not the surprise.

He gently swings the boat inland and stops rowing...

TEENAGE AMBER

What are you doing?

TEENAGE DYLAN

The current is strong enough here that I don't have to row anymore.

Dylan looks up into the crimson sky, pauses for a moment, and then looks back at Amber.

TEENAGE DYLAN (CONT'D)

I want you to do something for me.

TEENAGE AMBER

Anything.

TEENAGE DYLAN

I want you to close your eyes

TEENAGE AMBER

What?

TEENAGE DYLAN

Do you trust me?

TEENAGE AMBER

Yes...

TEENAGE DYLAN

Then I want you to close your eyes and not open them until I tell you to.

She looks at him, trying to see if he was joking or not, but he looks serious. She smiles and complies. The boat follows the current and begins to rock slightly as he moves closer to her. She can feel the wind against her cheek, it seems to have picked up, and there is a slight chill in the air which causes her to shudder. She feels his arms wrap around her giving her warmth which causes her to smile.

TEENAGE DYLAN (CONT'D)

Ok, you can open your eyes now.

She looks up and sees millions of cherry petals falling down from the heavens. The petals glide through the air, dancing around them, as the wind guides them. She looks around her and sees the pink petals landing softly and covering the entire lake. It is as if the boat is gliding slowly through a sea of pink roses. She looks back at him, his hair is full of these petals. She begins to pick them out of his hair. Dylan slowly moves his head closer to hers and touches her forehead. He brings his right hand up and gingerly caresses her face. She quickly draws in her breath. The air tastes cool and sweet. Time seems to slow down to a stop. The pink petals freeze in mid-air: silent and motionless.

END SCENE.

EXT. AMBER'S HOUSE – EARLY MORNING, JUST AFTER SUNRISE

Dylan and Amber emerge hand-in-hand from the trees which are adjacent to Amber's house and walk up the gravel road. We can see Amber's house clearly now, and its bright yellow walls are more distinct in the early morning light. There are two police patrol cars with lights still flashing parked hastily in the gravel driveway. Amber begins to look concerned.

TEENAGE DYLAN

What's going on?

TEENAGE AMBER

I dunno...

A figure emerges from the porch of Amber's house. It is her father. He looks very concerned and, as he sees the two, he beacons them to come inside the house quickly.

END SCENE.

INT. AMBER'S LIVING ROOM

All the sounds in this scene are inaudible and muffled; it is as if Dylan is in shock as he walks into the living, still holding onto Amber's hand. The living room is large with a lot of open space. There is a beige couch near the middle of the room, adjacent to a large window that is closed with translucent yellow drapes. The sunlight scatters in through the drapes given the room an ethereal atmosphere. Dylan's mother (Amanda) is seated in the couch and her hands are buried in her face. Amanda is visible distressed as Dylan walks into the room. Amber's mother (Mrs. Tiffani) is seated beside Amanda and has her hand on her shoulder, comforting Amanda. Two police officers are standing near the walkway.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER)

This is the moment that changed my life forever...everything seemed so clear in my mind and yet all the details are blurred...

Amanda looks up to see Dylan walk into the room and stand in the walkway. We can see tears streaming down her face. As we look closer, we can see several bleeding cuts on her face, and a bruised swollen eye. Amanda begins to speak to Dylan through visible sobs, however we cannot hear any audible words and instead all the sounds remain muffled.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...Dad came home last night, drunk as always and angry for losing the job at the mine...

FLASH CUT-SCENE (INT. DYLAN'S HOUSE)

Charlie lumbers and stumbles into the house sending the door crashing open, with an open beer bottle still in his hand. Amanda rises suddenly from her rocking chair and rushes to Charlie's aid and tries to help him to the couch. Instead he pushes her away.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...she tried to calm him down but he was not in his senses...

We see both Charlie and Amanda shouting at each other. Charlie is visible angry and seems to be very violent as her screams at Amber.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...and then he turned violent...

Charlie grabs a hold of Amanda as she tries to free herself. She is hitting him in the chest as Charlie continues to scream into her face. She pushes Charlie away who takes exception to this and takes a wild swing at Amanda and hits her with the beer bottle square in the left temple. The bottle shatters into a thousand pieces and Amanda falls down to the floor heavily, with the shards of broken brown glass falling all around her. Gingerly, Amanda gets up from the floor, bleeding from wounds on the left side of her face.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...luckily, she managed to call the police...

Charlie begins advancing towards Amanda. She pushes the rocking chair towards Charlie and he stumbles over it, falling over onto the ground. She takes this opportunity and rushes to the kitchen and dials 9-1-1 on the phone. We can see her screaming into the phone. Charlies stumbles over the chair a little more before regaining his balance and lumbers over to the kitchen. He shoves Amanda away from the phone. She falls backwards onto the kitchen floor and the phone goes flying from her hand. Charlie stands over her as Amanda as she cowers in the corner.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...they had a patrol car that was able to respond quickly to the domestic disturbance and likely saved her life...

We see two police officers burst through the door and rush into the house. They see Amanda's near unconscious body lying in the kitchen, bleeding profusely from her face and Charlie standing over her, still shouting and making violent gestures at her limp body. The first officer tackles Charlie and wrestles him to the ground and begins to cuff him as the second officer rushes to Amanda's side. The second officer reaches into his coat and pulls out a small walkie-talkie and calls for an ambulance out to dispatch.

FLASH CUT-SCENE (INT. AMBER'S LIVING ROOM)

Amanda gets up from the sofa, carefully supported by Mrs. Tiffani and one of the police officers walks up to her to take her arm. With the help, she walks up to Dylan and takes his face in her hands. Dylan begins to tear up as Amanda begins to tell something to him.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...she told me that she cannot live here anymore...that she cannot live in a place with so much pain, and that she and I were moving in with her sister in Vancouver...

Amber, also with tears in her eyes, turns to look at Dylan who doesn't look back. He is too shocked to notice anything around him anymore. Amanda is escorted past Dylan by the first officer and the second officer takes Dylan by the shoulder and begins to escort him out the door. We can see Dylan's and Amber's hands begin to unlock and separate. Amanda tries to hold on, but Dylan hand just slips away. Amber stands in the walkway as Dylan is escorted away. We see her lips move and call for Dylan. He turns around and tears are falling down from his face. He tells her something and then turns away and out the door. The tears continue to stream down Amber's face as her face contorts into an expression of deep pain and sorrow.

DYLAN (VOICE OVER - CONT'D)

...I know that moment broke her heart, just as my heart was broken...I wish I could have told her that I was in love with her...but all I could do was promise that I would come back for her...but I didn't...I broke my promise...

We see a small piece of paper fall from Amber's hand and fall gently to the ground. It is a paper origami crane.

FADE TO BLACK AND END SCENE.

ACT II

SETTING:

Ten years later in the cloudy and rainy modern day Vancouver, the heart of the urban tri-city metropolis in British Columbia. The city's spirit is on the rise as the anticipation of the 2010 Winter Olympics games are right around the corner and the city has been revamped and awaiting to host the world.

BLACK SCENE AND THEN FADE IN – 10 years later...

INT. LECTURE HALL OF UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

The lecture hall contains a fair number of students seated close to the lower stage, where the professor is talking. The podium in the stage and where the professor is talking has the name of the university written in bold blue letters. We can see the clock mounted on the wall above the main stage and it reads 9:46. Most students are typing away on their laptops as the professor talks. We can see a student slumped down half-asleep in his chair with an open laptop on his desk. He is wearing a grayish hoodie and blue jeans and has slightly messy dark brown hair. The professor notices this and calls on him.

PROFESSOR

Mr. Taylor?

The brunette boys eyes flutter awake but he still seems to be a little dazed. There is a very attractive blonde girl seated next to him.

BLONDE GIRL

(Whispers sharply) Dylan! Wake up!

She nudges him hard in the chest to which he sits upright, almost knocking over his laptop. We should have now realized that this university student in Dylan.

PROFESSOR

I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor, are the class and I interrupting your slumber this morning?

DYLAN

Uh no, sir, I was just...had my eyes just closed for a second...I was still paying attention...

PROFESSOR

Well, in that case, could you tell the class what the most important elements of a compelling fictional story are?

DYLAN

(pauses)...uh...

PROFESSOR

Mr. Taylor, if you are serious about pursuing a career in creative writing as the other more promising students in the class are, you must know these five basic elements.

Dylan remains quiet. The blonde girl seated beside him raises her hand.

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

Yes, Miss Kate.

ELIZABETH (ELLE) KATE

The five elements that make a fictional story are a protagonist or hero, a final outcome or goal for the hero to achieve. the antagonist who can serve as the obstacle to the goal, and the consequences if the hero succeeds, known as the stakes or if the hero fails, then the situation that may arise, known literally as jeopardy.

PROFESSOR

Excellent, Miss Kate. As I was saying class, over 80% of stories fail simple because these elements are either missing or not strong enough. We don't care about the hero, or his problem isn't serious enough, or he doesn't face strong enough obstacles to solving it, or there's nothing for him to win or lose. Case in point, the literary works by Stephanie Meyer, if we can even call them that (the class chuckles softly at this; he looks at his watch) Looks like we are out of time for today.

The class begins to close their laptops and put their books in their backpacks.

PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

Have a productive reading break. I do expect all of you to work on your term papers over the week of the break. Remember, the main theme is to discuss how 'your past has influenced you to become the person you are today'. See you after the break.

Dylan closes the lid of his laptop, but before he does we can see an open word document. Elle (attractive blonde girl) turns to Dylan.

ELLE

So what was that all about?

DYLAN

Well, while you were sleeping like an angel last night, I was up way too late trying to get a start on this term paper.

ELLE

How's that going?

DYLAN

I have about two sentences.

ELLE

Ouch. If it makes you feel any better, you're still two sentences ahead of me. (She picks up her bag with all her things)

DYLAN

I don't even know why you even took this class. You're not even majoring in creative writing. You're in psych. (He packs his laptop into his backpack and gets up)

ELLE

I thought it looked interesting, plus you're taking it, so I thought I'd at least try and keep you awake during lectures.

Both of them begin to walk up the stairs holding hands on their way out of the lecture hall.

DYLAN

Well, thank you, you're doing an awesome job at that. I'll see you back home after classes.

ELLE

Sure.

DYLAN

Try not to mess around with my guitar until I get home.

ELLE

No promises.

The two walk out the door of the lecture hall.

END SCENE.

INT. RESIDENCE HALLWAY

We can the tall building with the name UBC RESIDENCE written on the plaque at the front of the building casting a long shadow across the courtyard in the evening sun. Dylan opens the glass door to the building and presses the button for the elevator. He is on the ground floor of the University of British Columbia (UBC) residence buildings. Rows of wooden doors spans the hallways in both directions and it is the same on all the floors. You can just hear some heavy bass music playing in the background. The elevators dings open and he enters and presses the button for the 8th floor. The elevator lets him off at the designated floor and he walks to his room and the music seems to be getting louder. He pushes his key to the lock but the door swings open.

INT. RESIDENCE ROOM

There is a moderate spacious living room that only has a small couch and the kitchen is small but continuous with the living room. Beyond the living room there are glass sliding doors that lead to a small balcony.

ELLE

(Standing in the doorway) Hey sexy roomie! Saw you walking into the building.

Dylan is speechless. Elle is looking absolutely beautiful this evening. She is in a very sexy short black dress and is wearing long dangling earrings. Her blue eyes are sparking and exemplified by her baby blue eye shadow. She is wearing glossy pink lipstick which makes her pearly white smile irresistible.

DYLAN

(Stutters)Wow, you look amazing, babe.

ELLE

(Smiles even wider) Aww, thanks. (She wraps her arms around Dylan and gives him a sweet kiss)

DYLAN

(Looking around the room at the large number of people) I thought you said this would be a small little party.

ELLE

(Matter-of-factly) This is a small little party.

DYLAN

You and I have different meanings for the word small.

ELLE

Well, you're not a city boy. Trust me, this is tiny.

Dylan walks in and puts his coat onto the coat hanger. He is still amazed at the number of people Elle managed to fit into the dorm and still considers it quite a large number of people.

ELLE (CONT'D)

C'mon, let's get you a drink (she grabs a beer bottle from the fridge and holds it out to Dylan)

DYLAN

You know I don't drink, my dad was an abusive alcoholic.

ELLE

Well, I thought one couldn't hurt...after all, it is reading break, but who really does any reading...(Dylan still doesn't take it)ok, just more for me (she pops open the bottle and takes a long swig)

PARTY GOER #1

Whoo! Elle! Wicked party!

DYLAN

I'm gonna throw my stuff into my room.

ELLE

Alright, but don't stay in your room. You'll miss the party.

Dylan walks past Elle who rejoins the party. As he walks into his room, we can see Elle give him an unseen longing look. She sighs and smiles politely at another male partygoer who starts chatting her up.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S RESIDENCE ROOM

The room is very different from Dylan's childhood room. For one, there aren't any paintings up in the walls, no telescope beside the window, and no messy clothes that litter the floor and the bed. Instead, the clothes are all neatly folded into his drawers or hung in the closet. The telescope is replaced with an electric guitar that is resting next to the tidy bed. And the walls are bare, except for a single painting that reminds Dylan of his childhood. The same finger painting from his Kindergarten class with the green streaks and misshaped yellow Sun. We can tell that it is a bit worn out but still taped to the wall above his desk, which has books neatly stacked on one side. Dylan closes the door behind him to muffle the loud music, places his backpack onto the bed, takes out his laptop and rests it on the desk. The laptop pops into life showing the Windows 7 logon screen and Dylan logs in and opens up his term paper.

We can see some writing on the screen, maybe two lines. Dylan looks at his watch and it shows the time at 7:30. He begins to work on the essay, looking intently into his laptop screen.

END SCENE.

INT. RESIDENCE ROOM

The living room is filled with party goers and the music is really pumping loudly now. We can see a large somewhat muscular male flirting with Elle but she is not returning the favor.

MUSCULAR MALE

So I play as one of the power centers on the UBC Thunderbirds Ice Hockey team. Have you ever seen me play?

ELLE

Uh, I don't really go the UBC Hockey games.

MUSCULAR MALE

Oh no way, me neither. We already have so much in common and I've just met you Erin?

ELLE

(Rolls her eyes) Yeah...my name's Elle.

MUSCULAR MALE

Sure, Bill. You know, that's a really beautiful name.

Three girls all of a sudden rush towards Elle and grab her aside. The male looks annoyed but spots a cute brunette with low cut top in the corner of the room and heads towards her. The three girls all cover Elle in a protective shield and laugh madly.

ELLE

Oh my god, thank you guys so much. He is such a moron.

GIRL #1

I know him, he was in my econ class. He hits on anyone he think he can get into bed with him.

GIRL #2

But don't worry, we'll protect you from him. He tends to shit himself when he tries to approach a group of girls.

GIRL #1

So girl, tell us, how have you been?

ELLE

I've been alright, classes have been good. I'm so glad reading break is extra long this year.

GIRL #3

We all know we don't give a crap about your classes. Tell us, have you and Dylan had sex yet? Was it amazing? He looks like he could be very good in bed.

ELLE

(Surprised) What?

GIRL #1

Oh like you guys have only been together for like almost two years and you guys sleep together in the same bed (pauses and studies Elle's face). Seriously, no sex?

ELLE

(Sighs) No-

GIRL #2

Wow, well, we'll have to change that. Where's Dylan?

GIRL #1

I saw him go into his room.

GIRL #2

Let's go.

ELLE

No, wait—

The girls pulls ELLE into Dylan's room. Dylan is looks up surprised from the laptop but still smiles.

GIRL #2

Dylan, what are you doing in here? Studying? You're missing the party.

DYLAN

I just wanted to finish something quickly.

GIRL #3 sees the finger painting taped to the wall in front of his desk. She looks intently at the painting.

GIRL #3

Elle told us that you were an artist, but she never told us how amazing you are (laughs)

DYLAN

(laughing) That is my first painting, it was in kindergarten. And I never stopped since. What time is it? (Looks at his watch)

GIRL #2

Its just quarter past nine. The party started at seven, and we thought since you're missing the party, we'd bring the party into here.

Dylan gives Elle a quizzical glance and Elle shrugs back. Girl #1 pulls Dylan off his chair and starts dancing with him to the music, which now fills the room due to the open door. Dylan looks slightly uncomfortable but plays along. Girl #3 pushes Elle towards Dylan and the two begin to dance together while the other girls keep dancing with each other. Girl #1 pulls out a camera and focuses it on Dylan and Elle dancing.

GIRL #1

Smile guys, this one's going on Facebook.

GIRL #3

Make sure you get Mr. Artist's painting.

Dylan and Elle both quickly pose and smile at the camera as it flashes and takes the picture.

DYLAN

(Whispers to Elle) Friends of yours?

ELLE

(Whispers back lying) Never seen them before in my life.

DYLAN

(Laughs and turns back to Elle) Liar...

ELLE

(Smiles) Yeah, you got me. How 'bout we ditch 'em and go to the balcony. Away from all the people and noise.

DYLAN

Sounds perfect (Dylan takes hold of her hand and leads her out of the room)

Just before they disappear, Elle looks back and shoots a beaming smile to the girls who all wave back and giggle.

END SCENE.

EXT. RESIDENCE BALCONY

The balcony is small but the view is incredible. It provides an amazing view of downtown Vancouver, which twinkles back with thousands of little lights. The sky is dark but clear and there is a slight chilly wind. Dylan and Elle stand close together on the balcony, slightly leaning onto the railing. Dylan has his arms around Elle's waist.

ELLE

I'm sorry about them. They're always so crazy. They're in my psych class but sometimes I think they would make better patients than actual students.

DYLAN

Well, don't you think that we can all be just a bit crazy?

ELLE

What do you mean?

DYLAN

Well, I'm a little bit crazy...(smiles at Elle) crazy in love with you.

ELLE

(laughs) You're just a little bit lame too.

DYLAN

(laughs) So I've been told.

Dylan looks out into the view of downtown but Elle looks intently at him for a moment.

ELLE

What's wrong?

DYLAN

Oh nothing.

ELLE

Dylan, we're been together for almost two years. I think I know when something is not sitting right with you.

DYLAN

I'm just really stressed about this term paper. I have to do well in this course, or else I won't get into my creative writing program and I won't be able to graduate with my creative writing degree.

ELLE

Maybe I can help. I am a psych student, after all.

DYLAN

It's just whenever I think about the past and my childhood, all I have are painful memories. My father being a drunk, him abusing my mother and finally, last year...(trails off and we can see Dylan is visibly uncomfortable)

ELLE

...I know the passing of your mother was hard on you...but I know you must have some good memories from childhood. What about your first painting? I'm sure that's a good memory. I've seen it on your wall since we've been together but you've never told me the story.

DYLAN

(Smiles) That is a good memory. (Looks at Elle) It was my first day of kindergarten, and I was so shy but this girl, Amber, she showed me how to finger paint. Instantly, we became best friends. (Smiles) How do you always know the right things to say?

ELLE

(Smiles back at Dylan)'Cause I'm a girl, and we're always right. (Pauses and thinks for a moment) I think I have an idea. You should go back.

DYLAN

Back where?

ELLE

To your hometown, for reading break, so you revisit all the good memories from your childhood and finish your term paper. Also, it may help you heal yourself by remembering that your childhood wasn't all bad.

DYLAN

(Thinks about it) That's a really great idea. Do you want to come back to Kimberly with me?

ELLE

I would love to but I think this is something you need to do yourself.

DYLAN

(Pauses and thinks carefully) You're right. You always know what to say to cheer me up, Elizabeth (smiles and gives her a big hug)

ELLE

(Smiles back) Don't call me Elizabeth.

END SCENE.

EXT. RESIDENCE PARKING LOT – MID-DAY

Although it is only the middle of the day, the sky is dark and cloudy and the rain is coming down heavily. We can see Elle is standing outside the UBC residence buildings just underneath the cover of the building so as to not get wet. She is wearing a black overcoat but still clutching herself to keep warm as her blonde hair blows wildly in the wind. Beside her on the ground are Dylan's backpack, a dark green duffel bag and a small suitcase. A dark blue hatchback sedan pulls into the parking lot in front of the building, wipers swinging frantically, casting the rain off the windshield. The car stops and Dylan pops out of the driver's seat, leaving the car door open. He is only wearing a short sleeve white t-shirt and jeans and get thoroughly soaked running to Elle from the car.

DYLAN

(Soaked from head to toe) Thanks for bringing down my bags.

ELLE

Hey, it's no problem. I hope you have fun on your trip and it helps you with your term paper.

DYLAN

Are you sure you don't want to come along?

ELLE

I'm sure, plus I have my own term paper to worry about remember? Now get going, I don't want you driving in this weather at night.

DYLAN

Alright (gives her a quick kiss) I'll miss you.

Dylan walks away from Elle and pops the stuff into the car. As he steps in he waves goodbye to Elle who blows him a kiss and waves bye. Dylan starts the car and backs out of the parking lot.

END SCENE.

ACT III

Montage of Dylan driving along the roads and highways on his way back to his old hometown of Kimberly, BC. We can hear music playing in the background [The Fray – Vienna]. The car drives through the dark cloudy weather, splashing through the heavy rainfall. We can Dylan in the car; he has a very depressed look on his face. He looks at the iPhone on the passenger's seat and we can see it flashing. Dylan picks it up and looks at it. We can see a text message from Elle that reads 'I'll miss you too :(' and an attachment. Dylan clicks the attachment and a picture pops up. It is the picture that was taken at the party. The picture shows Dylan and Elle holding each other. Elle has an amazing beaming smile and Dylan is sticking his tongue out at the camera. There is a picture of the finger painting taped to the wall behind them. Dylan smiles and puts the iPhone back on the passenger seat. The car zooms past a sign on the highway that reads 'Now Entering Kimberly, BC'. Dylan's blue hatchback sedan takes the exit and leaves the highway and we can see it progress along several roads until he sees a large neon sign in the distance. It reads 'Kimberly Motel' and just underneath it says 'Vacancy' both in large neon orange letters. Dylan's blue hatchback slows down and pulls into the parking lot of the motel.

END SCENE.

INT. HOTEL ROOM – NEXT MORNING

Dylan opens his eyes to the sound of a buzzing alarm clock. He twists out his arm from bed and hits the snooze button. The clock reads 9 am. He sits up in bed. We can the beautiful morning sunlight streaming in from the hotel room window. Dylan gets up and opens up the window, a gentle breeze rolls in causing the drapes to flow angelically. The fresh spring air and sounds of birds fills the room. We can see Dylan smile as he looks out into the view of his old hometown of Kimberly, BC. Much of it has changed, it is no longer just farms and open spaces but now there are roads and businesses. Dylan goes to his dresser and picks up his iPhone and turns it on. The picture from last night is still on the screen. He smiles looking at Elle.

DYLAN

(To Himself) So where should I start, Elle?

He notices the finger painting behind them in the picture.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

(Still to himself) Of course, my old kindergarten class.

He puts his iPhone down onto the dresser and heads into the bathroom.

END SCENE.

INT. MOTEL LOBBY

Dylan walks down the stairs into the lobby, which is devoid of people except for the attendants seated behind the desk. Dylan walks up to one of the clerks behind the desk and deposits his keys on the desk. His eyes met with the clerk, dressed fashionably in suit and tie, and a flash of recognition crosses the clerk's face. As Dylan turns to leave, the clerk calls out to him.

CLERK

Dylan...?

Dylan stops in his tracks and turns around but still unable to recognize the clerk.

CLERK

Oh my God, it is you. I haven't seen you in years.

DYLAN

I'm sorry, I can't recall who you are.

CLERK

Oh, you probably wouldn't, I was only 9 when you left town. I'm Theodore Peterson.

DYLAN

...Teddy...?

TEDDY

You do remember (smiles)

DYLAN

Oh my God, it is go great to see you (extends his hand and shakes Teddy's hand). Where's your father?

TEDDY

(looks down) He died a few years back. Lung cancer.

DYLAN

Oh I'm very sorry. My condolences. He was a great man.

TEDDY

Thanks, Dylan. So what brings you back to Kimberly?

DYLAN

Inspiration for writing?

TEDDY

Well, I remember you used to go for a boat ride down by the lake for things like that. My dad's boathouse is still around but no one rents the boats out anymore but I can let you borrow one if you want.

DYLAN

I will definitely take you up on that offer. But not right now, I thought I'd start at my old school. That's still around?

TEDDY

It is, but the building has been expanded and now it's only an elementary school. But it's still quite early in the morning. May I suggest a great eatery just down the street? They make excellent homemade pancakes and who can say no that covered in real Canadian maple syrup?

DYLAN

(Laughs) Sure, that sounds great. Thanks a lot, Teddy.

TEDDY

(Takes Dylan's keys and puts it up on a hook on the wall behind the desk) Sure, Dylan. See you around.

DYLAN

Bye.

Dylan walks out the door of the motel as Teddy continues about his business.

END SCENE.

INT. KIMBERLY EATERY

The atmosphere is of a classic '90s diner with booth tables against the large windows where we can see a moderately busy street. We can see a church a bit in the distance through one of these large winows. Dylan is seated at one of these booths and a waitress is serving him some hot coffee and pancakes. In the front of the store, a 40 year old man, clean shaven but with a good proportion of grays in his hair, walks into the eatery. He sits at the counter where the waitress pours him a cup of coffee.

WAITRESS

(To Dylan) So how are you enjoying the food?

DYLAN

Great, I haven't had homemade pancakes since I was a kid. Brings back a lot of memories.

WAITRESS

We don't get a lot of tourists this time of year. Well, I hope you enjoy your stay.

The man at the counter turns his head slightly and takes a look at Dylan.

DYLAN

Well, thank you very much. I actually grew up here but now I go to school in Vancouver.

WAITRESS

Well, I hope your stay is enjoyable.

DYLAN

Sure. Thanks.

The waitress walks away and the old man is still staring at Dylan. He casually gets up and takes his cup of coffee and sits down across from Dylan in the booth. Dylan looks up, slightly annoyed and confused.

DYLAN

...Can I help you?

OLD MAN

What's your name?

DYLAN

Um...is there something I can help you with, sir?

The old man looks intently at Dylan, almost as in disbelief.

OLD MAN

Dylan...? It's me...don't you recognize me?

DYLAN

No...(looks carefully at the old man and then suddenly a flash of recognition crosses Dylan's face)...Dad?

OLD MAN (aka DYLAN'S FATHER – CHARLIE)

(Smiles) Dylan...I haven't seen you in so long.

DYLAN

(His face twists into an expression of annoyance and anger) There's good reason for that. (Signals to the waitress) Check please and can I get this packed. (Turns back to Charlie) You have a lot of nerve coming up to me like this.

CHARLIE

Dylan, I'm sorry. I've changed. I've found God and I'm in AA, I've been sober for years now.

DYLAN

You'll forgive me if I have trouble believing that. (Gets up from the booth and grabs packaged food from waitress and hands her a $10 bill)

CHARLIE

...Please, don't leave. Let's talk.

DYLAN

(To waitress) Keep the change. (To Charlie) No, I'd rather not. (Starts to walk towards the door)

CHARLIE

...How's Mandy?

DYLAN

(Without looking back as he walks out the door) Mom's dead.

Dylan walks out the door and we can see Charlie's face is of deep sorrow. He looks down into his cup and puts his hand on his forehead in grief.

END SCENE.

EXT. KIMBERLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

The school is no longer the small red brick building which we saw earlier. Instead, Kimberly Elementary has been expanded to include many other buildings adjacent to each other. The old Kimberly building has been repainted into a eye pleasing beige and some sections of it have been rebuilt over the years. The playground has also been reconstructed and the softball field now has an adjacent soccer field as well as a basketball court not too far away. We see Dylan walk up to the school and take a moment. He absorbs everything, the sights, sounds, and smell of his surroundings before heading into Kimberly Elementary through its big taupe wooden doors.

END SCENE.

INT. KIMBERLY KINDERGARTEN CLASS

Dylan walks through the empty hallways and passes by many classrooms. He peers in momentarily, seeing students seated straight in rows of desks. He comes up to his old classroom and stands in the doorway. He smiles at what he sees. Unlike the exterior of the school, the inside of the kindergarten classroom has not changes much in the last years. The desks and carpets have been replaced, but the yellow paint remains the same and the sunlight streams in from the large pane windows, as it has for the last couple of decades. The paintings taped to walls over the years have been replaced with more and more paintings over the years. And, just as Dylan's first day of kindergarten, the little kids are all sitting down and painting more pictures for the walls around the classroom. The kindergarten teacher is a young beautiful blonde 25 year old woman. She is wearing a sunshine yellow dress which makes her glow in the light. She has striking green eyes and a cute and glowing smile as she talks to one of the little kindergarteners who holds up a recently drawn painting up to her. The kindergartener looks at the door and sees Dylan, he tugs at the teachers skirt and points at the doorway. The teacher turns around looks at Dylan.

She freezes when she sees Dylan. Her green eyes open up in surprise and her smile slowly disappears from her face. Dylan also suddenly freezes and is absolute mesmerized by the beauty of the woman right in front of him. He suddenly recognizes her, as she recognizes him. She turns around and escorts the young kid to his seat and then she starts walking towards Dylan. Dylan backs out into the hallway and the teacher follows him into the hallway, slowly shutting the door behind her but not taking her eyes off of him. Her green eyes are locked onto Dylan's brown eyes, and Dylan looks back deeply into her eyes. Finally, he speaks.

DYLAN

Amber-

AMBER

Dylan?

DYLAN

Oh my God...it's you.

Amber swallows and tries not to allow her sadness to show. Her eyes remain fixed with Dylan's but we can see her eyes begin to tear up. She clears her throat and finally breaks eye contact by looking down.

AMBER

What are you doing here?

DYLAN

I could ask you the same thing...you're teaching kindergarten?

AMBER

The school needed someone. They didn't have many options since most people started moving away the last few years.

DYLAN

But you stayed.

AMBER

I love this town, it means everything to me.

DYLAN

I love this town, too. I have so many happy memories here.

AMBER

(looks back up to Dylan and we can see tears in her eyes) My happiness ended the day you left, Dylan.

DYLAN

I'm sorry-

AMBER

Do you remember the last thing you said to me?

FLASHBACK (BLACK AND WHITE)

Young Dylan is being escorted out of Amber's house the day that they left Kimberly. We can see their hands separate and Dylan turning around to look at her as he is being escorted out. His lips moves and utter inaudible words. Amber closes her eyes and tears stream down her face.

AMBER (CONT'D)

Do you remember what you promised me that day?

DYLAN

(His face shows an expression of sudden realization) I'll come back for you.

FLASHBACK (BLACK AND WHITE)

The paper crane falls out of Amber's hand and floats down gently through the air and lands on the ground.

AMBER

(The tears stream down her face now and she speaks trying to swallow the lump in her throat) That's right. But you didn't. I waited for you. I looked out the window everyday for you. I stayed by the phone for days. You never came back. You didn't phone, you didn't write.

DYLAN

Amber...I'm so sorry...

AMBER

It's too late to just apologize, don't you think? Ten years, Dylan. You think after ten years you can just suddenly show up and say sorry?!

DYLAN

(He looks very choked now as well)...Amber...please...let me explain...

AMBER

No, I don't care...I was in love with you, Dylan. And you broke my heart.

Dylan stares speechless at Amber, without any idea of what to say. He reaches his hand up to try to touch her cheek, maybe comfort her. She brushes it aside.

AMBER (CONT'D)

I think you should leave, Dylan.

Dylan stands frozen in front of Amber, their eyes locked once again. Tears streaming down her face and he is in shock, as if someone has just slapped his hard across the face.

AMBER (CONT'D)

(Forcefully) Leave!

Dylan backs away, unable to break eye contact for a brief second, but then looks down and starts to walk away down the hallway. Amber watches him go and then she quickly wipes the tears from her eyes before walking back into the classroom.

END SCENE.

INT. MONICA'S CAFÉ

Monica's café is small coffee place close by the Kimberly motel and has a very rustic atmosphere. Several people are seated at the tables drinking and talking. Dylan is the only person that sits alone at the table in the corner. He takes a sip of his coffee and checks his iPhone. The phone shows that he has no calls. Dylan watches the people walk across the street, going about their daily lives as he sits, as if frozen in time, in the corner table. He checks the time and it is well past 4 and the Sun seems to be low in the sky. The waitress comes by and asks if he needs anything else. Dylan shakes his head and pulls out his wallet and leaves some money on the table as he leaves.

END SCENE.

INT. MOTEL ROOM

Dylan lies on his back in bed still awake. We can see the covers splayed over him as he stares at the glare of the neon sign blinking on the ceiling. He looks at the clock beside the bed and it reads 2:00 am.

DYLAN

(To himself) God...

He turns onto his side and closes his eyes. After a few moments he opens them again and turns back onto his original position on the bed and looks at the clock. It still reads 2:00 am. He closes his eyes for a moment and he remembers flashes of his childhood.

FLASH

Young Dylan laughing as Amber paints all over his painting. He draws a yellow sun on her painting and she tries to draw a sun on his but the shape is not right.

FLASH

Dylan playing softball with Amber. They're throwing the ball to each other, running around the field, Dylan trying to hit the ball as Amber pitches it to him. He swings and misses the ball and slips on the early morning grass and Amber breaks out laughing, and he starts laughing too.

DYLAN

(Turns back onto his side, eyes still closed)

FLASH

Amber cheering him on at bat during his big softball game. He sees himself hitting the ball and rounding onto third base, seeing Amber looking anxiously as he runs for home and her cheering madly as he arrives safely onto home plate. He sees her smile light up the entire field and she is so happy as she can see the teammates all huddle around Dylan.

FLASH

Dylan and Amber holding hands walking through the forest, both smiling.

FLASH

Dylan throwing pebbles onto Amber's bedroom window. She comes out of the window and crawls down and falls into Dylan's arms.

FLASH

Dylan showing her his sketchbook on the dock by the lake. The cherry petals frozen in mid-air as Dylan wraps his arms around Amber in the boat gently floating in the water.

The scene slowly fades to black.

END SCENE.

EXT. KIMBERLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PARKING LOT

The day is slightly chilly and we can see a little bit of frost on the windshields of cars parked in the parking lot. There aren't many cars and they are sparsely parked. A woman exits the elementary school building and walks down to the parking lot. As the camera zooms in closer, we can see that it is Amber. She digs around in her purse, looking for her keys and walks up to her car. As she pulls her hand out with the keys, she looks up at the car and stops. There, on the windshield, held in place by the wiper blades, is a single blossoming red rose. Its rises up and glowing brightly above the icy windshield, as if defiant against the cold weather. She reaches out and pulls the rose out from the wipers and smells it. She hears a voice from behind.

VOICE

Do you have any idea how hard it is to find roses in this town?

She turns around and she sees Dylan standing behind her. He has a hopeful face and she is a little annoyed but doesn't back away..

AMBER

I hate flowers.

Dylan freezes and is speechless. He didn't expect to hear that.

AMBER (CONT'D)

So what? You're stalking me now?

DYLAN

Well, no.

AMBER

Then how'd you know this was my car?

DYLAN

I asked...

AMBER

Hmm...so what do you want?

DYLAN

I know it may not mean much but I still want to say I'm sorry for everything. I'm an idiot, and I feel like a big one now.

AMBER

If that's your apology, then you're right, it doesn't mean much.

DYLAN

(Falters for a moment)umm...but I wanted to make it up to you...somehow...I should've done this a long time ago, but let me take you out to dinner...

AMBER

You think you can just ask me out on a date after this?

DYLAN

I know, I was just hoping I could at least do something to make it up to you.

AMBER

So you think taking me out to dinner makes up for 10 years of absence?

DYLAN

I just want a chance to make this right.

AMBER

Dylan, maybe this wasn't clear. You were always oblivious to a lot of things. There isn't any way to make this right.

Amber throws the rose down at Dylan's feet and opens up the door to her car. She gets into the car, starts and drives away, without looking back at Dylan, who stays standing in the parking lot, frozen in pain with the red rose on the ground in front of him.

END SCENE.

EXT. ROAD

Dylan walks alone along the sidewalk of the road just past Kimberly Elementary. He walks past the café that we remember from before and continues to walk past. He sees a man wearing a dark brown coat and hat enter the church across the street. For a moment, Dylan pauses and we see that he recognizes this man. Dylan looks both ways before crossing the street and enters the church.

END SCENE.

INT. CHURCH

The church is relatively large for the town with large multicolored windows casting auras of many colors onto the floor. The church pews are empty as it is late afternoon and no service is being held. However, the man is the brown coat can be seen way in the front, as he is seated on one of the closest pews. His hat is beside him and he has his head down in deep prayer. Dylan gingerly walks up to the man and sits down beside him. The man, as if awoken by the sudden noise, looks up at Dylan and smiles. We can see that it is Dylan's father, Charlie.

DYLAN

What are you doing here?

CHARLIE

Making prayers. For myself, for you...for your mother. Praying for forgiveness and mercy.

DYLAN

Do you come here often?

CHARLIE

Yes, ever since I've found the will and patience to change my life...son, I cannot tell you how sorry I am for everything...I can only wish that you could give me a second chance.

DYLAN

(Sighs) I wish I could, but its just so difficult knowing what kind of person you are.

CHARLIE

Was, son, I swear, I am no longer that person. Son, can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?

DYLAN

It's hard to forgive someone...especially if they completely lost your trust...broke your heart...(trails off and looks down)

CHARLIE

(Looks carefully at Dylan) I may not have the best relationship with you, Dylan, but I know when something is wrong.

DYLAN

It's nothing.

CHARLIE

Please, tell me son. Trust me and I have put my trust in God.

DYLAN

(After a long pause) The day we left Kimberly, I promised something to someone very special to me. I promised her that I would come back for her.

Dylan runs his hand through his hair and is in obvious grief.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

But I didn't. I didn't see or talk to her for 10 years. I forgot her, but she never forgot me, she stayed hoping for me but I let her down and I hurt her. A few days ago, I ran into her. She's doing well but she wants nothing to do with me. And I just can't explain it, but just realizing that I hurt her...its really hurt me...I never realized how much I cared about her...

CHARLIE

I'm sorry, son. I've known you long enough to know that we're talking about Amber.

DYLAN

(Choked) I messed up, Dad, I really did. And I wish I could just make it better for her, and stop the pain that I feel inside myself (buries his face into his hands)

CHARLIE

(Puts his arm around Dylan) Son, forgiveness doesn't happen overnight. It takes time and its takes tremendous amounts of patience. Amber has had her share of pain. A few years ago, her parents passed away tragically in a car accident.

Dylan looks up at his father shocked.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

It happened suddenly and her whole world was changed. She had to move out of her house. Now she lives in an apartment somewhere on the west end of town. And she had to look hard for a job. The principal of the elementary school was generous enough to give her the job, and she makes enough to support herself.

Dylan still looks like he is in shock. The entire situation has just been blown out of proportion.

CHARLIE

I know her parents loved you very much. I think you should pay them a visit while you're still in town, I know they would appreciate it.

DYLAN

Where are they buried?

CHARLIE

In Gemsfield, just close to the west side. I know Amber visits her parents every Friday. Maybe you should go and try to find her. She needs you to help her through this. She may not show it, but what she feels for you can help her heal.

DYLAN

Thanks, Dad. I really appreciate this. I cannot tell you how much I'm in pain just thinking about how much this must hurt for her and how much more I've added to her sorrow...when is she going to be there?

CHARLIE

I've heard from Father Robert that she usually goes to see her parents when there is no one around. So she can talk to them and be with them.

DYLAN

When is that?

CHARLIE

Usually just after midnight.

END SCENE.

EXT. GEMSFIELD CEMETARY

The night air is cold and we can see Dylan's breath as he walks into the cemetery, with the great iron letters above him read 'GEMSFIELD CEMETARY'. The dense fog rolls along stone tombstones as Dylan walks deeper and deeper into the cemetery. The night is not dark; instead, the full moon lights up the graveyard, casting shadows that seem like moving figures running along the dense white fog. Dylan walks down the path and heads towards a small secluded area, just under two adjacent weeping willows. Their branches sway slightly in the wind, as if sweeping away the dense fog from the graves underneath them. Sitting on her knees under the weeping willows, we can see Amber in the center of the mist as it billows away from her, as if revealing her to Dylan as he walks up behind her. She doesn't hear him coming so he stands quietly behind her. We can see several white roses in Dylan's right hand as he stands behind Amber.

AMBER (To graves)

...and the children drew the most amazing paintings today, Mom...(pauses for a long time) I wish you could see them...I miss you guys so much...(crying)

The wind begins to pick up as we see the branches of the weeping willow sway. Dylan stands motionless behind Amber but she turns around slowly. She is slightly shocked when she sees him. Their eyes lock. Amber's eyes are filled with tears which stream down her face. Dylan looks back at her with a saddened face. She wipes the tears away with the sleeve of her jacket.

AMBER (To Dylan)

What are you doing here?

DYLAN

To pay my respects...(he solemnly kneels down onto the grass in front of the tombstones that reads 'Jonathan Tiffani' and 'Lucy Marie Tiffani') I just heard and I want you to know that I'm sorry. I know how much they mean to you.

AMBER

(Pauses for a moment but decides to reply)...thanks...

DYLAN

Why do you come here so late?

AMBER

It's quiet, empty, it lets me be alone with them.

DYLAN

Do you mind if I say a few words to them?

AMBER

(Thinks about it for a moment but then decides)...sure...

Dylan places down the white roses on the dirt in front of the tombstones and he puts his head down in prayer. This time, Dylan is on his knees kneeling down in front of the graves as Amber stands behind him, with the swaying branches of the weeping willows. The moonlight streams in, caressed by the swaying branches and illuminates the tombstones.

DYLAN

(Raises his head and begins to speak somberly) Mr. and Mrs. Tiffani...hi, umm, it's me, Dylan. I know that I haven't been around much and I know it's not enough to just show up now and pretend like everything's ok...

Amber walks up beside to Dylan and looks curiously on.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

...but I wanted to let you know that I'm here and I'm sorry that Amber lost such amazing and loving parents so soon. I've never had a close relationship with my father or mother, but I know how painful it can be to lose someone...(sighs)...

Amber kneels down beside Dylan and continues to look intently at him. We can see her eyes still have some tears in them.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

(Begins to cry and stops himself and laughs awkwardly) This place has always meant so much to me and I'm sorry I lost sight of that. Your daughter, she means more than the world to me, and I'm sorry I lost sight of that too...I guess you never realize how beautiful and lovely something this until you lose it...

Dylan turns to face Amber. He looks deeply into her eyes and we can see that his eyes are also filled with tears and his face has a deep expression of sadness.

DYLAN

...I didn't realize how beautiful and lovely you are until I lost you...I didn't realize how much you mean to me until you were gone...

Dylan pauses and continues looking into Amber's eyes and they seem frozen in time as the willow branches sway behind them and the dense fog rolls over their knees. After the moment of silence, Dylan breaks the eye contact by looking down and gets up slowly. Without looking back, he slowly walks away from the grave. Amber watches his get up and leave, and then she puts her head down in sadness.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S MOTEL ROOM

The room is completely dark but we can still see Dylan lying on his side with his eyes completely open but his face is streaming with tears. He wipes them away with the bedsheets and gives a heavy sigh as he rolls over to his other side. His body now faces the window, which has the curtains pulled back. Although there was moonlight earlier, the dark clouds have now rolled in and over the night in a deep blackness. We can hear the sounds of thunder softly in the distance. All of a sudden, we hear a clink! Sound on the window. At first, Dylan just seems to focus in on the room. He looks around from his lying down position but decides that it was nothing and continues his state. And then we hear another but louder and more distinct clink! This time Dylan sits up in bed and looks around the room. The third clink! comes quickly following the previous we can hear it distinctly coming from the window. Dylan notices this and gets up and walks towards the window. He opens it and peers outside.

We can see Amber standing in the parking lot of the motel. She has a few small rocks in her hand. She signals Dylan to come out and join her. He obliges, walks into the closet and puts on a jacket as he walks out the door.

END SCENE.

EXT. KIMBERLY MOTEL PARKING LOT

Dylan walks out of the front entrance of the motel and right out into the parking lot and their eyes met once again. We can see Amber standing there, waiting for him, her expression is welcoming and softer than it was before. Dylan walks up and stops in front of Amber. Music starts playing in the background [Taylor Swift – Fearless]

AMBER

Hi.

DYLAN

Hi...how'd you find me?

AMBER

I called every motel in town...

Dylan chuckles lightly.

AMBER (CONT'D)

I want to thank you for coming to see my parents. They really thought it was very sweet of you.

Dylan doesn't say anything but his smile says all that needs to be said.

AMBER (CONT'D)

And I want you to know that you never lost me.

Thunder sounds and suddenly the rain begins to pour down heavily onto the parking lot. Dylan and Amber laugh loudly at the sudden downpour. Dylan looks up into the night sky, with his eyes closed, letting the rain wash all over his face. He laughs and says:

DYLAN

Rain...how cliché is that?

After a brief moment, Dylan looks down at Amber, who looks back with a smile that we haven't seen in a long time. Dylan holds his hand out to Amber.

DYLAN (CONT'D)

May I have this dance?

Amber takes his hand as Dylan wraps his arms around her and brings her close to himself as they begin to slow dance. Amber's blonde hair is now wet and matted down onto her face. Dylan reaches up and brushes the wet hair away from her face softly with his hand. He rests his palms on her cheeks and places his forehead onto hers.

DYLAN

(Closes his eyes) Amber...I love you...

AMBER

(Closes her eyes and breathes out the words) Dylan...I've always loved you...

Dylan moves in closer and their lips touch for their first kiss. Dylan kisses her softly as he holds her in his hands. She kisses him back as she puts her arms around Dylan's waist and pulls him in closer.

CAMERA ZOOMS OUT

We see the two locked in embrace as the rain pours down hard on the parking lot. The music begins to slowly fade out.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S MOTEL ROOM

We hear a distinctive sound of a cell phone ringing and it fills the room. The camera slowly focuses on a iPhone ringing on the bedside desk. We can see the covers of the bed thrown slightly away to reveal Amber. She slowly opens her eyes and looks around the room. She sits up in bed and looks around and no one else is in the room.

AMBER

Dylan?

She hears no response but we can hear the water running in the bathroom. She sees the door closed. The phone continues to ring so she decides to pick it up.

AMBER

Hello?

A girl's voice can be heard on the phone. It is Elle.

ELLE (On phone)

Hello, Dylan?

AMBER

He's busy right now, can I take a message?

ELLE

Who's this?

AMBER

Amber...who's this?

ELLE

(Sternly) It's his girlfriend.

Amber's face suddenly freezes and it seems like all the blood drains from her face.

ELLE (CONT'D)

What are you doing with Dylan's phone?

AMBER

Uh...I'm just his...friend...from school...I'm just holding his phone until he comes back.

ELLE

Oh, alright. Well, is he going to be awhile?

AMBER

Ummm...maybe, I don't know...

ELLE

Well, alright. Can you let him know I called?

AMBER

Sure.

ELLE

Thanks.

AMBER

Bye.

Amber slowly hangs up the phone. We can see her face is in shock as she gets up and begins to put on her street clothes. She grabs her jacket and heads for the door. Just at this moment, Dylan walks out of the bathroom. He is bare-chested and wearing a towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is moist for the shower he evidently took. He sees Amber leaving.

DYLAN

Hey, where're you going? I thought I could treat you to breakfast.

Amber freezes on her way out the door but she doesn't look up at him when she speaks. Her voice quivers and we cannot see her face.

AMBER

No...that's ok...I have to do some things...for work...

DYLAN

(Confused)...but it's the weekend...I'm sure it can wait 'til later.

AMBER

No, I think it's better if I leave.

Dylan walks towards Amber and she backs off. Finally she raises her head and we can see tears streaming down her face.

DYLAN

What's wrong?

AMBER

How could you lie to me? How could you do this to me?

DYLAN

(Even more confused) I don't understand.

AMBER

She called, Dylan. Your girlfriend.

Now Dylan freezes and we can see the sudden realization cross his face. He forgot about Elle, this town has forced him to think about his past that he completely forgot about everything else that was going on in his life.

DYLAN

I...

AMBER

It's ok, you don't have to say anything.

DYLAN

It's not what you think...

AMBER

Yeah, somehow nothing you say can make this better. None of what you said meant anything did it? Boy this sounds familiar?

DYLAN

That's not true. I meant everything-

AMBER

Save it. I don't want to hear it.

She turns her back on Dylan, then stops and turns around to say her final words.

AMBER (CONT'D)

You should...just go and never come back. I don't ever want to see you again.

She storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her, as Dylan stands in the room, completely shocked and frozen.

END SCENE.

EXT. FOREST

We can see Dylan walking through the forest all by himself. Some of us might recognize the forest as the same path earlier in the movie but it can be any forest. The sunlight shines through the sparse budding leaves but heavy rain falls down from the skies splashing loudly on the small leaves of the tall trees as they come crashing down to the ground. There is a slight fog on the ground as Dylan continues to walk down the path. A small sparrow lands on a tree branch not far from Dylan, which catches his eye. He stops and stares at if for a while. The sparrow almost looks like it is looking back at Dylan. It sings a note and flutters away. Dylan watches it fly up in to the air and off into the distance. He continues staring in that direction and a familiar sight causes him to walk towards that direction.

END SCENE.

EXT. DYLAN'S HOUSE

Dylan walks up to his old house. The forest has grown closer to his house over the last few years. But unlike the forest, the house hasn't changed much over the years. The yellow paint is still as vibrant as before and the white picket fence is still there. The lawn has been tended to over the years and the oak tree in the front lawn now stands a lot taller but still stands adjacent to Dylan's old room. Dylan is amazed as he walks up to the front door. He stands there for a moment, not knowing what to do but then he knocks on the door. After a few moments, Charlie answers the door. He stands there, somehow a bit surprised to see Dylan standing at his door way. Dylan stands frozen, staring at his father for a moment, but suddenly he breaks down in tears. Charlie rushes to him and holds him in his arms. Now Dylan is absolutely devastated and crying hard. Tears stream down his face, and his father tries to keep a serious face but we can see the tears start streaming down his face as well.

DYLAN

(Sobbing) I'm sorry, Dad, I'm so sorry...

CHARLIE

It's my fault, son. I'm so sorry for everything...

The two continue to hold each other as the camera zooms out and fades out.

END SCENE.

Dylan driving his sedan along the roads and highways on his way back to Vancouver. The music playing in the background is a sad and slow tempo song [Black Lab – Lonlely Boy]. The car drives through the dark cloudy weather, splashing through the heavy rainfall. We can Dylan in the car; he has a very depressed look on his face. His iPhone begins to ring again, this time, he picks it up without hesitation. It's Elle calling him again. He decides to let it go to voicemail. We can see the screen, it reads '4 missed calls'. Dylan puts the iPhone back on the passenger seat. The car zooms past a sign on the highway that reads 'Welcome to Vancouver in beautiful British Columbia'.

END SCENE.

INT. UBC RESIDENCE – DYLAN's DORM

The room is dim as we see the front door open and a young women walk in (ELLE). She drops her bag on the floor adjacent to the door and switches on the light. She looks down and sees Dylan's shoes and she looks confused.

ELLE

Dylan?

No response but she can see that Dylan's bedroom door is closed. There is no light coming from the space under the door frame.

ELLE

Dylan, are you home?

She walks further into the room and she sees Dylan's duffel bag on the couch. She realizes that he is home. She heads for his door, knocks and pauses for a moment. When there is no response she quickly opens the door. We can see Dylan is passed out on the bed, with beer bottles in his hand, and several other empty beer bottles around him. She rushes to him, thinking the worst.

ELLE

Dylan! Wake up!

Dylan wakes up groggily. He mumbles something to her.

ELLE

Dylan. Are you alright?

DYLAN

(angrily) Yeah, I'm fine. Perfectly fine.

Elle looks back slightly surprised.

ELLE

I called you several times. Why didn't you call back?

DYLAN

I don't need to report to you.

ELLE

I was worried; you could've called me at least once to let me know you were coming back. I would've made dinner.

DYLAN

You know, somehow I don't care anymore. (takes a swig from beer bottle)

ELLE

I thought you didn't drink.

DYLAN

Nag, nag, nag (takes another drink)

ELLE

What is up with you? You're acting like an asshole. This isn't you.

DYLAN

You don't even know me. You know what? Fuck this, I'm leaving. (He gets up and staggers out the door. After a while, we hear the front door slam shut)

Elle looks back, worried and confused. She looks down at the laptop on the desk. She sees an open word document and there is a lot of writing on the page. It is Dylan's term paper. She sits down and begins to read.

END SCENE.

INT. BAR

Dylan drinking at the bar. He sits awkwardly on the bar stool and keeps ordering drinks from the male bartender. The bartender looks sternly at him.

DYLAN

What? I asked for another. Gimme another one!

The male bartender hesitates but Dylan slaps another bill down on the table. He slowly takes the bills and pours Dylan another glass. Dylan takes some more sips and looks around the bar. His vision is very blurred and we cannot make out any face/figures in the bar. After a while, he gets up.

DYLAN

Gimme my keys.

Bartender looks very awkwardly at Dylan.

BARTERNDER

I'm sorry, I can't do that.

DYLAN

Gimme my fucking keys, asshole!

BARTENDER

(Sternly) No.

Dylan slowly staggers away muttering 'fucker' under his breath. He staggers into the crowd of the bar and bumps into a few people. Most people give him nasty looks but no one does anything. All of a sudden, Dylan runs heavily into a larger guy almost knocking him and his drink down. This time the guy looks back at his nastily.

GUY

Watch out.

DYLAN

Fuckin' move outta the way next time.

Dylan pushes the guy and the guy gets pissed and shoves him back. Dylan staggers back and moves back towards him, but this time, he doubles over and vomits all over the guy's pants. Dylan begins to laugh while the guy is really pissed now. He swings and hits Dylan. Dylan staggers back and swings, missing the guy by a few feet. The guy backs off and rolls up his sleeves.

DYLAN

(Drunkly) Oh yeah, a tough faggot, huh? Why don't you hit me, you pussy.

The guy swings and nails Dylan in the side of the face knocking him out. We see Dylan's view as he falls to the floor and his vision still blurry begins to slowly black out.

SCREEN SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK

END SCENE.

INT. CREATIVE WRITING LECTURE HALL

This scene is a montage of the lecture hall over a few weeks. We see the same professor as before teaching the creative writing class of different classes. We can see his lips move but the sound is muffled. Instead we hear music [Kelly Clarkson – Already Gone]. We see Elle sitting in the same seat as she used to sit with Dylan beside her, but this time, Dylan is not there in the class. She turns around and doesn't see Dylan anywhere in the class. Another scene: Elle sits by herself in the same seat in different clothes symbolizing another day. The professor continues to talk and Elle continues to sit alone as the music in the background continues. Another scene: Elle, in another set of clothes, sits in same seat and Dylan is still not present. The professor calls up to the class (muffled). The students get up and walk down handing in papers on the professor's front desk. Elle sits down watching all the students make their way to the front to hand in their term papers. When the last person has done so, and the class begins to walk out of the lecture hall, she slowly gets up, walks down to the front desk and hands in her paper. She looks sadly at the paper and turns around and follows the other students out of the lecture hall.

END SCENE.

INT. UBC HALLWAY – OUTSIDE CREATIVE WRITING LECTURE HALL

Elle emerges from the lecture hall and pulls out pieces of paper from her backpack. She flips open the pages and we can see writing on the papers but it is only a few pages with sparse writing. She sighs and puts the papers back into her backpack.

END SCENE.

INT. DYLAN'S DORM

Elle walks into the dorm and she sees that the place is in a mess. We can hear loud music coming from Dylan's room [Three Days Grace – Gone Forever]. She instantly heads for Dylan's room. She opens the door and Dylan is just sitting beside his bed just staring off into space.

ELLE

Where have you been the last few weeks?

DYLAN

I can't remember.

ELLE

You look like a mess. You should go clean yourself up.

DYLAN

What's the point?

Elle sighs and looks at Dylan. He looks tired and just looks very depressed. Dylan turns around and looks up at Elle.

ELLE

You can't keep living like this.

DYLAN

Why not? I can do whatever I want.

ELLE

Listen, I know you're hurt. But how do you think I feel? (Her voice begins to break just a little bit and she flips out the loose pieces of paper from her bag). How do you think it feels to know that you're in love with someone else?

Dylan pauses and then gets up.

DYLAN

(Angrily) You read my term paper?

Elle pulls out the few pages from her backpack.

ELLE

Well you never finished it, and it was due today. I was going to hand it in for you-

DYLAN

I never wanted you to hand it in. There's no point anymore. I don't want to do this shit anymore.

ELLE

I feel like I don't know you anymore.

DYLAN

You never knew me, I was lost a long time ago.

ELLE

(Angrily) I can't do this shit anymore, either.

DYLAN

Good. I was just leaving anyways.

He gets up and heads out slamming the front door once again (off screen). Elle sits down on his bed and she puts her hands in her face and cries a little. She pulls out her cell phone and begins to look through pictures of her and Dylan, back when they were happy together. She flips to the picture that we recognize from earlier, it's the one that was taken at the party. The picture shows Dylan and Elle holding each other. Elle has an amazing beaming smile and Dylan is sticking his tongue out at the camera. There is a picture of the finger painting taped to the wall behind them. Elle looks up and around the room. Dylan's posters and other paintings are torn off the walls and thrown on the ground. All expect one painting. The same painting in the picture, on the wall, the finger painting from Kindergarten. Elle looks down at the phone and she looks intently at it and then looks at the loose papers of Dylan's term paper in her hand. Her expression changes from a look of sadness into an expression of understanding.

END SCENE.

INT. BAR

Dylan sits at the end of the same bar that he was in as we saw him before. He is wearing a black leather jacket and is now clean shaven and his hair is longer now and his dark brown bangs now hang loosely over his eyes. He eyes menacingly the occupants of the bar, while sipping his drink casually. He finds a familiar face. It is the guy that he got into a fight with earlier in the story. This time he smiles and gets up with more poise. He grabs his drink and walks up casually behind the guy. Cockily he pours down the drink on top of the guy's head.

DYLAN

Oh, no you're gonna have to buy me another drink.

The guy turns around and instantly recognizes Dylan and looks back angrily at him.

GUY

You just fucking don't know when to stop do you?

DYLAN

I guess not. (Pushes the guy)

The guy gets pissed and now heads towards Dylan. This time Dylan is ready and smashes the glass onto the guy's face, knocking him aside and causing him to bleed. Dylan begins to laugh. All of a sudden, a girl who was with the guy, walks up to him, and slaps him hard in the face. Dylan slowly looks at her and she looks back into his eyes. Her eyes are quivering as she looks into his, wide eyes and slightly tearing up. Dylan's eyes look into her, at first with anger and hatred and then after a few moments his eyes soften for just a moment. He instantly turns away, hiding his face, and walks out of the bar. We can see a pained look in his face as he walks out. The crowd watches him go, as the girl kneels down and helps the guy up.

END SCENE.

EXT. STANLEY PARK

Dylan sits alone on a park bench with his hands in his jacket pocket. The weather is quite cold now as it is almost winter. We can see Dylan's breath as he exhales into the cold night air. His face shows and expression of contemplation. The dull yellow of the park lamps flows down as an ethereal blanket covering Dylan. The park is empty and the dark leafless silhouettes of the tall trees in the park tower over him, isolating him alone in the middle of the desolate park. We hear a muffled ringing, and Dylan leans forward and pulls out his iPhone. He looks at it and we can see that it is Elle calling him. He instantly hits deny. A few moments later, Elle calls again. Dylan looks down at his iPhone screen, and this time he hesitates before denying the call. A few moments later, his iPhone makes a single beep. He looks down and sees that he has received text message from Elle. He looks up and contemplates whether or not to read it. After a few moments, he decided to open it. The message is short and reads 'You always forget to turn off gps on your phone. Turn around'. Dylan gets up and we can see Elle is standing behind him. Dylan just stares blankly at Elle.

ELLE

I just wanted to say that at first, I was really mad. I really hated you for what you did.

Dylan opens his mouth to speak but she stops him.

ELLE (CONT'D)

No, let me finish. I hated you but then I started to notice things, things that you were doing unconsciously and probably never even noticed. And I want you to know, as weird as this is, but I understand how you feel. I know why you feel this way. (She sighs) I want you to know that even through all of this, I still care for you, and so I did one last thing for you. But you have to do something for me.

DYLAN

What is it?

ELLE

Head over to Prospect Point.

DYLAN

The lookout? Why? (His eyes look into hers)

ELLE

Just do this last thing for me. And you might need these.

She hands Dylan a bouquet of beautiful lavender roses that glow brightly in the dark night. Elle looks deeply into Dylan's eyes and they lock for a moment but then she turns around and walks away calmly. Dylan wants to go after her but decides not to and watches her disappear into the darkness of the trees. He looks out into the distance, into the direction of Prospect Point. He slowly starts walking towards that direction and then takes off running, and he passes a sign that read 'Stanley Park Lookout – Prospect Point' with an arrow pointing up.

END SCENE.

EXT. PROSPECT POINT

Dylan runs into the small courtyard area. There is a small railing that separates the edge from the courtyard as the view looks out into the vast fraser river and we can see the Lions Gate Bridge in the distance. We can see the tiny flickering lights from the travelling cars as they float across the thin bridge in the late hours of the night. Dylan looks around and we can see that he is alone in the courtyard. He moves towards the railing and peers over the edge but all he can see is the vast Fraser River. He sighs and looks out into the distance. A small movement in the corner of his eye causes him to turn around. He turns around and there we can see Amber standing silently next to him. She stands smiling at Dylan and we can see Dylan's expression suddenly soften and his eyes open wide in sudden wonder and amazement. He is unable to speak so she speaks first.

AMBER

Hi, Dylan.

Dylan is quiet for the longest time but he slowly turns to face her and walks up to her. She looks up into his eyes and smiles. She reaches out her hand and gently touches Dylan's hands. She looks down at the roses and brings her face closer to them a smells them. Finally he speaks.

DYLAN

I thought you hated flowers.

AMBER

I do. But I like getting them from you.

DYLAN

What changed your mind?

AMBER

This.

Amber reaches into her pocket and pulls out a picture. It is the picture from Elle's phone. It is the picture of Dylan's room taken during the party. Dylan looks at the finger painting in the background.

DYLAN

Amber, I love you, from the moment I first met you in kindergarten, for the rest of my life and forever into eternity.

She looks up back into Dylan's eyes and they stand close to each other. Their faces slowly get closer and closer to each other. Their noses touch gently and briefly and she smiles and pulls away but their heads remain touching. The wind begins to pick up and Amber's beautiful blonde hair flows all around and falls over her face. Amber closes her eyes and Dylan reaches up with his free hand and pushes the hair away from her face. He caresses her cheek and gently pulls her closer as he touches her lips softly and kisses her.

The wind begins to die down and the twinkling lights of the passing cars on the Lions Gate bridge flash in the background. All of a sudden, small snowflakes begin to fall onto the lovers from the dark night sky. The glowing white snowflakes float serenely in the cold winter air, circling around Dylan and Amber locked in their embrace.

END SCENE.

EPILOGUE

BLACK SCENE AND THEN FADE IN – 40 years later...

INT. BEDROOM

The camera slowly fades in on a bedroom. There is a slightly open window with white translucent curtains that billow out into the room as the gentle wind rolls in. There is a desk in the corner of the room and we see an older aged man sitting reading a stack of papers. He seems to be smiling. The camera focuses in on the dresser and we can see a wedding photo. A bride with beautiful flowing blonde hair stands beside a handsome brunette man who is beaming an amazing smile that just slightly pales in comparison to the smile of his stunning bride. Just adjacent to the photo is a single white origami crane, standing tall perched against the frame of the photo, with its wings extended out as if it is embracing the photo.

WOMAN (OFF SCREEN)

What's that you've got there, honey?

An older woman walks into the room and stands beside the man seated at the desk. She looks over his shoulder at the papers.

MAN

It's just something that I wrote a while ago but I guess I never finished it.

WOMAN

Well, maybe it's time you finished it?

The old man smiles and looks up at his wife. He looks deep into her eyes and says.

MAN

I love you.

The woman smiles back.

WOMAN

You've never let me forget. And I love you too.

She kisses him on the forehead and then walks out of the room. The man turns back to the papers. He shuffles the pages and puts them together in one pile, and he lays the front page on top of the papers. We can see the title of the paper: 'Final Term Paper: A Story About Life – By Dylan Taylor'. He up the stack of paper and clips them together into a folder. He opens up the drawer and pulls out a folded piece of paper. Slowly he unfolds the paper very carefully. He holds up a familiar finger painting. He stares at it for a really long time and then smiles are he folds it back into its original form and puts it into the folder with the stack of papers. The man gets up from the desk and carries the folder out the room.

The camera finds the slightly ajar window in the room, the one with the white curtains dancing in the wind.

FADE OUT.

END SCENE.

THE END
