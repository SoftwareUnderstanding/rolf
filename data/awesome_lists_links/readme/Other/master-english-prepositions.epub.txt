Foreword

Thank you for your purchase of Master English Prepositions. This book is intended for intermediate students of English. Prepositions are used to show the relationship of words. Prepositions are difficult because they have feelings rather than meanings. Mastering the feelings of prepositions is the key to becoming an advanced speaker of English.

How to Study

Each preposition will have several meanings written in [brackets]. Use these meanings to create a feeling in your mind. Study the following example:

ABOUT

[concern / regard / reason / cause / in relation to / in response to]

As you can see, there are many meanings written in the [brackets]. Combine all of these meanings in your mind to create a feeling. Do not simply tell yourself that about = concern, this is incorrect. About doesn't mean concern, it has the feeling of concern.

Each preposition feeling will have example sentences. Under each example sentence will be another way to say the same sentence without the preposition, written in italics. Some of the sentences written in italics are very unnatural, so don't use them as examples, use them to help you understand the meaning of the example sentence. Study the following example:

This book is about a prince.

The book's story concerns a prince.

Use the second italic sentence, The book's story concerns a prince, to help you understand the feeling of about in the first sentence: This book is about a prince.

Read each example sentence out loud at least five to ten times. It is very important that you always practice out loud. Try to practice three times a day, in the morning, afternoon, and at night. Try to make your own sentences using the different meanings of the prepositions. Try to make your own sentence using the idioms. It is very important that you do this if you want to improve:

1. Read out loud.

2. Study three times a day.

3. Try to make you own sentences.

Final advice: Do not be afraid of making mistakes! English speakers will still understand you even if you use the prepositions incorrectly. Mastery takes time and effort. Do not give up, do your best!
