# SPEAK TO ME

When a heart beats inside of a rabbit, one can assume that even in his stillness, even in the absence of his breath or in the muting of his cry, even in the coldness of his skin or in the vacuity of his eye, that he is, in some way, alive and if you asked him then maybe he might tell you that this was how it had always seemed in that, at no point; in all that he had seen and all that he had done and in all the fields unto which all he had run, had ever he felt like life had, in any way, already begun.

Theodore's heart thumped over and over and he followed each beat like a print in time, wondering if he was walking in slow circles towards his own intrepid finality and he saw himself in a bright orange field with hundreds of thousands of millions of bright orange flowers all swaying about under a bright orange sun which had been painted upon a bright blue sky and with every beat of his heart, a giant mechanical fist swung down from the bright invisible heavens and crushed a circle of bright orange flowers not far from where he stood and as he hopped along through the long leaves of grass; feeling the sun warming his fine fur as the bright orange flowers gently brushed his face, tickling the skin by his bushy tail, he wondered to himself, "Am I mad?"

And spurred by his yearning, to be not insane, Theodore the rabbit wished gone of the sun and prayed for deplorable rain.

"He killed himself," he said out loud in his head as if the words were another's describing how this rabbit had wound up so obviously dead.

"He's crazy."

"He's mad."

"He's bonkers."

"Confused."

"He'll never win a race with apathetic shoes."

"He's loopy."

"He's balmy."

"He's clearly insane"

"There's obviously something defunct in his brain."

And the voices repeated inside of his mind and he wished in the colour for a safe place to hide; in the greens of the grass and orange of flowers, for somewhere to burrow, a covert to cower.

And the sound of his beating heart was now pounding faster and louder and it didn't seem like any of it was ever going to end. And with every perorated thump, he stood in vacant awe as above him, through the bright blue sky came a massive crushing mechanical hammer like fist and it stretched out from the heavens and beat down on the ground with each beat of his heart a then torturous sound; pulverising, evulsing, defiling, expulsing each bright orange flower so all that was left was a cavernous breach in the earth, a colourless turn of affection, black fetid dirt.

Theodore hopped through the blades of grass and the coloured flowers trying to forget the sound of his own heart, but it was no use. For every orange flower that touched his little pink nose, a thousand more were trampled by massive swinging mechanical fists until the whole plain was swiftly raped of the entire of its colour and Theodore stood; with his little pink nose sniffing the air, by the last blade of grass that clung like a frightened child to the last orange flower which craned its neck towards the heavens in a last defiant kiss of the sun.

Looking up into the blue sky, Theodore could see the shiny silver mechanical fist gently swaying back and forth as if some fine thread were keeping it bridged to the stars; and only the finest breath would set it free, crushing down upon him.

And so he held his breath and tried to still his despotic heart and his ears filled with heavied influence from the drunken banter of stupid rabbits and then the sound of locks clicking and pockets picking and the ka-ching of the cash registers ringing like a chorus line singing that everything thought was everything told and everything taught was everything sold and each thing had a price and each price had a place and each place had a number and each number had a face and each lie could be gauged as a scholarly truth just as time unto money or age unto youth, for one and the other were thought of as real, as states to acquire or penchants to steal and the sound of it all was so loud in his head that poor old Theodore, he wished and wished he were dead.

He turned his sight from the high in the sky and he spoke to the flower with a tear in his eye and he said "I am sorry, it is who that I am, that I imagined you flower and that mechanical hand and I shouldn't have ever, imagined you alive, for all I have done is to curse you to die."

And the flower she craned with a smile and a sigh and she wiped with her petal of the winter in his eye.

"I'm not crazy," Theodore said.

The flower smiled.

Theodore looked up into the sky and he could see, riding on the mechanical fist was a small angry looking black and white striped bigot and he was screaming and drunk and he reeked and he stunk and his words they were sinking, defeating and sunk.

"You've always been mad, like most of us have, very hard to explain why you're mad," said The Badger with a moment's contemplation in a moment of hesitation, "even if you're not mad."

Theodore kissed the bright orange flower and his heart beat one last time and as he looked up into the bright blue sky where the bright orange sun played witness to the life and death of each and everyone one, he smiled and hoped that this would be some kind of an end.

# BREATHE

"Do you still see him? Is he with you, in this room?" asked The Guru.

The sound of tortured laughing and selling hands closed out in his mind as he opened his eyes and saw a small smiling monkey in comfortable sweat pants and a green and white striped turtle neck sweater standing above him as he lay on his back staring up at an image of orange flowers painted onto the ceiling of a room with brightly coloured walls; bright blue to be exact and he, lying on a white leather couch and it looked as if he were floating on a cloud looking down at the world that haunted his mind and seeing; just as The Guru had said, that he was in fact not there, that he was, above and beyond all moony transitions and that the swinging fist that haunted his imagination was merely his own reflections, caught in the breaking of wave.

Theodore looked around the room seeing colour in everything but with his caliginous eyes, finding only the grey smudges and flickers of black and white where small threads of fabric had wound away like escaping screws from the corners of chairs and the tiny scratches in the paint around the handle of the door where probably an aardvark or a ferret had accidentally brushed its claws when reaching for the poorly shaped handle.

This bothered him.

"Well?" asked The Guru.

Theodore turned his head around to the expanse of colour and accepted that they were in fact without disrupting company, just he and The Guru, alone in the theatre of self-help.

"I can't see him, no," said Theodore. "But that doesn't mean his isn't there."

"Is that what you think? That you're mysterious Badger is hiding under the sofa, behind the blinds maybe, behind my chair even."

"You wouldn't get it," said Theodore.

"Well then help me. This is what this is all about, to learn how to help ourselves so that we can help others. So help me, if he's not hiding in this room then where is he hiding?"

"Inside me," said Theodore.

The Guru made some scribbles and notes on the paper in his hands, but Theodore paid no mind. He had once concerned himself with these notes like most of The Burrowers had and still did, wanting so much for everything that he said to sound agreeable and poignant and usually the scratching of pen on paper would bring about some shrill of worry within all of the animals who laid upon this white couch but today; for Theodore, the scratching of sharpened lead on paper sounded no different to his own nails against the coarse sand out in the pits and just as his work ages his expectation and saddled his zest, so too he assumed, must the work of this brightly coloured monkey.

"Are you happy? It's ok if you're not. We all get sad you know. We all feel like we could be doing something different, our ears could be longer, our tail bushier, our nose a little pinker."

"You do hear yourself? You just described a rabbit and you said we" said, Theodore.

"I guess I did," said The Guru laughing to himself.

"And you see how that makes no sense then... because you're a monkey."

"It's a metaphor, Theodore."

"Why are we here?"

"On the moon? That's a very deep question, a very good question indeed. Why do you think we're here?"

"Is it a good question? Is it, really? It just seems so lazy you know, asking you for the answer instead of finding out for myself. Do you have the answer? Do you know anything at all?"

"You seem sad Theodore. Is your work not satisfying anymore? And sex, how is the sex?"

"See that's the thing. I know who I am, I know what I am. I know what I'm supposed to do and I know what I'm supposed to like. I see everyone else doing it and liking it, it's just, I don't know..."

"I want you to look in this mirror for me."

Theodore hopped off the couch and over to the far end of the room where the monkey was standing by what was for him an average mirror but for Theodore; a tiny white fluffy bunny, was, in fact, tremendous in its height, like catching one's reflection at the foot of a glacier.

"I want you to look into your eyes, into the inner you, the true Theodore and I want you to speak to that Theodore. I want you to say. I am Theodore, I am me, I love me and I am special. I love myself and I love being me. I am important and the things I do and say make a difference. Hurray for me, hurray, hurray, hurray."

Theodore did as The Guru asked, looking himself long in the mirror and seeing his reflection but seeing it not as he had once seen himself, seeing it older, like a face you just can't put a name to. And he seemed lost, looking into his own red eyes. He wondered; in the instant before he spoke, whether he would ever be able to find himself lost in a crowd, were it that he had found himself separated from his own self.

He said the words the way he was supposed to say them but the sound was strange and their feeling had no effect. Being a burrowing rabbit was so much different to being any other kind of rabbit and for Theodore, being a rabbit of his own making; being Theodore, was so much different to just being a conventional rabbit and he was having such a hard time at doing just that, being just like everyone else and being happy about it.

"You know I had a dog in here earlier on with the same problem. He wasn't happy either. He wanted to be like a monkey, can you believe that? And he's a canine. But it goes to show you that you're not alone, everyone has these same thoughts from time to time. We all think of ourselves differently than we truly are. And we're all the same, we're all special. We're all important and that's what matters" said The Guru.

Theodore gazed into his own reflection watching his pupils swell and recede like a black conspiring tide and he wondered if when other rabbits looked into his eyes, could they see his doubt and would they see him, as in how he felt?

Different, as in, not a rabbit.

"Honestly Theodore, I believe there is nothing wrong with you at all. You're a health young rabbit. Tell me, how many times per day are you having sex?"

"Sorry?" asked Theodore.

"Sex Theodore, how many times per day are you, you know?" asked The Guru, thrusting his hips back and forth.

Theodore looked droll in the application of his humour. His tired eyes blinked once or twice before he finally gave a slow response.

"Maybe thirty times per day. I mean, that's normal I guess, isn't it?"

"Hey, who's to say what's normal? We don't use that word around here. It's not in my vocabulary. There's no normal or expected or problem or right or wrong, everyone is unique and special here. But for a rabbit of your age, normal is anywhere from fifty to maybe a hundred times per day."

"I thought you said normal was not in your vocabulary?"

"Oh no, I was just showing a comparison of, for example, more traditional ways of exploring a problem like this whereas I treat a problem like this looking not at the problem itself but maybe, in the environment, what might be causing the problem."

"Can I go?"

"But we're not done. I still had some photos of sad rabbits saying depressive sentiments. It was going to be next and..."

"I'd really like to get back to work. I'm ok, really I am. Look, I'm happy, see" he said, wearing a limber oversized smile like a young child would, their father's coat.

"You know life is like a..."

"A what?" asked Theodore.

"Oh, where is it?"

"What did you lose?"

"I had a card here. It was a white card. It had all my closing proverbs. I left it right here. You didn't see it did you?"

"No, I didn't. But that's ok. Maybe next time."

"No, it's not ok. There's a science to this. You're supposed to finish on a life quote. I have to conclude the session."

"Well, can't you just give me one off your head or something?"

"I don't have one off the top of my head. I keep them on the white card. That's what the white card is for but my stupid receptionist. Ugh, she angers me sometimes. She just moves things about like it's her place."

"Relax Guru, it's fine. I don't think life really offers any real conclusions anyway, not the kind we're hoping or expecting."

"Just give me a second. The quote is great. It's about life and everything being in balance and... it's here somewhere, I know it" said The Guru.

"Listen, I'm feeling kind of randy so I might go and have some sex now but later, when you find it, you can read me that quote, deal?"

"Sure, yeah that's a good idea, deal. Hey, have great sex."

Theodore stepped on a small button by the right of the door and the small button pressed down and the lock clicked and the door paused open and Theodore hopped out into the hallway and headed off back along through the winding corridors passing hundreds of unmarked doors on his way back into the tunnels to continue his work.

"Theodore" yelled The Guru down the corridor.

Theodore stopped and turned his little bunny head.

"Breathe" he shouted.

"What?" yelled Theodore.

"Breathe in the air" The Guru shouted. "When it gets heavy and you're thinking old in your mind and you feel long in your step, remember to breathe, nothing else, just breathe in the air. And yoga. Do your yoga. It will even out your soul. More yoga, ok? Oh and hey, you're special and I love you."

"Ok," said Theodore dryly.

"Oh, and don't be afraid to care. The things you love, they won't leave you, not if you love them and you love yourself enough for them to want to stay. Breathe, Theodore, just breathe" shouted The Guru.

Theodore turned away again and hopped off down the hallway and waited by a large sign of a burrowing rabbit by a large metal track. On his way, he caught the eye of a raggedy but pretty rabbit looking at him with strange affection. And it could have been hunger in her eye or it could have something entirely else and as he hopped past, he looked in her direction as he did every time he passed her stop and he wished he could have done something other than pretending that he hadn't seen her stare.

What a stupid rabbit thing to do.

Beside him; spaced generously, where many more signs stretched out the length of the track before him and each sign housed a different animal; some large some large and some insectually small.

Before each sign stood the animal or insect that was no different as the image itself and all of the animals huddled together and they bickered and they shoved and they pushed one another around, desperately vying to be first to board the afternoon train.

Along the line of the track, waiting for the first carriage down to the last was the order in which the animals were needed, respected and unto the moon, gave their service. The dogs were first, taking the most comfortable of the carriages and the least labour of the work. It had been better, according to the monkeys, to give passage and the right to the dogs so that they wouldn't eat and make bloodied toys out of all the smaller and more functional animals. The dogs did very little, so better then that the little they did be somewhere upon where there very little did no harm.

Theodore waited with the other rabbits towards about half way down the track waiting for one of the middle carriages. His herd mingled with the dirty paws; the quick talking foxes, the savage and conniving ferrets and the armadillos, which bruised their way to the top of this bottom rung of burrowers. They were paid handsomely and lived a respectful title and position in society, admired but not revered, lesser than the dog and the mole but still higher than The Feelers, those worms and spiders and colonies of ants that tunneled their way through the broken rock, reporting on what may or may not lay ahead.

"Has the afternoon train passed?" said The Mole.

"Not yet," said Theodore.

"What are you doing? You're talking to a mole? Are you insane? Are you mad?" yelled a rabbit beside him.

Theodore hadn't even noticed. Beside him stood a massive creature. Massive compared to him anyway. It was a large brown mole and he was probably lost. Moles were the only animals of whom the signs bayed little importance and they were the most proficient Diggers of them all and the rule said that one could have a mole next to him, but one could never be next to a mole and though a mole might ask one a question, one should never assume that they are expected to respond, not with what they can or cannot see, for how would an animal with eyes ever compare what it cannot see with animal that has never seen before. Thus, the moral right was to pitter patter away.

But Theodore didn't care too much.

"It's coming now," said The Mole.

Theodore looked around, but he couldn't see anything. The other rabbits looked too and they took the words of The Mole like those of some ancient mystic and the sound of its voice rattled about like cellophane in a light breeze making all of the rabbits feel uneasy and unsettled as they peered over one another to their right, looking into the darkness and then, just as they were about to shrug off his wisdom, from out of nowhere came the thunderous horn and the rattling of the scores of carriages being dragged through the dark tunnel.

"He was right," said one rabbit.

"They're always right," said another.

"It's magic."

"It's mystical."

"They're sorcerers. Blind sorcerers."

"Shhh, they can hear everything, even your thoughts."

"You're idiots," said Theodore, stepping onto the train as it came to a stop and the doors opened.

He thought about helping the blind mole get aboard but then, he really didn't care all too much so he hopped onto a seat and stared out the window while hundreds of other rabbits piled upon one another, squeezing into every vacant spot.

The train rattled as the door closed and then a siren sounded and the engines started and the train went returned from whence it came, moving slowly at first and then racing down through the tunnels and towards the digging zones near the centre of the moon and as the train sped along, the carriage full of rabbits exploded with converse and shouting and expletive cursing and then as if someone had just flicked a switch, it became a carriage of rampant sex as the rabbits; piled upon one another, engaged in their second favourite past time.

Theodore though just stared out of the window and thought how strange this all seemed. Yet, he had not known anything more different to have ever made him feel this way so how strange it was then, to not know why it was that he felt that everything seemed so patently strange and this was what cursed him, what caused him to feel so different and mad because he had no words at all, nothing had been taught to him to express that the life that he knew and that the role he was born to play, the purpose he would fulfill and the life unto which he drudge his way through was, in some unspeakable sense, absolutely and entirely wrong.

But he had no words.

He had not been educated to think this way and to speak only of what he thought and so this feeling of which burned inside of him, it burned and nothing more. The pain never ceased and its calling never lessened. And though all he needed and all that he wished was to have the way or the meaning or the words to simply say just how he felt, with what he had, which was nothing at all, all he could do was to say "I fell a little bit strange" and for that, for having a feeling with no name, a meaning with no words, he was undeniably mad.

The train arrived at the station deep in the tunnels after some arduous time alone with his thoughts and in that time he had cursed himself a thousand times over and thousand times more and he had listened and fended the mockery and taunting jeers of his common peers, cackling like drunken witches in his mind; the type of laughter that wouldn't just get under your skin, if left unattended, it would peel it right off.

And in the time it took for his thoughts to turn on him, his companions, his fellow rabbit commuters had copulated some scores and tens of scores of times and they all hopped off of the train with some obvious perk and spring in their step and none of them looked tired, not for an inch of the sex they had just consumed.

The rabbits all poured down into the caverns and took to their obligation, savouring nothing more than digging their dirty little paws into the moon rock and burrowing away as they did, throughout each and every day. Theodore plodded along slowly feeling as if the spring he was told he should have, were rusted so that when he moved his little paws and his little legs, he was pained up along his back and in his mind and it felt like the feeling was burrowing its way inside his mind and he wondered if there were an animal or a sentiment like he, inside his mind right now, with its duty to burrow until it had found some appeasing light and he wondered if that sentiment felt as heavy as he felt now and maybe that was why he felt so heavy, for he was labored by a sentiment that was feeling sad, for it too had a sentiment of its own that had grown tired and strange to its purpose.

The siren sounded.

The rabbits all started their burrowing and they all sang out loud in contented harmony as their little paws and tiny claws scraped at the rock and dug into the dirt and shifted piles of grey moon sand behind them.

"Hey you."

It was Florence, Theodore's girlfriend.

"Do you want to burrow with me today?"

There was a perfect response, the perfect word he was looking for that would best represent the aversive feeling in his stomach. What was it?

"Sure," he said.

That wasn't it.

"Theodore I've been thinking. You know, maybe it's time we looked at maybe moving in together. You know, we're not getting any younger and, you know..."

And she said 'you know' like she was attaching some whimsy towards every ideal just so she could back her way out of it, should in the light of its saying, it be wrong or not agreeable.

Theodore hated it.

"So anyway, were going to Irene and Steven's engagement on Friday and I thought, you know, maybe we could have some news for ourselves because I really want to have something to tell everyone and you know, nothing really much has happened and I love Irene, she's like my sister but I really want some attention for myself, you know? Theodore?"

"What are we doing?" he asked.

"Burrowing," she said.

"No, us," he said.

"We're burrowing," she said.

"Are you happy?"

"Of course hunny bunny. Aren't you?"

Theodore paused for a moment. He saw his entire life, scratched into the face of a grey moon rock and he could see, etched in the sand, the footprints of the rabbit he pretended to love and the friends he pretended to admire, having all been partied about him throughout the entirety of this farce, cheering him along.

"I am, yes."

There it was. Those contrary words, the complete irregular meaning to the opposition he felt in his stomach and what was it that made him this way? What made him so horribly, polite?

"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I was having sex with these guys earlier this morning and they were telling me about this great band we have to check out, you're gonna love it. Apparently they're really good. You guys could maybe try to introduce yourself you know and try to get a gig with them; it'd be great for you. They have like, the new sound, you know, like apparently it's the next thing. We should really go. Ok, we'll go. I'll call Irene and Steven and we'll get Greg and Tracy too and Yvette and Jonathon and oohh, what's that guy's name? You know the one? He has that like limp kind of when he hops, you know."

He could of known and maybe he did but he went somewhere else in his mind when she said that they, for the last ten years, had been burrowing and what a thing he thought, to be digging away at oneself, looking for nothing in particular.

Florence kept talking. She couldn't stop. Her little bunny mouth moved up and down like talking mouths did, but it didn't at all sound like she was speaking. It sounded like a truck reversing and that's how every word sang to him, like a warning, telling him to keep his distance and be careful when overtaking.

"No," he said.

"And it was so big I just couldn't believe myself I mean, you won't believe me if I tell you and really you had to be there to understand what I'm talking about, words really don't suffice but I'm gonna tell you anyway cause I mean, you know, you're never gonna get an opportunity like this ever again, not for this type of thing and...."

"No," he said.

"I didn't ask you anything silly billy."

"No."

"No what?"

"No to this, no to that. No to what you didn't ask me. No to what you will. No to what you haven't said and no to what you'll never say. No, no, no. Just no."

"Am I missing something Theodore?

"Yes, yes you are. You're missing so much."

"You're scaring me, Theodore, are you ok? You look...... sad" she said.

"No."

"No what Theodore."

"No, I'm not happy but I'm not sad either, I'm just... blahh"

"Do you want me to hug you?"

"Not particularly no."

"Do you want to have sex?"

"I'm bored with sex, of doing it all the time, it's just become.... blahh"

"But it's what we do."

"And I'm tired of all of that too."

"Do you want me to call someone. You should speak to The Guru."

"I did."

"Oh did he show you that picture of the sad bunny, you know, the really pretty one and she had like a tattoo or ink or something on her arm and her face and it said 'I feel ugly' and 'I'm not good enough' and there was more stuff as well but I can't' remember what it said but it was so effective. I saw that and just went wow, like it was so moving and deep because it's not just untalented people who feel like they don't have talent because there's other rabbits too, like really pretty ones you know? I felt so good about myself. Whoever made that picture should get a reward or something it was just like so moving."

"Yeah I think I'm not gonna do it anymore."

"What are you on about?"

"Everything. The self-help, the exercises, the dieting, the book club, the yoga."

"The yoga? You want to stop yoga? But how will you attain corporal and spiritual balance? I mean, you can't just stop you know?"

"I think I will. I think today was my last day. Yeah, I'm gonna stop."

"Theodore you sound crazy, I mean this is how a crazy rabbit would sound, you know?"

"I think I need something different."

"But what? Everything that there is is everything that we do. What else could there be?"

"I guess I wanna find something, anything."

"Did you do the mirror exercises? Oh, they always cheer me up when I remind myself how unique and special I am."

"You see, that's the thing. If everyone is so unique and special then it goes to say that being unique and special is something common and if that's the case then you're just back to being ordinary again."

"You really are sad."

"I'm not sad. I told you. I feel empty, deflated, like my body is too big and deformed for my soul if I even have one."

"Now that's crazy talk hunny bunny. You just need to see The Guru. Trust me, self-help cures all ailments, even the ones in your mind, you know. It's like food for the soul."

"My soul is starving."

"Well then, have a slice of Zen pie."

"It doesn't work."

"Of course it does, it's soul food."

"Self-help and those stupid proverbs, they do nothing. Soul food? It's like trying to cure starvation with a sugar cube. It might taste sweet on the lips but once it dissolves, the emptiness is still there."

"I don't know what to say."

"Nothing will suffice."

"We should start burrowing. If we don't get some distance done we won't get our rewards. Where should we start? I think tunnel 186B will be great. What do you think?"

"They're all the same. They all go in the same direction. Does it matter?"

"Breathe Theodore. Just stop hopping, for one second."

Florence gripped his fluffy fur and dug her little claws into the grey soil, keeping him from hopping away.

"Breathe."

"Why does everyone keep saying that?"

"Just breathe Theodore, breathe in the air."

Theodore stopped his rant. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe this was just some virus. The two hopped together down through a series of tunnels heading towards 186B but when they neared the right door and as they passed a small group of beggars, Theodore had a change in his heart and change in his direction.

They stopped by a young rabbit who was mangy in his appearance, his fur all tattered and knotted, not of any specific breed at all, just a blemish in their direction.

"Please, sir. I'm ever so hungry. Just one penny would do" the young rabbit said.

Theodore put his hands in his pockets and though they jingled the tune of a rich rabbit, he held the coins in his grasp and shook his shoulders and his instinct said, "No, I don't have anything, maybe next time kid."

And they hopped along.

Florence opened the door to usher her boyfriend through, but Theodore just looked at her as if he couldn't understand a single word she was saying.

He turned and went through the door beside him, to the left.

"Theodore" she screamed. "We only burrow on the right. Theodore, what are you doing? Theodore, are you mad?"

The door closed behind him and he found himself somewhere he had never imagined being.

# ON THE RUN

"Run, quickly, there's little time," said The Badger.

"Who are you, where are we running to?"

"Not we, but you. Quick, you might be late."

"For what?"

"There's no time to say. Not here, but you should run. Look, you're getting ahead of yourself and you've not even tied your laces."

Ahead of him, a small rabbit ran.

Theodore hopped away, digging his claws deep into the sand and leaping long into every stride, chasing the every step of the animal before him, trying in vain to keep up. The tunnel was brightly lit, so bright it was blinding and he could only see the small animal he was chasing as a motion blur through the haze of kicking dust as both animals wound down and along the tunnel, hopping and skipping over stones and dodging and weaving around the sharp sticks and buzzing red lights that stuck out of the ceiling and Theodore could hear the sounds of laughter encasing him and it sounded like some great machine, machined by some great dictator were hot on his tail, pounding upon his every last step and he bound and he bound while the lights above and around, they spun and they turned and they cycled around and around and all he could see was a bright flashing blur of blinding bright whites and cautioning yellows and flashing reds and sirens and bellows and old men's laughter and the sound of his own heart beating so fast that it might just skip out from his chest and what then if it did and he raced and he roared and above him, the sound of engines and rotors soared and about him, the sound of footsteps and screaming and shouting and sirens were sounding and he raced forwards, his sight grazed by the millions of thousands of billions of tiny dust particles kicked up by the animal leading him through the blinding light, away from whatever was scented to their flight.

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"What? Who are you? What do you mean?" shouted Theodore, his voice breaking as his lungs fought to build enough air to shape the words.

The footsteps were all around him now. Marching feet. Late and delayed marching feet. Desperately moving, stampeding, marching feet; all about him, coming from great heights and slapping at the ground by his tail, scraping against the wall by his side and hammering down on the grey dusted ground that danced and moldered by his straining red eyes.

"Please, slow down. Wait for me" he shouted.

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"Wait. I'm coming. Please wait for me. Please" he shouted.

"Live for today."

"Don't leave me behind" he shouted.

"Gone tomorrow."

"Please," he shouted.

"Hahahahahah."

"Stop" he shouted.

"Live for today."

"I can't breathe" he shouted.

"Gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"I can't breathe" he shouted.

The small animal didn't stop, though, it just kept winding and dodging its way through and along the blinding white tunnel and Theodore had no shout at all left in his voice. He ran as fast as he could, but he couldn't keep up.

"Stop" he yelled.

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

Theodore ran.

He closed his eyes to shut out the bright blinding white light, but it was no use. The light was not in his eyes, it was in his mind and the walls of the tunnel still turned like some mixing machine and he ran as if some magnificent amount of slurry were being toppled and turned and should he slow for second, it might catch up on him and swallow him whole and so he ran and he tried to ignore the channel of laughter and repeated taunting that echoed about him and he ran, trying to keep up with the small animal that was always just ahead of his crying voice and he ran.

He ran towards what he could not keep up with and he ran from, what he could not escape and then he heard the sounds of flights being called, numbers being read and then the sound of footsteps and marching that now paraded about his senses seemed all the more desperate and lated and they rushed about faster and with less restraint and less concern for whom they left behind and he felt as if they could crush him at any second, but his heart kept beating and his tiny lungs pulled enough air to keep his engines turning and he ran, he ran so fast, but not fast enough.

"Live for today."

"Gone tomorrow."

"Hahahahaha."

"Shut up" screamed Theodore.

"Live for tomorrow."

"Gone today."

"Hahahahaha."

"Breathe Theodore."

"Yes breathe."

"Breathe in the air."

"Live for today."

"Gone is the air."

"That's me."

"Hahahahaha."

"Wait for me, please. Please don't leave me" yelled Theodore.

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"Breathe, breathe in the air."

"Forget the sun."

"Hahahahaha."

"Live for today."

"Forget the sun."

"Gone for today, hahahahaha, that's me."

"I'm not here tomorrow."

"Live for the sun, breathe tomorrow."

"That's me, hahahahaha."

"Forget the sun"

"Dig that hole."

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"Get the sun."

"Wait for me please" yelled Theodore.

"Run rabbit, run."

"Forget the sun"

"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, hahahahaha."

"Please" yelled Theodore.

"Run rabbit, run."

"Hahahahaha."

"Stop" Theodore screamed.

He stopped.

His paws were cut and bleeding.

His will was spent; defeating.

He lay his little bunny head down on the grey sand and the lights they all turned about him but they slowed and they slowed and the sounds of marching feet; late and delayed and rushing marching feet, they all slowed too and his heart, it, pounding so hard in his chest but it too slowed and the blinding bright white lights, they shunned away and his eyes could see the small animal just ahead of his fleeting voice and he had no shout left, he had no yell, he had no scream and he had no whisper, he had barely a look in his eye.

And the animal was he and it looked at him and it was he, looking at himself and he had no idea what he had wanted, why he had wanted himself to run and he had never any idea, in the entirety of his life, what he had ever wanted of himself.

Theodore had not a word to say, not to himself anyway. He just stared as his eyes heavied and his breath slowed and his consciousness waned. The animal he was chasing, the one staring at him, the rabbit, himself, scratched at an itch behind his ear.

Theodore closed his eyes.

His breath stopped.

Darkness became everything.

The rabbit, the other he, prepared to speak.

Theodore listened.

"It's time," said he, unto himself.

# TIME

"Wake up Theodore."

"He's a heavy sleeper."

"Is he unconscious or sleeping?"

"Dip his paw in water."

"Use a chime."

"Yes, set the alarm, let's have some fun."

"Wake up hunny bunny, it's me, Florence. Hunny?"

"Is he alive?"

"Well, he is breathing."

"That doesn't prove anything."

"Shake him."

"Theodore, wake up, it's time Theodore."

"It's not working; he's in some kind of a trance or something."

Theodore was slouched against the back of the door in which he had entered. His friends circled about him slapping his face and trying to return some colour to his pale expression. He was breathing and his eyes were ajar, but his eyes looked like two dark spheres, staring off into nowhere and obvious of nothing happening around him.

"Should we call someone?"

"No. Just wait. I've seen him like this before. Just give it a minute or so. If need be we'll sneak him back to quarters. Just give him some air."

The rabbits all leaned in and started blowing air on his face while beside them; Florence fanned their efforts with a small piece of folded paper.

"I think it's working, look his face is wrinkling. More, give him some more air."

The rabbits all huffed and puffed and blew the warm musky tunnel air into Theodore's face and with it carried the particles of dust swept up by their shuffling feet and the tiny bits of dust and moon granite; directed by the rabbits' blowing breaths, filled the cracks in Theodore's eyes, itching him into conscious frustration.

He scratched at his eye and he winced and he cursed, pushing his friends out of his way as he jumped back onto his hind legs and fought to free his sight from the swirling dust about his face.

"We have to go" shouted Theodore.

The other rabbits all looked at each other strangely.

"What are you talking about man?"

"Yeah, relax dude, chill ok? You're freaking out is all."

"You scared me, Theodore. But you're ok now. Must have been a stroke or something. Do you feel ok hunny bunny?"

Theodore stared into the eyes he had known for a decade and yet, it seemed like it was the first time he had ever seen himself looking back, in her reflection. And the look on his face was of pure suspension, of haggard disbelief and he wondered if this was how he had always seemed when he was adrift in the current of her attention; bedding in her affectionate detention.

"What happened man?" asked Rex.

Theodore looked at his friend Rex, a rabbit he had known since he was just a child. And he saw no youth in him whatsoever. And his other friends too, all of them looking over in strange wonder, they too looked so very old and so different to the sound of their voices.

"Did you take some bad acid man?"

Theodore looked at Rex with a riotous stare.

"How did you even get in here? Look at this place. What is it?" said Rex.

"It's like a storage room or something," said another rabbit.

"There's a tunnel," said Theodore.

"What tunnel?" asked Rex.

"There up ahead. I was just running through it."

"I think you got some dust in your eye man, there aint no tunnel here. Look around."

Theodore wiped his eyes and his eyes atoned with the darkness and he could see that the room was no bigger than his closet, just a square meter or two with four enclosing walls, a low roof, not a blinding bright white light in sight, no tunnel for him to have found himself sprinting, nothing, except for a few scratches in the grey moon granite where he sat.

"What were you doing here?"

"I just felt like it, I guess. Did you see anyone in here with me? Another rabbit? It looked like me? Did you see it?"

"It's just you hunny bunny. I think we should get you home."

"I must not let them know I'm crazy," he thought.

He shook his back thoroughly sending more dust into the air and clearing his thoughts of the sound of chiming that was still ringing in his ears.

"What time is it?" he said.

"It's the end of the day, come on, we'll get you home," said Rex.

The rabbits opened the door and looked quickly down the hall to make sure there were no authorities patrolling to counter their sneaking about. As his friends walked up the hallway, Theodore looked back through the left door and into the room where he had been.

It was nothing like he had imagined it and everything like his friends told him that it was. The walls were close and claustrophobic and the room itself was darker than his own perceived imagination.

Where were the lights?

Where were the stampeding lated feet?

Where were the death machines and the sirens of their imminence?

Where was the small animal?

Where was he?

He closed the door and followed his friends along the hallway and out onto the train platforms. The terminal was abuzz with energy and zest and expectation and all of it hinged on so very little; a book to read, a movie to watch or somewhere to sit and drink away their idealistic wishing into a common slur of drunken accusation and unforeseen apology.

"Tonight is gonna be fantastic. Have you heard of these guys?" asked Rex.

"What are you talking about?"

"The Band. Man, what a name, what a band. You're gonna love em. That's what everyone is saying."

"Listen I might give it a miss. I'm really tired. I think I'll just kick around at home. Maybe I'll write something."

"A new song?" asked Rex enthusiastically.

"My book," said Theodore.

"Hey, good for you man. That's great. I can't wait to read your book man. How much have you got written so far?"

Theodore looked pestered by his care.

"It's difficult. I start and then I start again and you know, I just want it to be perfect. I'm a perfectionist."

"What's it about?"

"I don't know really. It's hard to explain."

"Wow, sounds great. Listen if you change your mind, we'll be at the bar until around midnight. We can come and pick you up if you like."

"What are you doing?" Theodore asked Florence.

"I might go with them."

"Ok."

"Well, I'll sit with you on until you get off, ok hunny bunny?"

"Fine," said, Theodore.

The train pulled up and hundreds of rabbit all scampered aboard and they all climbed and scuttled over one another, some looking for someplace comfortable to curl up for a brief nap while others indulged in just another frisky encounter.

Theodore watched as Florence did just that, hopping away from him as he sat by the shaking door and joining a group of rabbits she knew from school that she hadn't had sex with in years and she called out to Theodore inviting him to be a little more sociable but when he shrugged her off, she went back to catching up with her old friends.

"This is not what I imagined."

Theodore was staring into the horned rabbits watching blandly as his lover sexed with an awesome sum of strangers and he felt both no desire to join her, no will to have it stopped or no irking for him to turn away. He felt like an incomplete sentence, without adjective, and of no admiring or telling context whatsoever and so he stared at rabbits doing what rabbits did and he thought nothing of it.

"What did you imagine?" asked Rex.

"I always thought something was gonna happen, something grand, something different. I've been waiting; my whole life, for something to happen. Haven't you? I mean, do you feel grown up? Do you feel responsible? And what the hell is that supposed to feel like?"

"I dunno. I never really thought about it I guess."

"Seriously. I've been waiting to feel different, not the way I've always felt. I thought that when we finished school we would think different, that knowledge was something we could wear, like when you put on a jumper and you feel warm, you take it off and you feel cold so you know when you have it on and you feel good for having it on and you use it specifically in places where it pays to have it on, so you're thankful that you have it and that too feels good. A warm jumper or a cozy blanket on a freezing night are bliss. You can't deny that you are wearing either of them but everything else, I mean, being a responsible rabbit, having a career, being successful, they don't feel like anything. Do you remember when we started out?"

"I try not to, no. Man, those days were tough. You shouldn't think about that kind of stuff. Try to think positive. You're a handsome rabbit; you're dating a beautiful bunny, hell I can see you guys getting married one day you know, settling down, monogamous sex, children, secure investments, the works. You should be happy, man, she's a great catch. You think too much, that's all. Have you seen The Guru lately? You should book an appointment, seriously. He has this great picture now of this sad bunny rabbit and she has all these real depressing words scribbled about her and it's really thought provoking, you know?"

Theodore looked right into his friend's eyes and then through him. He wondered what words might be scrawled upon his belly should anyone dare to take a photo.

"We're getting older and I'm still here, waiting. And the worst part is I have no idea what I'm waiting for. I felt like this when I was two and again when I was five and again when I was nine and still feel this way and I imagine that this is probably the type of thing you think about just before you die, that you've always felt like you were supposed to change, that something was supposed to happen and even though a lot of things happened, really, in the end, none of them actually did. I mean what do we do all day?"

"We burrow."

"For what?"

"To get the sun."

"How many years have we been burrowing? How many years have we been digging our paws into this blasted moon? What if there is no sun? What if we can't dig through? Are you ok living your life in a tunnel, probably dying without knowing if the extent of your labour had worth or purpose? Doesn't that concern you?"

"I don't think about it, Theodore. I burrow because that's what I do. It's what we do. We're rabbits and rabbits burrow and we have a purpose. It's enough to believe that there will be a sun on the other side. Do I think there is a sun? Of course there is, there has to be?"

"Why, Why does there have to be? Prove to me that there is."

"Prove to me that there isn't. This is hope, Theodore."

"It sounds stupid to me."

"Well if there's no sun then why are you doing it? There has to be a light side of the moon. There has to be. I believe in it and I don't care if you don't. Look can we talk about something else?"

"The only thing that ever changes is the colour of my petals."

"What?"

"Nothing."

"What were you doing in that room?"

Theodore's desire to respond felt as small and empty as where he was found.

"Burrowing," he said.

"So you're not coming to the show then?" asked Rex ending the debate.

Theodore looked at Rex with a tired expression.

"No," he said. "I won't be going to the show."

A small mangy rabbit hobbled up towards Theodore and Rex and stopped just shy of their kicking paws and he held out his own with his sad eyes sinking deeper than a pirate's treasure, anchored towards his sad little paws that were all dirty and his claws, chipped and worn away.

"Please sirs, I am so hungry. I do not want your money, just a crumb or even; if you can spare it, the bits of food that catch in the corners of your mouths and in the joins of your teeth."

It was amazing how a rabbit's eyes could seem so large and eclipsing when they were sad or feigning a great sadness and Theodore pushed his hands into his pockets and felt and heard the mashing of silver coins and there must have been some educated magnet inside his pants being controlled by his mind because as much as he felt some primal desire to help this starving rabbit, he couldn't lift his hands from his pockets and he felt like he was dreaming as if he needed to scream but every time he opened his mouth, it would offer him no service.

And he felt exactly like this right now, having a burning desire to give and an educated recurrence to give not.

Theodore shook his head in some automated display as if he were shooing a fly or fending a wayward drunk; some vial pestilence or a physical and terminal threat. But this poor little rabbit was neither and the threat in itself was the feeling that he had deep down inside of him.

"We don't have any money. Go away. Go on, get" shouted Rex.

Theodore's hand clenched the coins and he imagined that he had the courage, should the small starving rabbit return, to pull the coins from his pocket and give them to the tiny beggar because that was what he wanted to do but it was not what he was capable of doing and so, as the small starving rabbit turned away and hobbled along the train looking for some congenial red eyes, Theodore followed him with his own sight and said nothing. He held onto the coins, promising to give them away should young and hungry rabbit simply turn in his direction. But he had no voice to call out to assist and so he imagined it had all been very different.

"You see, this is what I've been talking about all along. The government should be doing something about these poor rabbits. It's not fair that they hobble around train by train with their big sad eyes and their grumbling bellies with their paws out begging for scraps and money. It's not fair. I mean, I work hard for my money and they just have to sit around all day feeling sorry for themselves, blaming everyone else for their plight. And you know they're just lazy. They don't want responsibility. It's easy to be poor. You just sit on your bum all day long with your hands in their air. Try working, doing something for a living, having something at stake. Everyone wants something for nothing. Don't you think?"

Theodore said nothing.

He might have agreed on some learned principle, but he couldn't mouth a single word. He felt in every way, abstract. And so he clung to the coins in his pocket as if they were all that he had and all of the meaning he had every known were now scrunched in his little bunny hands and he wished he had the gall to just throw all of it away, but in no direction other than someone else's face.

The train pulled into the station and Theodore said nothing as he hopped away from his seat and ignored the waving and air kissing of his girlfriend and the air slapping of his friends as his little paws touched the cold marble of the station and an air-conditioned breeze swept through the caging tunnels and he thought he could see, in the midst of the black, there just beyond the headlights of the train, deep within the cavernous tunnel, a small and pudgy and hostile looking face, staring right into his eyes.

"Hey Theo, remember we have that show on tomorrow night. Don't you flip out on me. I need my vocalist on fire. I'll pick up round seven. I can feel it, man, this is gonna be the one. We're gonna get signed I can feel it. We're gonna be rich baby" shouted Rex as the train's doors closed and the giant mechanical carrying thing shuffled off into the dark tunnel.

He stayed for a second looking into the tunnel and looking for that black and white face, the one that had been haunting him for so long, the one that had been busy undoing the years of his sure binding. He looked at where he had seen The Badger staring back at him, but the feeling of acrimonious spying was now gone as the darkness was no longer perturbed by that cranky old badger and his belligerent complaining eyes.

But he wished The Badger were still there.

And so he walked in a way that was like a cripple dragging himself back to his waiting chair and it looked as if the imaginary springs that all rabbits seemed to possess were; in Theodore, neglected or omitting.

There was a strong gale blowing through the vents. Theodore brushed up his fur and shivered away the cold that dampened his skin. He went to undo the locks to his apartment like he always did; taking the key from around his neck and holding it so the bottom was at three o'clock so it would need one swift and slight turn to slide into its place at six.

Theodore pushed his hand towards the lock and the pressed against twelve and six and it slid straight in and he stopped for a second and he lowered his little paw and he stared at the lock and watched the shiny and silver 'T' dangling from the end of a chain that was tied to a ring that wound through the key itself and it swung back and forth like a pendulum and it ticked and it clicked as it spun to and fro like the beating heart of a grandfather clock and his eyes followed; to the left and to the right, and as it slowed, so too did the racing that had been dashing about in his mind.

He had never turned a key from twelve to six. Not once in his life had ever he encountered something as aberrantly rare as this.

He thought about Florence and he imagined her being someone whose name was only brought up in some past tense and how perfect that past would be if her act had ended and he had staged some new obsession since that ending to now when he was looking back with distant appreciation. And as he thought about her as someone he had known and as someone whose burdens he had once attended to as his very own, he didn't think about her with any consolidated feelings whatsoever.

He saw her face as an event, as a period of time or a group of periods of time; spent time, wasted time, time wished away, time spent waiting for something to start, for something better to come.

He wondered how far he would have to turn his paw to move the key from twelve to six. Would he need to turn the key twice? Or could he do it in just one twist?

The pendulated 'T' slowly drew its swing to a fancy stillness. Theodore stared through the silver letter at a splinter in his door that was sticking out of the frame. The door was blue but the splinter underneath; in the part that had broken away, was painted a different colour.

Though it was undeniable that the door was blue, it appeared to him now that it had once been black.

"Good evening Theodore."

He could hear the voice and he knew the face that had shaped the words so he felt no pining to turn around. He nodded his head, still staring at the oddly coloured slinter sticking out from the door.

"Tis a fine evening to be coming home, wouldn't you say?"

He said nothing.

He lifted his paw to the key and turned and the door opened without a single twist, creeping open, spilling free of his unready paws. And then; as he stood beneath the towering frame, an eerie silence wept upon his ears.

He hadn't locked the door.

He went in and sat down in front of the fireplace. He always left enough wood to burn through a working day so that when he returned he would only need to gently place a handful of kindling or a small yet generous piece of wood to bring the fire back from the breath of extinction and bring a subtle texture to the dim light within his apartment and he sat in front of the fire warming the pads at the bottom of his paws and his fur brushed and shivered as the warm air massaged his freezing skin and he listened to the sound of raindrops from an old tape machine for there was nothing more soothing than the sound of rain from inside of one's cozy warm home.

Then, through the sound of light rain splashing against slippery stone came the deafening chorus of bells tolling in their hundreds and thousands; the sound of shapely metal being clamored and hammered and oh the bells they rang and they clanged and they dinged and they sang and it was less like a song and more like an obliging verse and faces pressed against front paws and eyes looked to the front and important things were surely about to be said.

Theodore turned on the television and the light stung his eyes and the sound of the anchor quizzing an engineer about a recent collapse in one of the sub tunnels, it caused an uncomfortable concern to his ears and he tried to change the channel and to dim the light but the buttons; though pressing, had no effect and as much as he slapped the control against the palm of his paw, nothing was doing.

The batteries were dead.

The news then flashed images of new tunnels being burrowed and they believed that we might have passed the core and that from that point on, it would be a short travel away from reaching the other side and channeling the sun's light through. The anchor and the engineer looked thrilled and their eyes lit up like neon lights as they exchanged congratulatory glances.

The television then played a popular meme; an image of a beautiful looking rabbit, her hair tied in a pretty pink bow, her lips glossed red and her long lashes, like sexual whips, painted midnight black, half closed as if she were bowing into a blush and her cheeks were just the slightest bit red and her lips were full and alluring and her eyes; though partly shaded by her lashing lashes, spoke of contradiction for she was a thing of beauty yet according to the words etched on and about her, she felt not as if others imagined her being.

She was beautiful yes, but the words on her chest said that here breasts were too small and she was striking yes, but the words on her paws read 'weak' and 'fragile' and should she open her mouth the world would surely listen but on her lips it was written 'I'm afraid I have nothing to say' and in her paws was a sign; a simple white card, with the words 'I'm ugly' and 'life, is to hard'.

Theodore didn't see the television. He was pouring himself a glass of whiskey and looking at a white page sitting on the table and beside it a black pen that was splotching ink from its tip onto the bottom of the page. He drank from his glass and placed it down on the table and sat in front of the blank page. He tried to think of something to write but his mind felt stained and so he scrunched the paper up into a ball and lay the pen back down on the table with its tip drawn upon a corner of another blank page and he took his glass and he went into his room and though he could have done many things, he chose instead to close his eyes and to lay his head on his pillow.

He might have wanted so much to speak, but he had neither the practice nor the intention and so he kept the momentum he had always known; feeling as if something was about to snap or collapse and instead of getting out of harm's way, learning to appreciate and to live with this new unsettling feeling.

Then he went to sleep.

# THE GREAT GIG IN THE SKY

He was dreaming.

But his little paws were so very sore.

He felt like he had been walking for months and as he shuffled forwards, he caught his reflection in a small puddle of water that was being fed by a leak in a rusted pipe that ran above his head, along the length of the tunnel's roof.

He saw in his reflection, an old rabbit, like he, gazing through the murky water with the same tired expression. The older rabbit looked worn as if Time and age were clinging onto his skin, anchoring him to his past and frightening him into running so that when he stopped and assumed he could run no more, his skin hanged loose and little sheets and kinks rolled into round and simple folds.

And it was hard to tell if he had stopped for good or whether he was just catching his breath before he tried one last time, to get somewhere.

The old rabbit's eyes were less than red; they were more of an orangey brown haze as if his spirit were now setting into the line of his imaginings and darkness were casting its shadow over his horizon.

He had a single breath in his mouth of which he swished around like a piece of hard candy, passing it through his teeth and under his tongue and though a child might have crushed the air with their chafing appetite and scoffed one or two more without even an inkling of consideration, the old rabbit kept that single breath in his mouth and held onto it like life had done unto him.

And when he finally exhaled, that last breath limped and hobbled out of his mouth and it settled just shy of his trembling chin. And though the old rabbit was terribly old, Theodore knew that the reflection was his own.

He had; since he was a child, felt this constant familiar strangeness to his own aging, as if a grain of sand were being compared to an Earth in its reflection. And in time, when he would accept that he was no longer that tiny seed and imagine himself revolving infinitely around his own imagination, he would then see in his reflection that his oceans were not as full as they had once been and what was once lush and green was now arid and crackling under the effect of Time.

And he had always felt; whenever he glimpsed at the pulling hands of Time in his own reflection, that he had been so small and insignificant when in fact he was momentous and telling and then that he was so handsome and relished, revered and adored when in fact every smile was a sneer of revolt and then that he had become learned and sagacious when in fact, he still knew so very little about himself and those who loved him and hurt him the most and then; in the end, that he was finally ready to run, when in fact, it was already too late.

And so, a young rabbit stared into his reflection and saw an old rabbit looking back.

"Where did the time go" he wondered. "And how did we ever lose track? Is this the same rabbit that amounts to wondrous things? And how long did we spend dreaming? Is this reflection really as it seems? Who are you old rabbit? I've seen you in times before. Is this; the face that greets me, the mask I always wore?"

He turned away from the puddle and saw a winding tunnel; ahead by the end of the room. It was a small hole dug into the join where the wall and floor met and the hole travelled in a different direction. Theodore squeezed his body through and clawed his way down deep into the darkness.

And he wasn't sure in what direction he was now going for it felt that he was digging up and then around then he felt his blood rushing to his head and then he felt that even though he was lying flat that he was, in fact, standing still.

And then he saw; just out in the distance, a shift in the colour and he rushed towards it with sprint in his paws as if Time had slipped of its grasp and lent him a second away from his own skin and he rushed and he raced, seeing the black and white shape always just another bound from his reach and then; when he came to some kind of an end, he looked behind him and though he could not see her, he could feel the threads of Time catching up with him, ready to weave him back into her fabric and he could feel his death being drawn into his shadow, a shadow he cast though there was no light about to do so.

He looked at his sore paws.

His nails were worn down to rounded stumps and the thick skin on his pads was cracked and bleeding but he had no choice. He dug his paws into the thick grey rock and tore away grain after grain and while his paws scurried away, he looked over his shoulder, feeling the footprints of Time creeping upon him and he turned his face back to the grey rock and he ripped away at loose stones and thick grey mud and he flung it all back over his shoulder and as he did, he turned his head and saw The Badger walking behind him through the darkness with something being carried like an infant in its quarrelsome hands and his paws they kept digging, but with every step of The Badger, they slowed and they slowed until they no longer dug, but instead they braced fearfully against the grey rock.

The Badger stood before him and its size was immense and its eyes were as hollow as its intentions and the thing in its arms was his self, the old rabbit of whom he had shared a stilling glance. And the rabbit looked weak and failing, his hazy eyes having turned a midnight black and he sat like a young child in the arms of The Badger and he spoke.

"I am not frightened of dying, any time will do. I don't mind."

Theodore felt every beat of his heart sink to the tips of his toes.

The old rabbit looked up to The Badger like a child would to his father.

"Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."

And the old rabbit stared into The Badger's hollow eyes following his own exclamation. He waited for any response that would concur with what he had said, but The Badger said nothing and The Badger did nothing.

The old rabbit then looked at Theodore and he didn't seem so sure anymore. He looked scared and so Theodore turned back to the rock and he dug and he dug and he dared not look over his shoulder. If Time were to make her mockery then she could do so without his avid attention and if he could, he would not swish that last breath around his stinging gums.

The air was thick and his spirit was fading.

And then Time spoke.

"If you can hear this whispering, you are dying," she said.

And then Theodore woke on his bed in a fevered sweat.

# MONEY

It looked like lightning was striking from outside his bedroom. Bright flashing streaks of white and yellow stormed through the hallway and between the small cracks where his door lightly banged back and forth, unable to close.

Theodore wiped the sweat from his brow and sat on the edge of his bed, concentrating on nothing but his breath. He put on his favourite slippers, the ones with oversized feet and he placed thin strips of potato peel on the inner soul and then dressed in a yellow robe and a pair of thick green woolen gloves.

The television was still on.

He must have fallen asleep and forgotten to turn it off. He didn't usually do things like that. He was always so conscious about waste; taking extra minutes each night to unplug every device and to double and triple check that noting was left running. Sometimes, though; as he lay in bed, he would always think he had left the kettle boiling or a bolt unlatched.

His mind felt as clouded and stuffy as the air in his apartment so he decided to get some air on his veranda. He turned off the television and took some change that was sitting on the counter and stuffed it into the pocket of his yellow robe and as he was walking out the door, he noticed a letter sitting unopened by the entrance.

"That's strange," he thought.

The post always came in the afternoon and he hadn't remembered seeing the letter when he arrived home. Surely he would have noticed something like that.

Then again, maybe he didn't.

He took the letter and put it with the loose change in his robe and closed the door behind him. As he walked down the path towards the taxi stand, he saw a group of adolescents huddled together obviously up to no good. One of them was dragging on a cigarette and he stopped in front of her, watching in an admiring daze as the end of the cigarette burned bright orange as she inhaled and only a slight trail of smoke slithered from the ends into the damp tunnel air and as he watched the smoke dissipate, he had a feeling that he had forgotten something and he felt a sudden urge like itch in the back of his mind to quickly rush home and double and triple check everything before he went anywhere.

"Did I lock the door?" he said.

"I don't know, did you," said the Smoking Girl.

"Sorry?" said Theodore looking confused.

"Are you ok man? You look kinda funny" she said.

"What would you do?" asked Theodore.

"What do you mean?" The Smoking Girl said.

"If you were me, and you weren't doing this. What would you do?"

"You're strange. I dunno. Maybe go to Syd's."

"Syd's. What is that? A bar?"

"It's a club. Really trendy. Everyone goes there."

"Are you going?"

"I dunno. Her guys, we goin to Syd's or what?"

The other rabbits shrugged their shoulders and continued passing around a small joint, their long fringes covering their jaded stares.

"I dunno," she said.

"Do you have another one of those?" asked Theodore, pointing to the cigarette in her hand.

"Sure, you got any money? I only got a couple and I got no more to get more."

"Money. Ok, yeah, no problems."

Theodore reached into the pocket of his yellow robe and took out the loose change he had taken from the counter and pressed all of it in The Smoking Girl's open paw.

"Woah mister, are you sure? For one smoke? Are you high? You're not a cop are ya?"

"I'd really like to try one."

"Sure. But just so you know. It's a fair deal. You can't ask for the money back."

"What money?" asked Theodore.

"Oh man, you are out there. Guys" she said, calling her friend's attention, "you gotta meet this guy here, he's really cool, like out there kinda cool."

The other rabbits continued to stare idly and unaffected through their long fringes. The Smoking Girl took a cigarette from her packet and handed it to Theodore and took the three hundred dollars he gave her and pressed it between her bosoms.

"I've never had one before. What do I do?" Theodore asked.

"You just light it, man. Hey, what's with the clothes? You goin to some fancy dress party" she asked.

Theodore looked down at his little fluffy toes popping through his slippers and wriggling away.

"I should have worn socks," he said.

"No that's cool man. Real trippy but cool man. Hey, do you wanna party with us?"

"Ok," said Theodore.

"You got any money though cause I don't have any and we'll have to get more smokes?"

Theodore checked his pocket, but it was empty except for an envelope. He could have sworn that he had picked up some loose change before leaving, but maybe he didn't.

Probably he didn't.

"Just this," he said handing over the envelope.

The Smoking Girl opened it swiftly with her cunning claw and smiled when she saw the gold card inside. She took it out and held it to the dim tunnel light to see if it was real or not, turning it over and over, flipping the card round and round and then pressing it firmly against her chest and smiling at Theodore.

"I love money," she said.

"Is that money?" asked Theodore.

"The next best thing," she said.

"So can we do something?" he asked.

"With this," she said holding the card before her eyes, "we can do everything."

Theodore fumbled with the lighter in his paws, unable to work with the child safety lock. His little gloved pads kept sliding off of the metal and the bright spark from the scratching flint was blinding him so that he could see three of everything and everyone and he didn't know which one to concentrate on to not show that he was either losing his mind or blatantly blind.

He chose the middle light and the middle girl.

"Can you help me?" he asked,

The Smoking Girl took the lighter from his hands and struck the flint below his trembling lip.

"Keep still," she said, referring to the cigarette that was bouncing up and down.

"It's my first time," he said. "Am I doing it right?"

"Inhale," she said. "Like when you breathe. Just inhale really strong."

"Like this?"

Theodore inhaled and the end of the cigarette glowed a terrific orange and a thick cloud of toxic smoke flooded into his mouth and with his breath down into his lungs and when he coughed, the cigarette flew from his mouth into a puddle on the ground and was followed by a round of perforated coughing and wheezing.

"Are you ok? You've never really smoked before?"

"No," he said between many brief gasps.

"Hey, there's a first time for everything. So... You wanna party?" she asked.

Theodore reached into his pockets and they were empty. He wondered then where he had left his keys and did he leave them at home or did he lose them somewhere on the way or did he leave them in the door? It wouldn't matter if he didn't lock the door if he left the keys just hanging there.

"I dunno," he said.

But it was too late. He was already inside the taxi and they were already speeding through the tunnels. He was seated in the back between four large adolescent rabbits. Neither of them spoke to one another. They all looked cynically unimpressed with what was happening and stared idly out through their long fringes, their wobbling heads swaying every time the taxi wove in and out of traffic.

"Stop up there by the mall," said The Smoking Girl, she, sitting in the front seat.

The Smoking Girl turned and smiled at Theodore. She had an infectious manic grin and her eyes were so wide, the whites lit up the dark ambience of the dirty old taxi. She looked as if she might jump out of her skin at any moment and jump into his.

Theodore looked down at his robe and noticed a loose thread near his knee. He pulled on the thread trying to swiftly snap it away from the robe, but it didn't work. Instead, the thread pulled longer than it was before and now it was definitely visible. Someone was bound to notice and say something.

He had to think quick.

He looked to the adolescents beside him but luckily they hadn't noticed anything, at least not yet. They were magnetized by some fraught thought in their minds; something deep and depressing that was keeping their attention stagnated. The Smoking Girl, on the other hand, was looking right at him, directly in his eyes and he thought to himself, "If she sees this thread, my night will be over."

"What thread?" she asked.

Theodore put his paw over his mouth and felt his lips.

"They move," he thought, "when I speak."

"Of course they do. They're lips. Look mine move too" she said, not really mocking him as much as she was enjoying the way in which he was.

Theodore smiled.

A stupid smile.

A wide distracting smile.

While he held that makeshift grin, The Smoking Girl's own widened and her eyes tuned unto his and there was no way in hell that she could see his paws, below their sight, busy twisting and turning the tiny bit of thread around his claw, over and over and over and extending his awkward but intoxicating smile every time he tried to yank the thread free of the fabric but every time he pulled his paw away, The Smoking Girl make some interesting flirting faces and he retracted his claws in giddy delight and the thread only pulled longer and longer and longer until there was no way he could keep a secret of this anymore.

"That'll be fifty bucks," said the taxi driver.

They had pulled over by an entrance to a shopping mall.

"Do you take plastic?" asked The Smoking Girl.

"You have plastic? I don't believe you" the taxi driver said.

The Smoking Girl pulled out the gold card and handed it to the driver.

"Yes mam," he said.

"Put fifty on there for yourself," she said.

"Thank you," he said.

"Tell you what. You wait for us here and take us to a club after and I'll pay you another four hundred. Whatta you say? Wait, how much for the whole night? To rent your taxi for as long as we want?"

"Depends. Nobody has ever done that before."

"Two thousand. I'll pay you five hundred now and five hundred after every stop" she said.

The driver was shocked.

"Deal," he said.

"Don't you try to pull one over on us or nothing either. My friend here in the yellow robe is crazy, just got out of the mental hospital. He'll find out where you live and make soup out of everyone you know."

The driver looked in his rear view mirror at Theodore whose eyes were glared as he fought to still secretly sever the now obvious hanging thread from the yellow robe.

"You can trust me. You don't need to worry about me, that's for sure. I'll wait right here for. Look I'll turn off my sign" the driver said, doing just that.

The Smoking Girl looked at Theodore and winked.

The adolescent rabbits exited the cab and entered the mall, still looking idly through their long fringes. The Smoking Girl exited after swiping the card with a feverish look in her eyes, pulling excitedly on the paw of Theodore who had a look of forfeiture in his own.

"Oh my god," she said, "I have dreamed about this for so long."

"Excuse me, madam," said a security guard, "you're kind is not welcome here."

"And what kind is that?"

"Poor. Now push off" he said.

The security guard was massive. He blocked the entire entrance and he was standing in front of the four adolescent rabbits, standing with one hand on his hip and the other with his gigantic palm pressing forward.

"Relax. We're with him" she said, wrapping her arms around Theodore.

The security guard looked at him strangely. He was dressed in nothing but a yellow bath robe, a pair of strange looking slippers and a pair of green woolen gloves.

"Are you Syd?" asked Theodore to the security guard.

"Who's Syd? No, I'm not Syd. You can call me sir" he said.

"I thought this was Syd's," said Theodore.

The Smoking Girl put her arm around his shoulder and walked him to the security guard whose nose was puffing and his eyes were glowing red with rage and authority.

"Let us through or we'll have you fired," she said.

The security guard scoffed.

"If you don't move in ten seconds I will crush your long haired friends and eat the one in the robe. Now move!" he shouted.

The Smoking Girl took the gold card from her pocket and held it beside her cheeky smile. The Security Guard dropped his defense, bowed gratefully and welcomed the six of them into the shopping mall.

"How much do you earn?" she asked.

"Three fifty a shift."

"What's a shift? Four hours?"

"Eighteen hours," said The Security Guard.

"I'll pay you eight grand to carry my bags," she said.

"What? You're joking, right? Is she joking?"

The Security Guard looked to the adolescent rabbits, but they just shrugged their shoulders and continued to stare idly through their long fringes. He then looked at Theodore who had the most focused and determined look on his face, as if he were solving some quantum riddle and then he looked back at The Smoking Girl, who was now smoking inside of the mall and grinning hysterically.

"What do you say?" she asked with a salty wink.

"Eight grand?"

"Ok, nine grand."

"Nine thousand dollars?"

"Ok, ten, but you gotta punch someone for me."

"Wait a second. Ten grand and I carry some bags and punch someone? Punch who?"

"I dunno yet. We'll see."

"Deal."

"One thing. Do you know who this is?" she asked pointing to Theodore.

"No," said The Security Guard.

"This is," she said, pausing as he turned over the card. "Theodore."

"Ok, hello Theodore."

"No, you don't get it. Theodore is royalty. He's like a prince or a son of a prince or something. So if you try to pull a swifty or anything and this gets back to the king, you'll be soup. Do you understand?"

"Sure. Hey, I'm legit, you can trust me. Prince Theodore. I haven't heard..."

"Of course you haven't. The real princes don't gloat about on the magazines. Do you think the heir to the throne is gonna advertise himself, in the middle of a depression? Theodore is next in line to be king."

The Security Guard looked at Theodore who still had his eyes locked somewhere in the distance trying intently to remain inconspicuous whilst attempting to sever the long thread from his yellow robe.

"What he doing?" whispered The Security Guard to The Smoking Girl.

"Stop looking! Don't be rude. You're not to look at Prince Theodore. In fact no one is. That's also your job" she said.

"Sure thing. I'm sorry" said The Security Guard, fighting the urge to see what Theodore had so fixated in his twisting and turning gloved palms.

"Prince Theodore wants new shoes. Where can we buy the most expensive shoes?"

"This way" said The Security Guard now guiding them through the shopping mall, ushering seemingly less rich patrons out of their way and the five oddly dressed adolescents with the one bizarre looking adult rabbit, caught a wake of oohs and ahhs as they parted the partying crowds and moved into one of many stops on their spree; this time for shoes, for Theodore.

The Smoking Girl sat Theodore down on a small stool and a pretty rabbit came hopping over with surprised pleasantry glowing in her red eyes.

"What will it be today?" The Attendant asked.

"Shoes. Theodore needs shoes. Pretty shoes. The most expensive shoes that you have."

"Oh my," said The Attendant.

She blushed somewhat looking at the obviously rich and admirable clients and at the rabbit in his yellow bath robe and her initial instinct was to rush away, to find herself a linen department and buy her own, one just like what he was wearing; exactly the same. And all the other female rabbits in the store, they all looked on with zealous want and desire and they were all thinking the same thing; catching their reflections in the wall of mirrors ad imagining themselves laced in a sunflower yellow bathrobe, with knee high boots or strapped stilettos and they all wondered if there was still time; to catch the fashion before it was gone, before it was too late.

"These are our most expensive pair of shoes. Diamond encrusted with golden trimmings. There's only one pair in existence. But can I ask, do you..."

The Smoking Girl held up the gold card.

The Attendant smiled generously; a white tooth for every thousand they were about to spend.

"Would sir like to try them on?"

"Of course," said The Smoking Girl.

Theodore didn't argue. His focus was on cutting that thread and without garnering any attention to what he was doing; playing uber cool and discreet.

The Attendant leaned down before his yellow robe and Theodore watched her strangely, keeping his two gloved paws pressing and hiding over the now increasingly long fugitive yellow thread. The Attendant ignored his eccentricity and pulled one of the slippers off his feet.

When she did, a potato peel fell to the floor and she turned her nose away to excuse the pong that rushed upwards with the fresh breeze in the mall.

"My apologies," she said. "I didn't mean any offence it's just..."

"It's ok, just fit the shoe."

"Is that a potato?"

Everyone looked down on the ground and then back at Theodore who was clasping the length of yellow thread in his palms, feeling that at any second, his secret would come undone, just like that thread.

"The other one," said The Smoking Girl sternly.

The Attendant pulled off the other slipper and again a thinly sliced potato peel fell from the bottom of his foot onto the floor and again, everyone from the store attendants, to The Security Guard, to the adolescent rabbits to The Smoking Girl herself, all looked at Theodore sitting in a yellow bath robe, with green woolen gloves on his hands.

"It's good for a fever," he said.

"You have a fever?" asked The Smoking Girl.

"I have a fever," he said.

"I thought you were on drugs," she said. "Do you like the shoes?"

"I don't know. Do I?" he asked.

"You do," she said.

"I guess I do. Are you Syd?" he asked.

"No, I'm not," she said. "Syd's is a club. We're going there now. We just have a few things to pick up first."

The Smoking Girl put her palm against Theodore's head. He was beyond burning up. It felt like his head was molten lava. They finalized the purchase and The Smoking Girl gave The Attendant a tip.

"How much do you earn in a month?" she asked. "Wait, don't tell me," she said, "whatever the value is, whatever you earn in a month, triple it and that's your tip."

"Are you sure?"

"Just do one thing for me."

"What?"

"Look in that mirror."

"Ok"

"Now tell yourself that you're an ugly whore."

"What?"

"Look in the mirror and say; I am an ugly stinking whore."

The Attendant did just that. She stared at her own reflection and cast the insult out into her own eyes.

"Now spit," said The Smoking Girl.

"What?"

"Spit on yourself. Spit on your reflection and call yourself an ugly poor whore."

The Attendant didn't think twice. Her eyes glared and glowed as rage boiled in her blood and she cast out the verse not once, not twice but a hundred times and she spat all over her reflection and then when she was done, she wept.

The Smoking Girl smiled and ran through fifty thousand dollars. Half for the shoes and half for the broken attendant collapsed under the weight of her own fraudulent self-esteem.

The rest of the spree worked out much the same with Theodore stumbling oddly from space to space, not quite sure if he was, in fact, alive or in a dream, feeling like his hands were two great balloons. The adolescent rabbits followed like trained and bored shadows, staring idly through their long fringes and saying very little, having now passed a spell of doldrums to a state of feigned cynicism.

The Smoking Girl stalked from store to store and she bought and she filled her bags which were carried by the massive Security Guard and she offered exorbitant tips and rewards but she asked so many torrid and wrong things in its favour and there was no wrong that wouldn't be done, not for another penny and in the end, when the bags were neatly packed inside the taxi, she asked The Security Guard to punch himself to which he did and he followed the instruction and he did it with zealous and he did it with zest and he fell over onto the ground beside the taxi and he never opened his eyes again.

"What was that about?" asked The Driver.

"Money," said The Smoking Girl. "Drive," she said.

Theodore sat in the back seat picking at the long yellow thread with a green gloved paw and the fur on his face was dampened from the swat that gushed from his forehead and by his brow.

"This is not how I am," he said, comfortably numb; but nobody was listening.

The adolescent rabbits continued to stare idly out from their long fringes and they seemed disconnected from their gangly bodies and the moon in which they found themselves.

The Smoking Girl, on the other hand, was in the front seat courting with disaster. Her desire to spend had her now shouting at The Driver and egging to flirt with her insanity. She screamed faster and he did just that. She yelled swerve and he did just that. She yelled hit him and The Driver did not stop. And she yelled faster and faster he went and with every command and she swiped her card across his machine and her face was orgiastic and her eyes were electric and she writhed in her chair without caution and without control and she screamed for more and more he gave her more and with every command she swiped the card; hundreds and thousands and then hundreds of thousands, so much money it could never be counted and never be spent and with every swipe, her body felt like it could explode and she gripped the handles by the door; panting and sweating.

"More" she screamed.

And more The Driver gave, pushing his little paw down on the accelerator so that the engine roared as the taxi swerved through traffic and The Smoking Girl screamed stop but The Driver couldn't hear, for he has turned his black and white badger head and was looking at the long yellow thread in Theodore's green gloved paws and said.

"Why does anyone do anything?"

And Theodore opened his palm and dropped the yellow thread and it was so long that ran down past his legs and curled up onto the floor and that was where he found himself, sweating and delirious, by the foot of his bed.

# US AND THEM

The phone was ringing and his alarm was alarming, but both whispered into his ear so gently that it felt like the warning sounds were massaging his concern and inviting him to rest a little longer.

"Hi this is Theodore, I can't come to the phone right now but if you'd like to leave a message after the beep, I'll be sure to call you right back. Thanks ever so much."

"Theodore it's me. I've got great news. I'm coming right over. Are you there? Hunny bunny? Listen I don't wanna spoil the surprise so, I'll see you soon, ok?"

"Message erased."

Theodore stood with his finger on the delete button and he was almost afraid to pull it off. For the moment, everything was a clear canvas; unspoiled and unsplintered.

His fever had resided, but his head felt like someone had filled it with hot sand. He looked around at the mess on the floor where clothes and old magazines were strewn about. It didn't make sense to try and clean it now, maybe later when he had more zest.

He poured himself a coffee and buttered some stale toast and he stared out his window while the lights in the tunnel went from a dim hazy yellow to the bright luminescent of a new dawn. The television was still playing from the night before and the screen flickered off out of his sight, images of engineers and politicians shaking hands by a red ribbon with a crowd of rabbits shouting in a thousand tongues as the ribbon was being strung up. Some of them celebrated and praised and some of them cursed and protested and it was so hard to tell who was who and if at all they had something to say.

It was still very early, but he decided to leave for work before Florence arrived. He just couldn't deal with her voice, not today. So he packed some carrots into a small brown bag and he made his way to the train station and on his way he passed through some of the unswept debris of the night.

"Hey buddy," said an addled rabbit, lazing about on the ground with its mouths agape and its eyes gelled shut. "Hey, hey buddy, hey. Hey, buddy hey."

The addled rabbit didn't say much more than this. He stumbled through a poorly conceived introduction and just repeated himself over and over and then over again and he shouted loud and abrasive as Theodore stepped over his disheveled bed and made his way down through the luminary tunnel.

"Hey," he shouted. "Hey buddy, hey."

Theodore could see up ahead; The Sweepers, coming through with their brooms and truncheons and tazers and vociferating despotic accents, swinging and prodding their arms, flexing their disciplinary tongues and ushering; without much argument, the homeless and the wrecked debris of the night into shooing and to scattering and to moving along the dawning tunnel, away from the doorsteps of the good citizens and back into the minute begging shadows where they belonged.

Theodore watched silently and without much opinion. There was no room for him to pass so he backed against a neighbouring door and held his briefcase as The Sweepers made their way down the street, singing jovially whilst beating small defenseless rabbits with long barbed truncheons.

"Such armoury" Theodore thought, "for such little fight."

The homeless and the addled banded together not in retaliation but in desperate flight. They scampered over one another and hopped away in disarray. There were a few though who turned and helped the smaller and more fragile rabbits from their stupors, but it was always too late.

By the time they managed to rouse the small and the elderly, The Sweepers were already upon them, beating down with their gloved fists and prodding with their stabbing and electrifying tools and if they hadn't gotten up by now, they were swept into the gutters where they would be washed away somewhere where nobody ever really thought about, somewhere not terribly important.

"Please," said one of the younger rabbits.

Her eyes were tuned unto Theodore's and there was no adjective that he could use to describe how they seemed and in finding himself trapped in her stare, how he felt. He said nothing himself and just watched helplessly as several uniformed men picked her up by her broken back paw and tossed her around, laughing amongst themselves as her body fell onto the ground like a deflated football.

"Please," she said again.

Theodore reached his paws into his pockets.

"Good morning sir," said one of The Sweepers smiling and nodding to Theodore.

Theodore nodded back.

It was the polite thing to do.

Before she could mouth another word, the small rabbit was truncheoned and swept into the gutter and in just a second, The Sweepers passed and where the small pleading rabbit had been was now clean.

Still pressed against his neighbour's door, Theodore watched as The Sweepers casually made their way down the dawning tunnel, some singing like drunken sailors, others whistling and humming Grieg's Morning Mood and it was so loud that you couldn't at all hear the sound of rabbit's feet breaking and their quiet little pleas as their bodies were swept away into gutters that flushed them like old newspaper or dried leaves, in a river that ran under the tunnel road to somewhere not very important.

Theodore always liked waking to the sound of Morning Mood and he had always wondered where it came from. It always sounded so jovial and raucous and it was such a wonderful way to retreat from slumber and open one's eyes.

And now he knew.

When he arrived at the train, he was almost the first rabbit.

"How strange," he thought.

The Pretty Rabbit was there, standing in front of him with her little paws and her unpainted sandaled feet standing just at the tip of the yellow cautionary line and her tiny toes wriggled like wriggly worms as they played the cold morning air like a piano.

Theodore was so nervous.

"Hello," she said.

"Hello," he said, in his head.

The Pretty Rabbit stared at Theodore funny and then turned away; looking back down the tunnel uncomfortably and Theodore joined her, hoping to himself that the sound of the rattling train might quieten the awkwardness in the back of his mind.

"I just love Morning Mood," she said.

"Me too," said Theodore, thinking to himself, "what a stupid rabbit thing to say."

He squinted his eyes and scrunched his fists.

"Where do you think they go?" asked The Pretty Rabbit.

She was still staring down the tunnel and she was leaning forwards so that the slightest breeze might knock her forwards off onto the tracks and by the look of her, she didn't at all seem to care and it puzzled Theodore so much that it played on attraction.

"I like to wake up early and catch the first train. I don't like the rush and all the rabbits. I don't really like all the sex either" she said, still looking down the tunnel and now reaching out over the edge of the platform on the tips of her scruffy and dirtied toes.

She was the opposite of every girl he had ever known. Florence would have stayed promptly behind the yellow line and her toes would be patient on the soles of her well-presented shoes and she would never look away from someone as she was speaking to them.

"It just seems like you have to do it. It's all very boring" she said.

Theodore couldn't have agreed more, and he didn't.

He said nothing.

"Are you rude or just nervous?"

His mouth opened to speak, but nothing came out. His tongue was dry and stuck to the roof of his mouth. He made a gurgling sound that was like a bath's drain swallowing air with the last gulps of soapy water.

"I see you every morning. You're with that prissy girl, the one with the coloured bobbins. What's her name?"

"Florence," said Theodore.

"Very prissy name. Are you in love?"

"I don't know."

"Then why are you with her?"

"I don't know. We dated once, ten years ago."

"And you're still together?"

"I guess so."

"Why are you still with her?"

"I don't like change all that much."

"That makes sense I guess."

Theodore too, assumed that it did, though what he felt was contrary, but without definition.

"Do you think it's fair?"

She turned away from the tunnel and turned to him.

She was so simple.

She was so plain.

And yet she was so beautiful.

"What do you think?" he asked.

"I don't think," she said. "I feel."

"You feel? What do mean? You make decisions on how you feel? What does that feel like? How do you know what you feel?"

"It doesn't need a name to be real or affecting and it doesn't need a definition to be acted upon and it definitely doesn't need an explanation when it's been done. You should try it. You might lose your fear of change."

Looking into her eyes, Theodore felt an urge to kiss her.

"What do you feel like doing?" she asked.

He wanted to take her in his arms.

He wanted to feel her beating heart against his nervous chest.

He wanted to kiss her and to hold her forever.

"Run," he said.

"What?" she said giggling.

"Run. I mean, I feel like running."

"Where to?"

"Away."

"That sounds delightful."

"Do you have dreams?" he asked.

"I dream all the time," she said.

"The other rabbits; my friends, Florence, they don't dream, none of them dream. I saw The Guru yesterday."

"Oh and how was that?"

"He told me all I needed to do was to breathe and then everything would be ok."

"Did you? Is it?"

"No. It's not ok."

"You speak a lot, with your eyes. Did you know?"

"No. Do I?"

"You said hello to me every morning and you asked me to save you. But your legs, they carried you like your tongue, away from what your heart truly wanted."

Theodore blushed.

"Do you think there is a sun?" she asked.

"I think there has to be, at least something. It can't all be dark. Something has to be casting this shadow."

"You know what I really hate?"

"What?"

"Coming to an end of a good book. I don't like it when things end and I can't stop myself rom rushing through."

"I think I might quit my job today," said Theodore.

"What do you do?"

"I burrow."

"Do you like burrowing?"

"It's not what I'd like to do."

"What would you like to do then?"

"I don't know really. I don't know anything outside of what I do, but I have this feeling that there might be something else, something more fulfilling. It's like an itch in my stomach and in the back of my mind."

"So scratch it."

"I'm afraid."

"Of what?"

"That the itch isn't really there. That's it's just my head playing tricks on me."

Theodore could see; in the corner of the tunnel, peering through the darkness, a black and white face and its eyes were sneering and its licking tongue was basting its cutting teeth.

"I'm afraid it's not real. That it's all in my head. That I'm going mad. Do you ever feel like this?"

"We're all mad. It's just some are better at playing their role."

"What do you do?" he asked.

"Shhh," she said. "This is the best part."

A rumble roared through the tunnel and the air was filled with a bee-like buzz as morning burst through the thousands of bulbs above their heads and light burst through the tunnel and blinded both of the rabbits.

"My eyes" yelled Theodore.

"Keep them open" yelled The Pretty Rabbit.

Theodore did as she said, looking up into the buzzing light.

"Ok now shut them," she said.

He closed his eyes and when he did he saw bright flashing worlds cascading around his closed eyes and they were all different sizes and one of them was so bright. Theodore imagined that it was the sun and he reached out with his paws trying to grasp it between his claws but he cut straight through it every time and it stayed, blinding his sight but invisible to his touch and when he opened them again, the doors of the dawn train had just closed and The Pretty Rabbit was sitting by herself and scratched into the window; just by her face, was the word 'breathe'.

No sooner had the train parted then another arrived and Theodore jumped aboard quickly finding himself a seat and staring transiently out of the window, seeing for the first time, the small holes that had been made on the far end of the tracks where the homeless rabbits probably scurried and made their absence during the day.

"Is anyone sitting here?"

Theodore looked to his left and there was a large rabbit hovering above the seat beside him. The rest of the train was empty. It was just the two of them. He looked at the other seats and then back at the large rabbit and tried not to wince as he smiled.

"No," he said. "That's fine."

The large rabbit sat down and his arm pushed into Theodore's ribs and he was reading a newspaper and insisted on shaking it thoroughly as he unfolded it and cleared his sickly throat and ground his teeth as he skimmed his way through every headline, shaking out the nonsense rigorously with every turn of the page and it all seemed so important and grown up like.

When the train stopped, Theodore exited onto the ramp and he looked quickly to all sides on the will of chance that he may see The Pretty Rabbit again and if he did, he would tell her what he felt and he would kiss her and he would make up for every mistake he had ever made.

She wasn't there.

Instead, as he walked along the brightly lit morning tunnel, he passed a crowd of rabbits standing in a circle and some cheered and jeered while others looked on in such a state of shock that they couldn't turn away or lift their finger to stop whatever was happening.

Theodore approached the circle and peered over a rabbit's shoulder. Therein the middle were two rabbits, striking and biting and slashing and gashing one another; their paws thrusting forwards and their large sharpened claws digging and cutting into one another's flesh.

There was so much blood.

"What's happening?" asked Theodore.

"The bum started it He was asking for money. Other guy lost it and just started punching him then the bum got in on it, got some good punches in and well it's been like this for a good ten minutes or so."

"Was he in the right?"

"Who, the bum?"

"No, the other one."

"Yes, absolutely in the right."

"Which is which?" asked Theodore.

"What?" said the rabbit confused.

"Who is who?" he asked again.

The rabbit looked at the two feuding rabbits in the centre of the circle and both of them were bleeding horrendously and both were beaten black and blue. The rabbit looked back at Theodore with a blank expression.

"I don't know," he said.

Theodore left the pack and continued walking along the tunnel, watching the cracks in the ground and ensuring his every step never touched a single one.

"I'll go in and quit, right now. Just march straight up to HR and quit, then and there" he said in his mind.

It was only a minute or so before he arrived at work and when he arrived, the main gate was slightly ajar. He pushed his way through and headed up the hallway towards administration. He passed several janitors who were almost slow dancing with their mops as they drudged along the floor.

Theodore thought about The Pretty Rabbit and how morose she looked, sitting aboard the train and "life," he thought, "shouldn't at all feel this way."

He stormed down the hall expecting to see that haughty HR analyst seated behind her desk drinking her steaming coffee and stretching her untethered paws as if her trial had at all been any kind of a burden. He grunted to himself as his fists clenched and a fiery rage built within his pent voice, waiting to explode at her stupid smiling face.

He reached her office.

It was locked.

A sign on the door said 'Use the other door'.

# ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE

In the afternoon, a hundred thousand rabbits stood side by side before a grand stage. The lights were stinging and in front of them, with a set of scissors in his paws was The King and beside him, a set of his generals and suited businessmen and two scientists in white overalls and a host of engineers aligned to the right.

Behind The King was a single small door.

And behind it, the other side of the moon.

And with it, the sun.

"My dear rabbits, of all kind; thinkers, growers, doers and burrowers I welcome you to a new dawn, to the future we have all been paving with our own collective paws. Behind me stands the greatest achievement in the history of the rabbit. For centuries we have lived in perpetual night, here on the dark side of the moon and for this great time, that darkness has weighed upon our thoughts but it has not heavied our hearts and it has not blanketed our vision for it had been said by my father's father that a time would come when rabbits would bring light unto the void and the sun, unto the dark side of the moon and my dear rabbits, I, King Rabbit III, take great pleasure in giving you, here today, in our present, my father's father's future. Today, we will no longer live under fluorescent light. Today, we shall harness and live under the sun."

The crowd erupted in cheer.

Theodore stood somewhere near the middle. He was being squashed on all sides by the larger rabbits all about him. And as the others raised their paws above their heads and clapped in unison, Theodore simply stood with his arms by his side thinking to himself that the air down here, amidst the celebration, was becoming warmer and thicker by the second and he felt his breath getting shorter.

"Now for the ribbon."

King Rabbit took the scissors and cut the red ribbon and the crowd erupted again and all through the kingdom, in the tunnels and at home in front of their televisions, rabbits cheered and hugged and waited anxiously for the small door behind their king to open and; for the first time in any of their lives, to see the sun.

"They key please," said King Rabbit.

He had his hand extended, but his servants all shrugged their shoulders and responded with blank expressions. They all turned to the royal guard who then turned to the scientists who then turned to the engineers, who were the ones who built the door.

Nobody had a key.

"My dear rabbits. This is a very embarrassing situation. As it turns out, someone has forgotten the key. Can we send for the key?" said King Rabbit looking at his servants.

They shook their heads.

"Ok then. The inauguration will be delayed until tomorrow. Thank you so much for coming, please respect one another on your way out and we thank you for being here for the ribbon cutting. Tomorrow, the grand festival of the opening of the door shall take place at dawn, where; we shall have for the first time, a real sun to wake up to."

The crowd cheered.

But not like they did before. This time in an empty contrary kind of way and it sounded more like the natural tone of their voices and so they hanged on for one more day, quiet in their discontent, celebrative of their desperation.

At home, Theodore picked through some clothes that were lying about on the floor. They had their first gig tonight and he wasn't sure how he felt about it. He wasn't nervous and he wasn't at all excited. Yet he wasn't bored and he wasn't indecisive.

"Can I tell you that thing?" asked Florence.

"Can it wait?" said Theodore.

"Of course, what am I thinking? You must be so nervous. I want this to be special anyway. What should I wear? I never know what to wear."

Florence was opening all of his drawers and his closets and she was tearing blouses and skirts and high heeled shoes and fish net stockings and littering his bed with lipstick and eye shadow and blush and brushes and combs.

Theodore watched her busily readying herself and he stared not at Florence, but at the arsenal in her hands and at her reach.

"They're not mine," he said.

"Of course not. I'd be worried if they were."

"But what are they doing here, in my house, in my room, in my drawers?"

"I put them here silly billy."

"Are you moving in?" he asked, looking fraught and pale.

"What colour do think; red or pink?"

He looked at her holding the two dresses.

"Any colour you like," he said.

# BRAIN DAMAGE

Everyone was backstage, seated in a circle and smiling and laughing. Someone lit a joint at one point and it passed through every paw except for Theodore's. He stood by the door with his arms folded looking at his friends reveling while, in the back of the room, a black and white Badger stood with its arms folded looking with combustible eyes and grinding teeth.

"Oh come and sit with us hunny bunny. Don't be so..."

"Flippin weird" yelled The Drummer.

The group all laughed hysterically.

"Mi amour is such a bore and his name is..."

"Theodore" shouted Florence, high on belonging.

Theodore would have ignored them had he believed that they were actually there, mocking him. He felt so out of orbit with everything and with himself and so he stared at the green carpet below the door and he thought of nothing; no sound, no picture and no feeling whatsoever.

None of this was real.

Florence, the band, work, the tunnel, the dark side of the moon, none of it was real. It was like The Badger, something he was living inside of a fever. Maybe he lay on a bed somewhere, fed through tubes and kept in a deep sleep and what he was living now was just an afebrile dream.

"If I can't see them, then I can't imagine them real," he thought.

But he could hear them laughing and he could imagine in his wayward eyes what they looked like, scampering over one another, giving high fives and improper smiles and it was so hard to erase their voices from his head.

But he tried.

He stared at the floor, imagining what it would have been like had he not met Florence, had he not taken her home and had he not remembered her name, the outline of her petite body, the sound of her brash laugh, the roundness of her eyes and the way they found you no matter where you tried to hide and the way she said his name.

He wished he could not remember any of it. He wished that when she said his name, he would turn, as if he thought it was someone else and when he caught her plated eyes, he would see it wasn't her and he would turn away; mollified and unfamiliar.

As so he stared at the floor, imagining none of the friends and lovers as his and a newspaper slid through the crack below the door and its front page was blank. Theodore leaned down and picked up the newspaper and flicked through every page and every page was a blank as the one before.

"Oh my god" shouted Florence. "Did you see that?"

"No," thought Theodore.

She ran over to him and pulled the newspaper from his hand and took it back to the circle seating herself in the centre and she held up the front page to Rex and the other band members and they were all in awe and shock and they all said things like "I can't believe it" and "I knew it all along" and they all looked so concerned and their merriment had soured.

"Can you believe it Theodore?" shouted Florence.

She held up the newspaper into the air above everyone's heads.

"Did you see this Theodore? Oh my god, what did you think? Is this the strangest thing you've ever seen?"

He looked over and saw Florence flouting over a blank page.

"You should sing about this," she said.

"Hey, great idea. We could write a song about this. Now. Let's do it" said Rex.

The band started strumming their guitars and tapping their wooden sticks against the ground and they all looked to Theodore to fill in the words and they stared with open eyes and wanting ears but his face was as blank as the paper, with no expression and no care and the others, they watched him in absolute wonder and Florence, she jumped to her feet and rushed to where he stood, draping herself over his body as he stood blank and disengaged and the other band members, they read him like a conductor and they played with an unforeseen zest and the song, it just came out them, from nowhere and Theodore, he stood there, silent and as blank as the front page.

"You're a genius," said Rex.

The others agreed.

They put down their instruments and cheered and the cheering was so loud it was like thunder clapping in his ears and when he turned around, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of rabbits all cheering and clapping and waving their cellular phones in the air and they shouted for more and more and Theodore, he looked to the side of the stage and he saw Florence looking at him adoringly, her right paw gently massaging her belly and then he looked at his band who were circled around him and they had their instruments in their hands and they strumming and beating away and he had no idea what they were playing and he looked back across the stage at Florence, and he had no idea who she was and then he looked out over at the cheering crowd and he had no idea how to make them stop. The less he did, the more fascinated they became.

"Encore, encore, encore" they shouted.

Theodore stood there, as blank as the front page.

And they cheered.

And they were ecstatic.

And the girls wanted to be his.

And the men wanted to be him.

And he stared, as blank as the front page.

And the crowd they shouted more.

And the band they shouted more.

And The Badger, he shouted more.

And Florence, she shouted, "I'm pregnant."

And Theodore left the stage.

# ECLIPSE

Everything he had and everything that he was and everything he would ever be was everything that everyone imagined him being.

Theodore walked for such a long time and he thought about all of the things that gravitated towards him and he felt insignificant in light of the part of himself that he couldn't see, that part that others found so fulfilling.

Florence was pregnant.

And he couldn't find the other door.

He wanted to quit.

Everything.

All of it.

Florence.

The pregnancy.

His apartment.

Her clothes

His drawers.

Shopping.

Overdrafts.

Burrowing.

Sore paws.

Rewards.

Promotion.

Use the other door.

His band.

Fame.

Work.

Mirrors.

His reflection.

Real.

Or not.

And use the other door.

Theodore stepped onto the stage and kicked aside the red ribbon that was still strewn about, now tumbled and curled over itself and it was amazing how a red ribbon, even when it has been discarded and left to the wind, can still look so special.

Theodore picked up the scrap of ribbon and if it had feelings, he could hold it close and shush its fright and concern and he would tell it, "I know how you feel."

With the red ribbon in his hand, Theodore approached the other door; the small wooden door at the back of the stage and he pressed his nervous paw on the handle and the handle turned.

The door was unlocked.

It opened.

He walked through to the other side.

And then he remembered where he left his keys.
