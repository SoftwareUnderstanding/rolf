Acknowledgments

We would like to thank God for instilling in us the gift of writing, which we utilize in the hopes of touching the lives of others. When one pens a mixture of words, emotions and life experiences, the resulting masterpiece serves to motivate, cultivate and encourage those who seek deliverance, love, or solace.

Author Charron Monaye and I have met some truly amazing poets, who we have come to admire, and we wanted to provide to them an open platform to share their beautiful poetry with the world.

As a result, The Poetic Lounge was born. This publication offers great poetry, written by twenty talented poets from varied walks of life.

It is our sincere hope that this volume will leave each reader smiling, crying, laughing, seeking greatness, but ultimately...craving more.

Note To The Reader

Introduction

The T.P.L Project" was an idea that CEO Fiordaliza Charles and Author Charron Monaye came up with when they noticed so many talented poets/writers networking that may have never been published. This concept gave them the platform needed to help showcase as many poets and writers worldwide.

"We are very fortunate to have come across so many talented and truly amazing poets and writers. We will like to thank all that contributed in the making of this project and to build a book of everlasting memories"

### I'VE COME TOO FAR TO GO BACK NOW

I think I was given another chance at life,

because,

see,

I was headed down the wrong path at 1 time,

but I know God has bought me from a mighty long way.....

I have a light in me that I want to shine,

another life in me that I must live,

one where my heart is always full of joy and happiness and my desires are met.

I got smiles I haven't even began to use, stored up inside of me and I've come too far to go back now,

too far to be easily discouraged,

too far to let anyone steal my joy ever again!

I've come this far by faith and with my faith,

I plan to soar higher and higher each day....

Shine on bright light, shine on!!!!!

I've come too far...

### PRAISE

All praise goes to one of God's most beautiful creations......the Black man!

I praise my brotha's for their determination,

their skills and the beauty of their skin.

I give you props for your struggle and your strengths.

I love the uniqueness of your style,

the swagger in your walk and the compassion in your heart.....

ooooooh! how I love the way you are.

how you love, protect and stand by what you love,

I love the way you love your mother, your children and handle your business

I love you for your failures as well as your accomplishments.

I give praise to one of God's most beautiful creations......the Black man

oh how I love thee

### IN LOVE WITH HIS GIFTS

When he opens his mouth I hear the voice of an angel,

singing lullabies to my soul.

Nothing worries me anymore once he opens his mouth and runs his beautiful fingers across those ivory keys,

he puts me in a musical trance and touches me deep with his gifts from God.

Sang that song daddy,

play them keys!

Sing what God has put into your heart so that you can touch the hearts of others...

### He sings the sweetest melodic melodies that keep me falling deeper in love with him.

### LAST NIGHT

Last night I cried my last tear

I dreamt my last dream

I throw away all the memories

Everything which connected me to you is gone

There is nothing left so your power can't be reproduced

I won't tolerate the disrespect

You can't make me bow down to your orders

There is no way I can conform to your demands

When you have no clue or idea, what it really means to be my man

I deserve better

I will not settle for anything less

You can say what you want

You can scream and yell all you please

But today was your last opportunity to say anything else to me

I have nothing else to give

Won't be wasting any more of my time

You don't appreciate me, never have

I can't give you what you don't want

So the buck stops now, I'm done with you

Out of my life is what you are about to you

Last night I erased my thought and memories that I carried

Just for you

### THE OTHER WAY

What doesn't kill you?

Will make you stronger

Is what some folks say

But what happens when I

Lose all consciousness

My memories escape me

The faults I have embraced won't move out my way

Will I continue to make the same mistakes?

Will life lessons preserve it to reveal the reality in the necessary heartbreaks?

Every hurt is required for pain

Just like every pain is necessary for the sun to shine

When I think of the time I lost my way

I only have myself to blame

The lessons were not learned and reality was not shown

I was too immature too see everything I really need

Was right in front of me

I was running to places that wasn't meant for me

So I created all this unnecessary misery

And even though I am a better person

Because of the extra journey that led me here today

I wish I was wise enough, mature enough, and determined enough

To do it

The other way.

### CROSSING THE LINE

### My heart wouldn't let me walk away

### Regardless of what you put me through

### I could hate you forever

### In my reality, what would that prove?

### Honestly, we was never meant to be

### You tolerated me

### Just like I dealt with you

### I know it wasn't right

### We let lust control

### Bring to life a situation

### A movie that shouldn't have been scripted

### Characters pretending to be who their not

### Even though

### We knew the game was a lie

### We kept playing until the battlefield became too much

### Allowing anger to cover who we are

### Falling victim to the stories our friends would shout

### Without correcting cause the pain of it all

### Hurt so much

### It was deadly ground we stood

### Knowing it wasn't the safest concept to live by

### We couldn't end what we started

### Cause everything about it felt so right

### The plug has been pulled

### The production has finally ended

### A story that should have never been scripted

### Depicted, reconstructed to show

### How we let a mistake evolve into reality

### Something we wasn't ready for

### Something that neither one of us could handle

### It was fun while it lasted

### I owe you no good byes

### We were a mistake that should've never happened

### But since we did

### You will remain the poster child to how

### Fairy tales end

### When you cross the line with a friend!

### THE CONVERSATION

### I've imagined the finer things in life

### I've dreamed for everything in my reach

### I've prayed for a powerful language to teach me how to speak

### I know the things I wish for wasn't too far out of my control

### So I stepped in God's shoes to get a quick peek

### I had to see if my dreams would become the plan I wanted to seek

### And quickly my God spoke to me, saying;

"No need to peek, you are too impatient and need to think

### If this dream is yours to keep

### Can you complete every mission requested of you

### Or when times get hard,

### Will you run away forgetting the trials you must go through?

### To make sure your loyal and committed to the desires you so dream

### Are you willing to do what needs to be done?

### No one wants a quitter on their winning team

### So your answers will be a revealed in due time

### But right now your time is depending on mine and with your behavior

### I think you will do just fine

### But before I release your first miracle, you must pass one more test

### It won't be easy, your future will be jeopardized if you fail so do your best

### Anything worth having, is worth fighting for

### So step back, watch the signs, because your first stop will that closed door

### Don't be discouraged

### Remember it's only a test to determine your passion to what you've ask

### Once you pass this test, blessings would shower in abundance

### That you would have no clue how to manage

### I will not see you on a journey to leave lost, abused, and led astray

### You are my child, and nobody will do my child that way

### So know I close by, and the only engine that is allowing your mission to operate

### You can thank me later, you deserve it, but for now I am the one who facilitates

### No help is needed from you.

### THE DIVORCE

The hardest thing

I had to face was separating from the womb that carried me

From yelling and screaming

To prove that your bitterness would not affect me

To see my children reaction when they saw mommy and daddy fighting

To watch my life flash before me

When I signed the last sheet of paper that permanently freed me

We were not ready to make such a commitment

Ending a life of fantasies while enjoying the moments we embraced

Never thinking of the pain it would cause our off-springs

The moment we decided this marriage could no longer win

Did our selfish acts lead us to another road of confusion?

Will it present those hurtful questions that we can never answer?

Or can you explain the harsh reality and tell your daughter, WHY

I know they say

It's better to be apart rather than show the kids an ugly situation

### Did we take into account before we had that horizontal conversation?

### We were not capable, or

### Did we allow the power of lust to overcome the reality?

### We had no business creating

### Either way, our immature actions will never gain the satisfaction

### From the lives we are now separating

### This divorce has destroyed the sacrament given to us to honor, protect and share

### But we ended it, without a second thought,

### Not focusing on who it would hurt or who really cared

### Whenever I hear mommy can I go over daddy house

### I am automatically reminded of the bitter end that separated our family

### Divorce, the plague that destroys millions of home each year

### Can be reduced if we, learn to love and go back to the days when love was live

### You made that vow and to it, you should behave in a manner

### Manifested in God's love to give chance and hope to a new family

### Born to see new life

### Divorce is a virus, which destroys, makes sure you are ready

### Know what you want, understand what you are getting into, cause

### Once you make that option your reality, it naturally affects everyone around you forever

DARWIN

GREAVES

DARWIN GREAVES was born in Barbados, West Indies.  
And now resides in Philadelphia, Pa. Poetry. Is his favorite word, he loves that word Poetry is, to him, a snapshot of life. He, through the muse, have laughed, cried and been inspired to reach beyond the limitations others set. He has been writing seriously for 7 years and by seriously he means truly giving to the muse what he has received. In this realm of poetry he has been touched and inspired by fellow artists. That, to him, is the reason why he does this. Not for accolades, though I appreciate and humbled by them. No for the connection with people through the vehicle of writing. Poetry is a snapshot of life. His life in words.

Future project soon to be released. The first in a series of poetry books "Manifestation of My Manhood" will be release May/Early June 2011.

AT YOUR REQUEST

### At Your request,  
I looked within,  
and found no knight in shining armor  
preparing to defend.  
Yes, my heart is free,  
to ride the ever changing winds,  
but it refuses to fly,  
for it lacks the discipline.  
To know when,  
enough is quite enough,  
before what I must...  
devolves into distrust.  
Ashes to ashes,  
and dust to dust,  
will my life end this way, tell me please.  
Who am I to demand,  
when all through my life,  
I've slapped away your hand,

### refused to accept  
your reprimands,  
and now I feel the ever changing winds.  
I can't withstand  
when I look within,  
when I look deep within.  
At your request,  
I closed my eyes,  
and in my dreams I saw myself  
wearing a bad disguise.  
The lofty plans I devised,  
all met a quick demise.  
And still, though you reached out to me  
I refused to compromise.

### There is no prize,

### at the end of an aimless path

### no exclamation at the end

### of my life's final paragraph.

### No celebrating the good man I was,  
no toasts during my repast.  
Not if I,  
refuse  
to defuse,  
the evil trapped inside of me.  
In your presence,  
I stand accused.  
And as I lay my final night to sleep,  
I pray my soul will keep,  
until a brighter day.  
I know you are the light,  
yet my eyes are closed.  
I'm always saying I'm indisposed,  
but in truth,  
my soul has decomposed.

But through it all I know,  
my soul can be reborn.  
For a man wearing a crown of thorns,  
gave his life so I could live,  
and when I pass away be respectfully mourned .  
Every day  
I have been warned,  
In every way.  
Your love I have scorned,  
please Father before   
someone notifies my next of kin,  
before my life comes to an end,

give me the strength.  
At your request, to look within  
To look within,  
To look within

### A PERSONAL NOTE

### A personal note to you my love,  
I know I've been inviting,  
the demon to dine,  
unrefined.  
Words at the altar of Isis,  
disinclined.

### To praise a covenant so priceless,  
the chime.  
Awakens the Christ,  
I climb  
upon the altar of ignorance and vice  
align  
my soul to be sold for a fair price  
a love divine  
strangled by strife,

### mangled and left without hope.  
A personal note to you my beloved  
I will always,  
I will always,  
Love the warmth of your smile.

### The clock  
ticking, matching the moans of the beguiled.  
The shock  
of being marooned on this sacred isle.  
Mocked  
by the bibliophile.  
Locked  
within the crucible of a lover's exile.  
Blocked  
by a blessing defiled.

### A flock

### of seagulls fly single file.  
Through the smoldering embers  
of a love once remembered.

### To be so true,  
and fanned by flames,  
the remains  
of a personal note  
to only you.  
To only you.

### Signed I will always love you

FALSE MOON

The crescent moon brings a tear to her eye  
the waning sun illuminating her false wishes  
as time passes by.  
The moon appears to she...  
waning as her lover's destiny,  
dramatic changes  
in the lunar phases,  
of her tortured heart.  
Moon cycles affect her sensitivity  
once captured in the throes of a romance  
albeit,  
a moment of brevity.  
What appeared to be  
a lover's moon

### has come to be  
a long,  
lasting kiss goodbye.  
The new moon brings a soothing calm,  
her parched and blistered heart  
needing the emotional balm.  
For so long  
she waited for a redemptive pause...  
relief from  
the effects of her righteous cause  
to save  
an embattled heart.  
The waning crescent bids a fond goodbye  
Moving across her false dawn  
In a foreboding sky.  
Unfortunately  
she,  
once danced with moon beams  
and now it seems  
'This the end of her reverie  
forever lost  
is she,  
in the  
memories,  
of a long  
lasting,  
kiss,  
goodbye.

### MELANCHOLY ROSE

### Tell me what you want my baby,

### show me what you need my lady

### forever,

### for you and I seems lately

### to be

### the tears falling from a

### melancholy

### rose.

### Once a large bloom

### nestled in sugarcane,

### no passion crimes committed.

### No one to blame.

### To many days

### without love's sacred rain

### leaves a tear stain

### saturating the earth

### beneath a melancholy rose.

### Floribunda roses

### abundant scents

### tickle the noses

### of passerby's

### oh my!

### Yet

### sometimes the bloom comes singularly

### a heart not privy

### to what's meant to be,

### leaving nothing but a landscape

### of love in repose.

### While tears fall from the eyes

### of a

### melancholy rose.

### Sometimes one bloom stems,

### sometimes a cluster blooms,

### love can grow

### if given the room.

### But the distinction is so very fine...

### a dividing line,

### that over time,

### can disappear,

### and leave nothing but tears,

### falling from the beautiful eyes

### of

### a melancholy rose.

### CAN I (MAKE LOVE TO YOU)

### From the moment I first saw you,

### and asked, "Excuse me, may I have this dance?"

### I looked into your brown eyes and knew,

### we had the makings of a fine romance.

### An enhanced

### deep emotion never felt before,

### I had deep inside,

### holding you close to me as we started to glide.

### Deeper and deeper,

### into a space reserved for two,

### eager, so eager,

### an overwhelming force I couldn't subdue.

### Baby, it's true,

### so very true,

### and now, here we are sharing a love

### long overdue.

### So hold on tonight,

### and let our love games ensue.

### My sweet lady,

### let's share a bottle of Moet,

### I'll draw a bubble bath,

### so you can quietly reflect,

### and when you whisper, "Dee, do you really love me?"

### I'll gently kiss your graceful neck,

### Oh baby,

### My sweet lady,

### with all due respect,

### you've got me so damn erect

### I have to ask,

### please say yes.

### Can I Make Love to You

### all throughout the day,

### please pretty baby,

### may I have a taste of your sweet parfait,

### and when you're soft and wet,

### I promise to give all that you can stand.

### Force your beautiful body,

### To obey all of my commands

### Can I make love to you

### Over and over and over again.

### Baby, when you moan,

### I swear, I hear a symphony,

### a crescendo of orgasmic synchronicity.

### Can we make love all night long,

### baby, you are the epitome,

### of ebony, mahogany perfection,

### and the star of my fantasies,

### dipped in misogyny.

### My sweet lady,

### your children and mine,

### and mine are yours.

### Though your son is from another man,

### he and I share a great rapport,

### and what you and I can't afford,

### we will go without when push comes to shove.

### For so long we paid the price,

### of former lovers who didn't think twice,

### and now, here we are sharing this priceless love.

### Let me call my mother,

### so she can watch the kids,

### for 24 hours, in your love

### is where I need to live.

### Can I Make Love to You,

### all throughout the day,

### please pretty baby,

### may I have a taste of your sweet parfait.

### And when you're soft and wet,

### I promise to give all that you can stand,

### force your beautiful body,

### to obey all of my commands.

### Can I make love to you,

### over and over and over again.

### Deeper and deeper,

### baby, let me explore your anatomy,

### I'm eager, so eager,

### baby, please take all of me.

### Deeper and deeper,

### your love, I swear,

### is beyond compare,

### can't take a breather,

### when I'm tasting you I don't want

### to come up for air.

### Oh pretty baby,

### can I make love to you

### all throughout the day,

### open up baby,

### let me taste your sweet parfait.

### And when you're soft and wet,

### I'll give all that you can stand,

### and force your body,

### you obey all of my commands

### Tell me you want me baby,

### ANSWER ME THAT

### I remember a time

### I used to run for your embrace

### Now I cannot wait to get away

### I do not hate you

### I just hate what you became

### Why do I have to pick up the slack?

### Getting us back to the love, that we once had

### The way you treat me now is whack

### If we ended things today, I will be so glad

### What happened to you would never lie?

### Thought that our love will never die

### Are those things of the past?

### Can you answer me that?

### LOVE IS LOVE

### Whenever I find myself thinking of you

### I close my eyes and I cry

### I feel your spirit next to mines

### As I remember our precious times

### When we made love, you satisfied my all

### You completely took over my soul

### How can I ever forget you?

### You left me in the middle of fall

### I want you back, I miss you boo

### Don't you want me too?

### I cannot keep you out my head

### Damn, I miss the love we made

### TRUE HEART

### You said you loved me, then why do me like this

### Love is not supposed to feel like this

### Is there an ending to this?

### Give me something else besides this

### I gave you my heart and all that

### Did you think it would not end like that?

### You must be crazy to think that

### I am tired of this and that

### I think I want my heart back

### And there is no turning back

### Why do I keep taking you back?

### I don't want that old thing back

### Stay away from me

### I have to get back to me

### You've always been wrong for me

### Now I am going back to loving me

### LEAVE THIS WAY

### I've been going through something's. Please don't judge me but, pray for me to stay strong because I can't take it anymore. I gave our relationship too many chances and it keeps getting worst, why do you keep saying you will when you will not.

### I need a real man, one who treats me with respect, one who knows how to please me, one who makes me feel like I am the only woman in the world. The one who knows my worth.

### I am sick and tire of lames, the lies and those with very little brain. The ones who want to use and abuse me, the one who are so immature, they can even tell them losing.

### I want you out my life, please leave and never come back. I can do badly by my damn self and you know that, I do not need this stress. Forget it this is whack.

### No, I am not killing myself, just getting rid of the trash and out tossing it out door. I do not want this anymore. I love myself too much to continue living like this. I have to start thinking about me. What does love have to do with anything?

### Please leave, go away, the same way you came. I want you to leave but, I know that you going to want to stay. This is a tough decision to make. With all things, consider this is what I have to say is goodbye and leave this way.

### ARE YOU FEELING LONELY?

Look around you

There is always someone there

He never leaves your side

He knows the reasons why you cry

Do you know anyone like him?

Who accepts you as he does?

Can you tell that he really cares for us?

He paid for our sins on a cross

What a friend we have in Jesus

You do not have to ever feel alone

He will always be your true friend

Let us praise him and make amends

Amen !

Amen !

&

Amen

### If you choose to be fancy, represent your Lord & Savior

### Because he's granted you unmerited favor

### So the next time someone states: "You fancy huh?"

### Just think of all that God has done

### And reply yes I am, and I must let you know

### No matter how folk try to emulate you

### Keep in mind you're an original

### No matter what

### You must keep your dignity & class

And allow folk unwise behavior to pass

NO MATTER WHAT

K. SIMPSON

Ms. K Simpson was raised in a small town in Arkansas yet her life's journey would take her multiple places in the United States before allowing her to settle in Atlanta, GA. Her journey has been one that not many women, or men, could have made without losing their minds or lives. However; in order that she could share her God-given talent of easing the pain with words, she had to learn pain. The pain of bearing two beautiful daughters and raising them as a single mother; the pain of losing her mother just before entering adult hood; and assuming the responsibility of her pre- teen sister, while at the same time having to raise her own children; and the pain of losing her paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather, who taught her how a woman should live her life both mentally and spiritually. Her two daughters are now growing into two wonderful women who reflect their mother's love and spirit for life. Ms. Simpson provides evidence that the sacrifices she has made were worth it in order to give her daughters a life far better than her own.

"God Gave Me This Talent" is the opening to another journey. Homeless... that was I, from being in a shelter to sleeping under a bridge, to wondering if I was going to get a meal to eat. I am not asking for your pity or a hand out. Right now, I am here to teach you, and let you know what my life is about. Some of you know parts of my story others of you don´t. The thing about my story it will have you in tears I´m not going to front. Some of you knew me before, get to know me now God has come into my life; I have so much more to live for. The old me is dead so please let her rest. Pay close attention, God has his hands on me. You will finally see me at my best....

### GOD GAVE ME THIS TALENT Is an Inspirational Poetry Book It will inspire you, make you smile, make you laugh and even make you cry. I cover everything from love to break up and just everyday living. This is a must have book....

### YOU'RE A WOMAN

### You're a woman that can hold her own

### You've been through a lot which has made you strong

### You're a woman that won't give up without a fight

### I must say that's one of the things I like

### You're a woman that keeps it all together

### You intimidate people therefore the don't know how to get on your level

### You're a woman that's God Fearing and keeps God First

### People only have something to say about you when you're at your worst

### You're a woman that has changed her life around

### They still throw your past in your face to try to bring you down

### You're a woman that's sacrifice and gave up so much

### You stood on your own and didn't need a crutch

### You're a woman that has a story to tell

### Your test and trials have made you excel

### Your work doesn't go unnoticed  
I admire that even when you're going through it you keep Focus....

I CAN'T STAND A DISRESPECTFUL CHILD

A disrespectful child doesn't live half of their days.

I'm done walking away giving you back to God before I put you in the grave.

I'm all you got at the end of the day

Child please, you will not disrespect me in any kind of way

I brought you in this world and I will take you out

So it's best you watch the words that come out of your mouth

If you have something to say you better not tell anyone but God

Right now child of mine I'm ready to tear you apart

I'm a new Christian I must admit

I'm your mother and will beat the breaks off you if ever get slick....

I can't stand a disrespectful child

Lord give me the strength to calm down I know it's going to take a while

Child you hurt me I'm not going to lie

Your my child someone I could never despise

As Mothers we do our best

From our children we expect the best and nothing less

I can't stand a disrespectful child

I know I've done my best so I give you over to God with a smile....

NEW LADY

### When I saw you with your New Lady  
I thought my heart would skip a beat just maybe

### A smile came upon my face

### At that moment I knew all the painful memories had been replaced

### I'm happy for you and your New Lady

### Oh by the way congratulations on the baby

### I have to get this off my chest

### Why are you still calling my phone, being childish with all that mess?

### When we agreed going our separated ways was for the best

### I don't want you anymore I must confess

### I wish you well in all you do

### You're an X for a reason Damn that statement is so true....

### ABOUT ME

What is it about me that you like?

Go ahead be honest it's alright

Is it the way I walk

Could it be my sexy voice you like to hear when we talk?

Maybe it's my sexy lips

Could it be the way I move my hips

Could it be my bowlegs?

Is it the way I tilt my head

Is it my beautiful smile that shines so bright?

Is it the way I walk away, refuse to argue fuss and fight?

Dig a little deeper if you will

There is more to me then my looks and my sex appeal

What you see is my external beauty

Look a little closer, you will see favor and faith all up in me

A woman of God I say in a loud voice

God got a hold of me, and yes that was the best choice

There is more to me then the naked eye can see

You would know this if you knew anything about me

SUN SHINE

If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up  
I ran across one that has me stuck  
One thing about My SUNSHINE, he's not green or slow  
I have to admit he had me when he walked through the door.  
My first thought who is this man, I need to know more.  
Then I told myself you need to talk to GOD, so I immediately hit the floor  
I asked father is this the man that's in your plan  
Because I had given up on love and decided I didn't want a man  
My father told me you tried it your way now try mine  
This man is different but I sent him just at the right time  
My SUNSHINE walked in my life and brighten up my whole world I started having butterflies and feeling like a teenage girl  
I decided to step outside of the box  
My SUNSHINE is someone I like, no someone I could love a lot

### LOVE'S SANCTUARY

### Come away with me my love to a place where the refreshing scent of love fills the air. A place where happiness feeds the spirit and passion quenches the thirst of the soul. A place where my mind goes every time I am with you. A place where two halves become whole.

Journey with my love to this blissful place of everlasting ecstasy where lovers emotionally consummate and celebrate their love. A place that exceeds the realm of physicality and goes beyond the boundaries of reality and enters into a world of romantic fantasy.

A place where the faithfulness of true and pure love resides. A place where the expression of love is constant and overflowing. A world of unconditional love, steadfast love, everlasting love. a place where the harmony of mind, body, and spirit come together to form the sweet sensual sound that creates a beautiful symphony of love.

### Escape with me to this lovely place my love where two heartbeats become one.

### Take a moment and run away with me to

### W.O.W (WITH OUT WORDS)

Without Words

### she spoke to me

### she formed sentences

### without parting her lips

### her voice yelled without

### speaking one syllable

### screaming in silence

### With Out Words

### she captured my attention

### she told me her life's story

### without using one vocal inflection

### she sang a song of love without lyrics

### a song whispered in silence

### so only I could hear it

### With Out Words

### she touched me deeply

### she kissed me mentally

### she stroked me verbally

### with unspoken words

### and the silence of verbs

### until my mind was full

### With Out Words

### she left an everlasting impression

### with her eyes she pulled forth from me

### the sweetest of expression

### and although she never said one phrase

### she left me thoroughly and completely amazed

### she spoke volumes to my poetic existence

### she spoke endlessly to my guarded heart

### through her eyes with persistence

### With Out Words

### she left me in awe of her quiet verse

### of muted melodies and silent sonnets

### causing my mind to explode and burst

### with elation and appreciation for her unspoken language

### because her silent stares and gentle touch has saved me from my anguish

### With Out Words

### she has freed me from chaos within

### because her quietness has brought calmness

### and a balance to this mind and now it can rest again

### W.O.W

### GOING THROUGH

### Searching for illumination

### I'm trapped and lost in a darkened state

### and although my eyes are wide opened

### I find it hard to actually see the light in front of me

### to see past my eclipsed vision

### my light has been blocked

### my sight is now blurry

### what I see is now distorted

### because my mind is contorted

### and bent around the thoughts of futility

### disjointed by my life's pains

### my agonies and humility

### trying my best to see what's beyond the horizon

### but it's impossible looking through tear stained eyes

### while realizing...

### that this race that I'm running, is meant for me to run alone

### and that the trials that I face, I face alone

### they say that weeping may endure for a night,

### and that joy comes in the morning

### but it's impossible to see your morning

### while you are mourning

### while the pain becomes almost impossible to bare

### and in your heart and mind you're wondering

### if God himself even cares

### about the pain and agony that you are feeling
### about life's hurts that has your mind reeling

### and wondering what's next

### trying to search for strength, and inner peace

### but feeling that you have none left

### wondering.....

### where is my exit? where is my way of escape?

### looking for a door to open

### and release me from this helpless state

### feeling like it is impossible for me to win

### stuck in this revolving door

### that every time it seems like I'm walking out

### I'm actually walking back in

### In to this state

### this place....this feeling

### this feeling of a hopeless....and a purposeless existence

### while trying to find my way out of this darkness

### with persistence

### and while I'm desperately and painfully

### wondering what's next to do

### I hear the voice of GOD

### saying to me

### "THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS IS TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH"

### MY FIGHT

### this is my dilemma

### this is my plight

### the constant struggle within

### the daily fight of wrong and right

### when my flesh

### combats my spirit

### fighting against the

### eternal destiny

### that GOD has invested in me

### when the instincts of my sinful man

### interferes with the purity of

### my spirit man

### when the voices of my n-e-me

### tries to overshadow the voice of God

### in me

### speaking to my thoughts

### tempting my desires

### fighting against the will of God

### for my life

### so here I am

### fighting the thoughts of insecurity

### combating the desperation of obscurity

### trying my best to live a life of purity

### trying to resist lustful intentions

### with the help of meditation

### and heavenly dissensions.

### prevention of exercising my own will

### to partake and entertain carnal and fleshly desires

### to try and cover the void in my life only GOD can fill

### trying to suppress thoughts of wrong

### and embracing thoughts of right

### this is my everyday struggle

### this is.......MY FIGHT

ANTI-POETRY

You don't even inspire me to poetry, no matter how hard I try...

it's like my hand struggles to write the words my mouth hesitates to provide...

I can't color you with my metaphors, I can't paint you with my similes....

it's not that I don't think of you, it's that u fail to touch the heart of me....

I want to write you a love song but you give me no motivation...

what u do is not enough and I'm growing impatient

everything seems so technical, and robotic and feels so strategic

and you've never been that hand to hold, although I very seldom need it.

with you I'm neither sad or ecstatic anymore, I'm just indifferent

And to think that when I met you I thought you were heaven sent

I thought you'd whisk me away, I thought you were exactly what I needed...

in the beginning everything was so easy with you and I just could not believe it

But all the while I knew this couldn't be the answer I was looking for....

you might be close to it, but you've proven to me that I deserve more.

You don't even inspire me to poetry, it makes no sense to pretend...

but when you're willing to be my lyrics, I'm willing to pick back up my pen.....

HYPOCRISY

### Why is it that if a celebrity breaks a law they do 30 days in rehab?

### If a civilian breaks the same law, they get a fine, or are doing time no questions asked?

### To put it plain there must be a consequence to abusing fame

### Maybe if there was truly a price to pay the behavior wouldn't be the same

### Yes I agree no matter what your salary we are only human and make mistakes

### But what if your actions put a freeze on all your assets including the cash in the bank?

### Then let's see how quickly you'll let Captain Morgan help you operate your vehicle

### Or raise your hand to a woman, break probation or secretly borrow from a department store

### But I guess if the White House has had so many scandals and most of the culprits are walking free

### Why should we expect anything different from a so called celebrity?

### Perhaps I'm missing something but I can't help but feel

### Rather than setting the chaos straight we reward the problem instead of taking steps to rebuild

### Now celebrities are getting born every 15 seconds,

### not due to their skill because they have no talents

### Famous because of the volume of their voice or how foolish they behave

### Guess it doesn't matter what they are saying about you as long as they have something to say

### On the other hand it's like the public thrives on gossip and other people's tragedies

### They say they aren't supposed to be our role models, but let's infiltrate their lives, increase the paparazzi!

### Let's scrutinize every action, make it larger than it seems

### Forgetting that if there was a camera in your own living room what exactly would we see

### But when it comes to living in a glass house, stones can appear quite heavy

### Especially when boulders start to fly through your windows of hypocrisy

### POTENTIAL

### He has potential, but a part of my heart still belongs to you

### How can I make it to my future while my past is still in view?

### I try to shake your image from my head

### But dreams of you still follow me when I lay in my own bed

### I wonder if he notices I wonder if he can tell

### He is a breath of fresh air, but you know me so very well

### He wants to show me things I've never seen before

### Wants to give me everything, wants to give me the world

### Would roll out the red carpet and lay rose petals at my feet

### Would carry me a thousand miles if I were to grow weary

### He wants to do everything for me including the things of which you failed

### But for some reason I rather stand on the deck of a ship that's already sailed

### I must be crazy

### I must be insane

### I must be losing my mind

### My heart is my own worst enemy to fight it I've tried

### Every time I look in his eyes I see his potential

### If I was to compare the two of you, history is more influential

### But then again, when he kisses me I feel no pain

### The pain you caused me, when with no regrets you just walked away

### And now you have returned as if I'm your prize to claim

### And although I may have loved you once, I am over the game

### So please be on your way, because what I felt still isn't strong enough

### To keep me locked in the past as a prisoner to your touch

### I'd rather take the risk that he will continue to keep my feet off the ground

### I'd rather believe in a possibility that in him true love can be found

### I'd rather keep laughing as he knows what to do to make me a smile

### I'd rather spend my precious moments doing something worthwhile

### So forgive me but I thought you should be the first to know

### It may sound crazy but I'd rather see his potential

### 700 MESSAGES

### 700 messages and none of them from you

### I'm checking my email minute by minute in case one slipped through

### Alas it doesn't matter how many times I check

### Still no email from you in my in box yet

### Yes I know only a day has went by

### But I can't help it I can't keep you off of my mind

### I thought that perhaps maybe we were on the same path

### But with you subtracted from the equation, I don't want to do the math

### Hours later 700 messages nothing has changed

### Aside from the increase in my desire to begin typing your name

### My heart skips a beat because now it says 701

### I click the button anxious to see who it's from

### Damn its nothing but my horoscope to ask me about love and luck

### If the cards only knew that I wish they'd just shut the hell up

### I'm tapping my foot and typing away

### Will I get an email from you at all today?

### How can I sit here with you on the brain?

### While you're out and clearly not doing the same

### It's not fair; I need to shake it, got to shake this feeling, set me free!

### But the truth of the matter is I wonder do you wait around for a message from me?

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO

ROMANCE

Whatever happened to romance?

No seriously I wanna know, was a bill passed in the Senate, and I just didn't get the memo?

Did Barack Obama accidentally veto something when he instated health care reform?

Or in order to recover from the recession did the cost of quality time go up to a price that people can't afford?

Did Flowers stop growing out the ground due to the shift in the poles and global warming?

All I'm trying to say is romance was kidnapped, stolen, disappeared with no warning.

I'm not an old fashioned girl, not asking for a horse and carriage

But I never thought I'd see the day when romance would perish

Some say the independent woman killed romance

Took it by the neck and strangled it in her bare hands

Trying to prove she can do everything that a man can

And instead of accepting a woman as being strong and taking care of herself until a good man comes along that can provide some assistance and appreciate

The independent woman gets a bad rap and gets called a hypocrite

If she wishes a man would pay on the first date.

Or maybe he's the accomplice to romance's abduction, such a crime

Cuz see the women keep pleasing his body but forget to please his mind

What is the point in working for something you can get for free?

Can't choose between them 'cuz they are all doing the same thing

He seen her eyes get big when he pulled his wallet out his pocket

She didn't have a thing to say to him, but when she seen his car suddenly his stock sky rockets

She doesn't pay her own rent and can't even pump her own gas

She's got this sense of entitlement, so she doesn't hesitate to ask

Of him for things she doesn't deserve

Those very things that he worked hard for to earn

So I'm not sure who is the suspect or the victim as a result of the loss of romance

All I know is it's a cold hard world out there; perhaps it never

Stood a chance

Romance you may have gone missing but I'm holding on to hope, I know that

You're not dead

I'm alerting the authorities, it's an amber alert, I had a dream I found you and

This is what I said:

Romance we miss you, seems like your gone without a trace. We know there are imposters out there, sad excuses but you can't be replaced. You may be hard to describe but I'll try...you are thoughtful simplicity.

Until we are reunited

I'll ask again

Whatever Happened to Romance?

### RELENTLESS

### In her pursuit of happiness she set her sights on me

### In her heart and mind we were meant to be

### Who knew she was right? Right from the start

### Her plan was hatched and although I denied my love for her

She slowly stole my heart

### The unthinkable was done her plot was at full scheme

### And though I tried to resist, her love was now my theme

### Struggle as I might her grip on me was tighter then all at once I told her...

### Just how I felt for her, I loved her like no other

### No other love I've ever known

### A love I once refused now I call my own

### A love that I will cherish for the rest of my life

### A love so true to my heart

### I'm making her my wife

### I love you babe....

### NOT RIGHT NOW

### What is it I'm too busy I don't have time to talk?

### Instead of slowing down a bit I speed up my steps and walk

### Ignoring what could be the blessing of my life

### I simply walk away and say I have no time today

### I'm busy doing nothing I turn and walk away again using those same words

### I have neither time today I didn't have time yesterday nor time the day before yet you sit there patiently waiting until I have the time

### It's not like you're pan handling or begging on the street

### You want to share your message yet I make no time for thee

### I constantly avoid you yet you make time for me

### How can you do this every day and not give up on me?

### Maybe I will stop one day and hear what you have to say I didn't stop yesterday nor did I stop today yet you keep on

### You persist, you're determined, you won't give up on me

### I wonder what you have to say curiosity has peaked within me

### Maybe tomorrow I will stop and see what you have to say

### I was just too busy going nowhere fast

### I just had to be somewhere, somewhere avoiding you

### I admit I wasn't too busy I just didn't want to stop

### Every day I know you're there and I expect you to be

### And now I realize it's you Jesus you never gave up on me

### You never turned your back on me, you waited patiently

### Today I listened to you and your message was so clear, although I was ignoring you, you always stayed right there reminding me of your love for me and the sacrifice you made

### They crucified you Jesus but you conquered the grave

### You remind me daily of that sacrifice

### And because of this dear Jesus I offer you my life

### All the time I wasted passing you each day I am grateful that you waited Lord I'm grateful every day I thank you lord almighty for showing me the way I hope that many follow the path you set for me

### I hope they see the light as I do and they change their lives too

### I hope they see that your love is here and here to stay

### You need to follow Jesus

### For he's the only way

### CHANGE

### Things change, people change, all around the world

### What once was a little boy is now a grown up girl

### Who am I to judge them what am I to say if that's the life you want to live

### Hey do ya thing just be fair to people and always treat them right

### Making this world a better place can't happen overnight

### The bible says to love your neighbor as you love yourself

### But if you do not love yourself then how can you love another

### Love is not just automatic like the love you get from mother

### Love is caring; love is kind and love it never fails

### Love is many things love is given freely 'cause love don't cost a thing

### Change will happen at some point, when people start to care if not this world will be a lonely place because no one will be there, to talk to or text or

### Even say hello

### They say that change is good, but who the hell are "they" they always have a lot to say but we know not

### who they be the world needs to change and now and worry about your fellow man and not focusing on ME

### What if we all did that for once what a world it would be with peace and love and quiet storms and love and harmony? Imagine watching news reports when there's no talk of war or crimes of any sorts what a change for the better what a joy this place could be if everyone just did their part the way God planned it to be a paradise wouldn't that be special yeah that'd be pretty nice

### A LITTLE GIRL I KNOW

J ust when my life was without meaning you came into my world

A gift from God above an Angel sent to make me smile again

Every time I look at you I know my purpose in life

L oving you and guiding you and watching as you grow

Y ou were chosen just for me you brought joy into my life

N ow I have another chance to make a difference in the world

N ever will I take for granted what you mean to me

R ejoicing in the gift I've been given

### I cherish everyday

A ll the memories we create each day

### and all the laughter we share

Everyone will know your name and

### what you mean to me

B orn in October the same birth month

as mine

A s you grow I see the change in

### you each day

L earning something new each day

### and sharing what

### you learn

L oving you every second and praying

### for your

### safety always

O h how proud I am to be your father

### I hope one day

### you see

U nique you are in every way and so special to me

### HEY MOMMY ...

I miss you every day; I really hate that cancer that made you go away

I have another daughter now one that you didn't get to meet

A gift from God I tell you that girl is super sweet

I guess everything is planned out well in advance

I'm getting married too this June and will miss you for our dance

I'm glad that you're not sick anymore and out of all your pain I'd give anything on earth I have to hear you laugh again

To taste another meal you cooked some greens or mac and cheese

I think about you every day hoping you're watching over me

Hoping that you approve of the father I've become

Knowing that I fathered three but only see just one

The other two have turned their backs on me

I pray that God watches over them and always keeps them safe

It's tough when you think you're grown while making all those mistakes

God knows how much I love them and want them here with me

But they themselves have different plans

Whatever will be will be

I'm glad I had this talk with you I hope you're in God's grace

One day I too will pass and get to see your face

### COUNT IT ALL JOY

You complain all day, yet do nothing with gifts

You carry your weight, but others you won't lift

You say why me, but God says why not you

You're not exempt from what you don't do

Get off your high horse and put down your saddle

Get in the same boat with others and paddle

Your life is not better or worse than most people

Just too busy whining, expecting not to be equal

Have you ever thought about your condition?

Sat back and pondered what if God didn't pay attention

If He took your current situation and gave it away

Would they take it and turn it into a pitcher of lemonade

Would they be better off than you are right now?

Same scenario, condition and you're wondering how

Same job, same car, but one thing has changed

They looked at the brightness of a clear new day

Fresh anointing come down, no room for fear

New breath, good health and a family that's near

They take what they've got and they turn it around

By helping those out who seem to be down

They're blessings are abundant, no wishes and hadn't.

They didn't moan about the ones that had it

They got a blessing from what they put out

The spirit that moved them, the same one that showed out

He made things happened they never dreamed of

Because they simply reflected God's love

The kind you give just because it feels right

Not seeking to gain, or escape your own plight

Never changes if you keep on doubting

The power of The Father, The One True King

The one with lullabies in hearts to sing

Sooth your troubles, lifts your spirits

Kinder hearts with joy surrender

Regardless of past or present tragedies

Count it all joy in face of adversity

Be thankful what you have today

Count your blessings in all the ways

What's yours

could be someone else's break

Your success is

His but yours to make

### I WANT TO BE

Steamy, water, musk, jasmine

I want to be the towel that dries you off

Fried chicken, collard greens, yams

I want to be the be the juice you lick off your lips

Shoulders squared, dark brown mounds, grinds

I want to be the dance in your song

Balls, basket, squats, shoves

I want to be the jump in your shot

Cool, fresh, deep inhale

I want to be the first breath you take

Quick rhythm, hunch, thrust

I want to be the skin you touch

Slow winding, chest rising

I want to be the space in your hold

Smile, laughter, joy, peace

I want to be the happy in your lucky

Anywhere, everywhere, here or there

I want to be... just for you.

### PRETTY

### Brown hands, soft, smooth.

### Polished nails, limber legs

### Hands on hips,

### Quiet eyes

### Scraps, falls, wounds made whole

### Belts slung, dough kneaded

### Pots lifted, mouths fed

### Floors scrubbed, homework learned.

### Buttons sewn, hugs warm.

### Daddy happy. Sleep real good

### Squeaky bed. Worn wood

### Hair frazzled. Body worn

### Years gone. Children grown

### Honey, Mama, Grandma's born

### Brown hands, soft, wrinkle

### Creases, dimples, voice tempered

### Breasts, pillows, gravity set

### Hips, thighs, small back

### Eyes round...lashes black

### Smiling still. Daddy's home.

### Squeaky bed. Worn wood.

### Cognac, jazz, blues, dance

### Squeak bed. Worn wood.

### Daddy smiles. Daddy knows

### Pretty still. Pretty does

### SINNERS HAVE SOUL TOO

### In my mind you're already a part of me

### In my soul you have already called upon me

### It is said at the moment we think it or believe

### We have already committed in our hearts to perceive

### That through free will, emotion, conscience and intellect

### We must serve a purpose, something better than random sex

### It's harder than it seems to folks like me

### Struggling to do right in itself is a grief.

### With an inherited sin from my parents Adam and Eve

### Who had no cellphones, internet or cable TV

### Were they faced with temptations like you and me?

### Hell, even I could've avoided a simple ass apple tree

### But I sin everyday thinking about his stallion-like powers.

### I sin in my dreams; my most sinful hours.

### Not to mention his craving for my edible flowers

### But part of me prays that my urges subside

### And I'll have a breakthrough and my eyes opened wide

### But as soon I say that last amen, I'm back to craving him all over again

### I never knew sin could feel so good and splendid

### Exhausted from resisting, I call your name in a whimper

### But honestly, I didn't want to be hindered

### He's a talented...talented man. You knew I'd surrender

### His lips, his hands, my... OOOOh, my thighs

### Got damn the price of sin is too high

### I overflow into this warmth of greedy sin once again

### No cuddling, no pillow talk, no awkwardness or shame

### My mouth and tongue welcome him in just the same

### I am more than a pair of thick legs, big ass and curvy thighs,

### Never asking the what's, never bothering with the whys

### Just the when's, the where's and what time

### I was raise to know better, I am a child of the most high

### But these feelings of mine keep getting heavier each time

### I want to be new, I want to be anointed

### But I'm sure this sex thing has definitely got you disappointed

### But praying isn't enough for someone like me

### Lonely, hungry, starving to be pleased

### If sexing is a sin, Jesus why can't you get it in

### I always wanted some of that holy loving, mortal kind of sin

### You said you'd be lover, my friend, whatever I need

### So come help me conquer this deadly seed.

### Until such time, I'll probably sin some more.

### But praying one day it'll be you at my door.

### MY GIFT

### Your eyes are like diamonds, they sparkle and shine

### I thank God each day that your heart is mine.

### You make my heart flutter, it soars and it flies

### I feel the depth of your love when I look in your eyes.

### Your embrace it inspires, your kisses set fire

### The heat from your touch, it makes me perspire.

### God gave me a gift the day he gave me you...

### My life is now complete and I could never be blue.

### Always know that you are deep in my heart

### And forever and always we never will part.

### SOME DAYS

### Some Days Are Diamonds

### Some Days Are Dust...

### Some Days Smell Sweet

### And Some Smell Like Must....

### Some Days Your The Flower

### And Some Days Your The Thorn...

### And Some Days You Feel

### Like You Can Grab The Bull By It's Horn's...

### Some Days You Have Power

### And Some Days You Are Weak..

### Some Days You May Be

### On A Hot Winning Streak...

### Some Days There Is Pain

### And Some Days There Is Love...

### But We Gather Our Strength

### From The Good Lord Above

### But Always Remember

### There Is Only One You...

### And From That One Seed

### One Amazing Soul Grew!

### IF I WAS GONE TOMORROW

If I was gone tomorrow

Would you still remember me?

Would happy thoughts and memories

Be all that's left to see?

Would bad words you might have said

Come back to haunt your soul?

Would you have wished that you could take back?

Those words that was so cold?

Would you have wanted to say one last time?

How much I might have meant?

But now it's only too late

For words you might have said...

Would I still be in your heart?

Where I had a special part...

Would you remember back to the day?

That our friendship had its start?

If you only had one chance to say what you could say...

Would it be?

"I care"

"I'm sorry"

"I love you"

Before I went away?

Remember there may never be a tomorrow

To make things right again...

And no matter what you say to me,

### I'll still always be your friend.

IN THE EYES OF A CHILD

### In the eyes of a child,

### You see innocence and love

### The beauty in their being,

### Is a gift from up above.

### They look to your voice,

### To console them from pain

### Your trust and honesty,

### You must always maintain.

### They look to your arms,

### To protect them from harm

### Their smiles and their giggles,

### Are just parts of their charm?

### In the eyes of a child,

### You can do no wrong

### They look to mommy and daddy

### To always be strong.

### They want you to kiss,

### All their boo-boos away

### They need you to tell them,

### That everything is okay.

### So each night at bedtime,

### Be sure to kiss them goodnight

### And always take your role as parent

### With such utter delight!

### LOVED ONES LOST

### We miss those we have lost,

### We miss them every day.

### Our heart it starts to break

### Since the day they went away.

### We don't get to hear their laugh,

### We don't get to see their smile,

### We can feel their spirit near

### And wish they could stay awhile.

### We miss their warm embrace,

### The expressions on their face,

### And we know in our heart

### That no one could ever take their place.

### The smell of their perfume,

### Their presence in the room,

### They are angels on our shoulders

### And they protect us from all doom.

### Is it only in your mind?

### Did they leave you far behind?

### Or will your souls always and forever

### Be together and entwined?

STUCK ON YOU

The moment that we met

Our hearts intertwined

Our eyes locked together

and I knew that you'd be mine

As days grew to weeks

my love for you grew stronger

our minds became infused

we belonged to one another.

it was pointless to deny

that I was stuck on you,

So easy to imply

we were amongst the chosen few...

loving one another

has brought a new dimension

our bodies intertwined

without an ounce of tension

when you kiss me, I start to melt

our love is real, so deeply felt

you caress me and I long for more

being stuck on you

is a feeling that I adore!

flaming love fuels our passion,

my body starts to quiver

a most natural reaction

we never want to part

even for one day

Let's stay together

intertwined in this way!

I am hopelessly stuck on you.

I AM A DIVA

I am a diva...

divine,

delightful,

dependable

I embrace the divinity of the

beautiful queens

who have come before me

I delight in just being

I am who I am and I make

no excuses for being me

I am a diva....

intelligent, intuitive, iconic

No one can tell me

what I cannot do

for as long as I think I can,  
I can and I WILL!!

### I am a diva...

vivacious

victorious

vibrant

I embrace all aspects of me

the good parts with the bad

knowing that I am loved

I am a diva...

artistic

altruistic and active

in all that I undertake

using my God given talents

for the betterment of humanity

I am a diva...

Aren't you?  
AURA

Mind numbing illumination

Brilliant beyond the

Brightest rainbows

War scars prominently

Displayed like

incandescent

Ink spots

For the world To see

Headlights that blare

Showing the pathway

Back to life

This is the aura of me

### TALKING TO A SHADOW

Why am I walking all alone, holding a hand of a distant man, making love to a dangerous mist small pecks and kisses across a shadows lips, I imagined you were here keeping me safe in loves embrace, taking all my fears away and promising everything would be OK, dictating love and pressing so hard to keep our courtship as high as the most farthest star, this damn lump in my throat make me feel as if I wanna choke my fist full of tears up in the air like smoke, I mean I pray and I pray and I pray every day that god will bring u back to me in the same way.

### SHE'S SOMETHING LIKE A $$$$$ STAR

### She's something like a super freak the most unique woman you could ever meet, at night she ignites with 3 shots of henny she comes alive, you fear this marvelous creature she's the sexiest intoxicant and will deceive ya, her mind is wild and riddled with the most intoxicating sounds, pleasurable positions missionary isn't her mission she's a rider for real now take your seat it's time to get peeled, her high performance is diminutive, unsound, and implicated to all around, many have tried and many have failed to try and define this beauty of mine

A GANGSTERS TEARS

You lay awake at night questioning every thought that has crossed your mind but the only question that comes to you is why, you fail to answer your own question with hopes of receiving a blessing, an angel comes to with full embrace come my child take me in you are not at fault for all your sin, you are but a product of survival deep in your heart holds the words of the bible, attack if you must it's for survival you trust, war driven you're a soldier my man my king my protector with a ring, all your tears I see here on your shirt I wanna wipe it away to stop the pain you stop the hurt, let me help allow for me to save you, bring you to be the man I see today, no longer will you hurt no longer will you cry I will wipe only happy tears from your eyes, so rise my gangsta rise my king and let you rule this earth with iron hearts with like the arc angel that sings.

### ORIGINAL ONE

I'm destined for greatness no matter what form I may come in, but no matter what u try I'll always be embedded in your skin, try and shake me maybe try and replace me I'd like to see you try, I fit to you like an original she just maybe a replicate or something like it but just not me, I have to laugh sometimes cause I remember all of your screams, your laughs, your smiles the freaky shit you said when we got wild, I mastered my riding skills strictly by climbing a mountain to the very top, I remember the night I victimized you I took it you loved it you swore no one could touch it, my number yup number 7 pleasure my middle name it's your mind body and soul I claim, you can call me Jordan I have yet to retire I have to many years and I'm full of fire. Even when all the players are played out I'll still be the one you dream about

### DON'T WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND

Look what you did you put it on me to the point where I couldn't recognize me, feeling you in my sleep then waking up with wet sheets, feeling your strong hands around me feeling like a fiend between my weak ass knees I feel like I lost you in the midst of all this hate, the love we had use to be so great, breakfast in bed giving you that morning head there's was nothing greater than that, making love to you without a hat, my baby my lover my friend I would've traded my heart just to hold you again, but now that love is gone I've thrown you away with the rest of the trash I forgot about you, you and ya lying ass. Gave you the best you know it's true. There will never be another one like me, duplicate me try and you will just wind up with tears in your eyes, holding ya pillow every night wanting me by I could never Be your friend nor would try.

### HIGH SCHOOL YEARS

A brother is born for adversity,

Conversations including nothing more than:

SEX, DRUGS, ALCOHOL and PARTIES

Instead of acting classy, the girls are acting trashy

One freshman girl became a trending topic-

"Baby Prostitute" was her new name

-What an awful, horrible claim to fame!

My peers don't understand me

I am radical and keen

I don't have to belong to a "clique" to be happy

Why do girls feel the need to be?

a freak in the bed AND a freak in the streets?

Belly poked out-Pregnant at fourteen

She envies me, simply because

of her own insecurities

But I don't mind, cause my

mom taught me to love my enemies

I walk the halls completely as an individual-

Because I'm not afraid to face my fears,

I have succeeded in walking upright during my high school years

### MY NEXT STEP

### What is this dazzling little diva up to NOW?

### Single again, she's back on the prowl

### She is soooo successful...

### OMG!

### How?

### Embracing the grace of God,

### While reaching for the stars

### She has countless accolades

### Not one or two, but three pleasurable cars

### Take a glimpse into her future

### Here are her subsequent plans:

### First step, is finding a GOD-FEARING man!

### Next step, she is gracefully strutting across the stage,

### Attention!! Everyone, Rakaylveia Rush is about to graduate!

### Class of 2011-

### Enthusiastic about a brand new start!

### This special, bright lady will always keep heaven,

### At the center of her heart

### CHOICES

Which will you choose- HBCU or PWI?

Support your people then you will soar and fly

Pick the school that helps you reach the sky

There is a decision to be made

You should choose a school where your dreams will not fade

Some say diversity is the best environment for you-

Only if you want your identity to be screwed!

Being a minority makes you feel inferior-

Even though God lets you know you are nothing less than SUPERIOR!

Of course it's nice to experience different cultures...

But when you forget where you come from

You begin to feel ignorant and dumb!

How does it feel to be the majority?

This is definitely a place that everyone should see!

It's full of vibrant women, doing vibrant things!

Don't know about you- but this totally relates to me!

A place where you'll feel special,

on this campus- its OK to be unique!

This place was built for women who look just like you!

Once in a lifetime experience...

Thank God this place isn't like everywhere else!

Preparing you to be confident and magnificent

A choice to change the world-

### I HAVE MADE MY DECISION!

Blessed and Highly Favored

Miss Future CEO / Corporate Diva

Of 5000 applicants I was chosen to receive a full ride

First Generation, Spelman College graduate

Blessed and highly favored- I'm determined to STRIVE

Transforming myself, by the renewal of my mind

Forgetting all the bad stuff, I left it all behind

Pushing forward, diligently

An extravagant future awaits me

No longer anxious about tomorrow-

I no longer have to entertain sorrow

HOLY rolling, riding in my ravishing, red Range Rover

Raki is all of that

She's confident and intelligent-

And struts with a twist

She has diamonds in her backyard and diamonds on her wrist!

This STRONG woman of God

Knows her purpose

She is determined to win against all odds!

Praises to God because he saved her-

She knows it's only because she is Blessed and Highly Favored

### GOOD FRIENDS

### Good friends are there to keep you sane

### Good friends can tell when you need comfort while struggling with pain

### No matter how selfish or rebellious you start to become

### Good friends know how to get the job done!

### Good friends realize that when we are our least loveable

### That we desperately need to be extremely hug-gable

### They comfort you when the going gets tough

### They tell you to stick it out when things begin to get rough

### Teenagers face a lot of uncertainties,

### But nothing beats a good friend who treats you like family

### Good friends are the main reason you fall into debt

### Since you love them, even if they ignore you

### you will never be able to forget

### If you have a good friend hold on tight

### Whatever happens, forgive them if you ever get into a fight

### These days, good friends are short in supply

### and hard to come by

### WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN

### Life has a funny way of happening

### We have our minds set on what we think we need; what we think

### We deserve...

### We have a plan

### For everything...

### Then we fall in love and our needs change; our wants change...

### Something inside changes...

### I changed when my heart met yours...

### I realized that there was a connection...

### My heart ached for a chance to be yours

### Then that "funny" way happened

### And things changed...

### Before I knew it, someone else was there loving you, making you happy

### And I started thinking about what could have been...

### With us, between us, for us...

### I still think...

### And I still wonder...

### What could have been?

MUSIC OF THE SEASON

The air becomes cool as fall makes way for winter

The wintry breeze signals the music in the air

Carols, jingles, hymns...

That's the music of the season

Music that tells how this all came to be

Music that tells the joy of it all

"Joy to the world, the world is come..."

A world that is now filled with uncertainty and fear

'O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining..."

Stars that give light to the dim places in our hearts

Our hearts...sometimes filled with sadness

"It is the light of our dear Savior's birth..."

The light...it shines all around us

Lighting our paths to this season...

A season of joy and hope...

### It's the music in the air...

UNCERTAINTY

It started one day just by the way you looked at me

And said, "Hey beautiful!"

Something was different...

And I began to wonder what you were thinking...

About me...

Our conversations revealed the interest

But I read between the lines and discovered the uncertainty

You felt

Your past experiences have blurred your vision of happiness

It has made you second-guess what you are feeling

That's what uncertainty does...

It makes you wonder and have doubts

About what we could have

I see the uncertainty in your eyes...

Especially when you are looking down at me...

I hear the uncertainty in your voice...

When you call...

Just to see how I am

I feel the uncertainty when you touch me

And I wonder if you will ever give us a chance

To discover what is there...

### The uncertainty

UN-EXPECTATION

### Expectation...Anticipation

### The feeling is indescribable...

### Your heart skips a beat...

### And then it happens...

### You happened...

### And the feeling is indescribable...

### My heart continues to skip...

### You happened...

### And I wonder how?

### How did you become such an important part of my life? My heart?

### So fast...

### You happened...

### And the anticipation...

### Of hearing your voice...

### Of seeing you...

### Of you touching me...

### Is indescribable...

### You happened...

### And my heart is not the same...

### As it was the day before I met you...

### Unexpected...

### Un-Expectation...

### THE PAIN IS EVER PRESENT

In my heart, mind, and soul

The pain caused by your words

Your actions...

They tell me that your words are just that...

Words

Words that give me hope

Then tear me down

Without ever thinking just what they do to me

"I love you..."

"I need you..."

"I want you..."

Cutting just like a knife

Slicing through my veins

Slicing through my heart

I love you because you make me whole

I need you because you give us purpose

I want you because I love you; I need you...

So, why do I feel so much pain?

Why do I feel so alone?

"I love you..."

"I need you..."

"I want you..."

### ON THIS DAY

On this day I lay on my back on a cold surgery table

Unconscious from anesthesia

Hoping that the neurosurgeons will be able

Will their cranial intrusion save my body from seizures?

I wish time could sit back and take breather

Take me back to the days when life was carefree

I'm twenty four years old and looking at the cemetery

When you come that close to being buried

There's little time to worry

Without surgery you have two weeks to live is what he said

Or you can let us go inside and mill around your head

My life hangs in the balance

What choice do I have?

I'd rather be a vegetable than lying dead on slab

Life is all I have and I'm determined to live it

Face all trials and tribulations that come my way

Make the best of the conditions I was given

I hoped for the best

Laying with my life on the line

Preparing for the ultimate test

No study group this time

For this day in the year 2008

I lay on a hospital bed unsure of my fate

6:18 am I awake headed down to surgery

But as fate would have it I was destined to awake

Awake to a skull that is still in two pieces

But through it all my soul has become complete

I've adjusted to life with epilepsy

A small token that the reaper left me

But don't weep for me

He left me here to give you this poetry

I've gone through so much pain

All wrapped in my brain

If it all didn't happen the same

My life would be a shot in the dark

A roll of the dice and a stroke of the heart

I embrace the reaper b/c he embraced me

Yet he gave me back and I give myself too you

Transforming my soul into my words

Pouring my heart out into a pen

Then building the courage to recite these words

On this day I faced death and found new life

### FORBIDDEN PLEASURE

### I desire what I can't have

### I long for what I can't touch

### My mind is telling me a hard no

### But my flesh oh my flesh is feeling such a soft yes

### I should try my best and stay away

### When these feelings begin to feel

### I'm like a fiend without a hit

### When desire hits all mesmerizing & tantalizing

### I stand there poised and ready

### Hoping obedience can override desire

### Self-restraint is an impossible must

### Because if you know like I know

### These pleasures just seem to have their own little way

### From the touch, the kiss, or the caress

### This forbidden pleasure does its best

### What is it about forbidden pleasure?

### Maybe because they can be dealt at a never-ending measure

### Or maybe it's just the stigma or taboo

### Our flesh desires what our hearts know is wrong

### Whether it's X-rated, drug related, or fixated

### We each have our own

### What's yours?

### GRAFFITI

### I am graffiti misplaced but I still grab your attention

### I'm graffiti enjoy my bright colors

### Enjoy the fact that I take residence wherever I feel

### No amount of paint can dismiss my presence

### I'm always visible for everyone to see

### Giving character to sidewalks

### The only life left an abandoned warehouse

### Even industry can fall victim to America

### Not me

### Every city you go too

### I'm there look at me

### They call me graffiti

### I'm the artistic representation of our youth

### Not just the inner city youth

### Yes suburbia I have yours too

### They rush to spray me wherever

### So much life packaged into one can

### I'm a voice with no sound

### Its sign language

### The underworld and hierarchy of those that love to dabble

### I like to think of me as a cool even sometimes dangerous game of scrabble

### Rushing around town looking for spaces to fill with my words

### They call it tagging and why for everyone to see

### They all do it for the love of me

### I tell the tells of generations of our misunderstand children

### Children who grew to be those misunderstood teens

### Who knew that there was message in them that just had to get out?

### You take all the bullshit you can and then the real you begin to boil out

### When you have that need that your inner self is going to come leaking out

### Head to Wal-Mart's paint section and then a check out

### I am bought as paint

### But as I begin to be the vessel of communication I become the true me

### I become graffiti

### CONTINUUM OF LOVE

### Baby let me take you on my continuum of love

### I want to wrap you in the universe of my affection

### Let my love be your solar system

### And I would like for my heart to be your guiding star

### Emotions taking off at the speed of light

### My continuum of love is filled with wonder

### Galaxies of passion and constellations filled with romance

### We can orbit in a path of bliss

### Warm me with solar flares of your lust

### Let my quasar fill your black hole

### As we cause our big bang

### Bless me with a proto star

### Our little proto star who will grow in the continuum of our love

### Dependability and stability will hold us down like gravity

### My heart beats at the speed of light for you

### 186,000 miles per second just at the sight of you

### Let our spirits merge like colliding matter forming a new planet

### Baby step into my space age as we ride on my continuum of love

### THE MAKINGS OF A MAN

### Let's talk father to son

### I want you to understand the makings of a man

### That there's always a struggle for your emancipation

### I only want you to understand

### The factors that contribute to the makings of a man

### Life sometimes she can be so sweet

### But don't let her gentle ways and happy days fool you

### Life can be a bitch son

### She can bring you down if you let her

### See when you're a teenager you're invincible

### Typically living life without principle

### Trapped in a disillusioned flow of adolescence

### Drifting from trend to trend and lifestyle to lifestyle

### All to become mentally aware of your true essence

### After you've tipped your hat at graduation

### That's when life gets real

### It's a big world out there and I want you to be ready

### College isn't every man's dream but a paycheck should be steady

### Hard work is nothing to be ashamed of

### Do not be fearful of independence son

### Some of the tough guys you see

### Wouldn't have time to be the thugs they pretend to be

### But when you don't provide it gives you time to hide

### Standing on a block all day doesn't sustain you

### It only entertains the authority of the jurisdiction that claims you

### Long enough to sweep the block

### And 48 hours later some judge is preparing to arraign you

### Now I'm not condemning you I want to encourage you

### That your head can be more than a rack for fitted caps

### And that your environment does not make you

### Take my lead son and do everything to rise above

### Next on the list son is love

### How you love can be your truest test

### Love hard and love strong

### When you choose a woman think of all the strong women in your life

### When she is weak you be her rock

### Some men have forgotten their position

### A woman is more than just a surface for stroking or an entrance for poking

### These are our flowers sent from above to usher in new life

### Your woman should be your friend

### And if she isn't worthy of that then she is not one to be laid with

### You don't have to lay with every woman who will no matter how you feel

### Too many lives have been created and destroyed because of a cheap thrill

### Find that woman whose voice shakes your soul

### Her walk causes an earthquake in your heart

### Her touch can cause you to poke a hole through your pants

### Now that is true romance

### Last but not least one day you will be right where I am

### Well if you listen you should be

### The most essential thing I can say is be a father to your children

### Money alone isn't love and doesn't equal time

### You have to be there good or bad through thick & thin

### Because you will be what will make a man for him or her

### Once you make that child your clock starts

### Love is a 24/7 365 job

### I know you think I am beginning to ramble about what I want you to be

### But the MAN I truly want you to be is

### a MAN like ME

MY MOTHER'S NAME IS BEAUTY

My mother's name is beauty.  
Her poised greatness  
steered me to where I am today.  
Her heart sprung open and poured love  
Her poised greatness  
taught me to be all that I could  
her heart sprung open and poured love,  
a love that could never be duplicated  
Taught me to be all that I could,  
she cheered my growth and visions  
a love that could never be duplicated  
speaking only good  
she cheered my growth and visions  
she laughed not of foolishness  
speaking only good  
she fasted and prayed for others sake  
while songs of praise stayed  
forever in her mouth  
like the love that stayed in her heart  
My mother's name is beauty.

HAIKU'S

Untitled

My grandfather died  
without enough time,  
I loved that man deep.  
Thinking of you, while  
chewing on my inner cheek  
wetness consumes me.

If I were a man,  
The pleasure would be all mine  
to deem you girly  
My "icicle" heart  
Is no longer your playground!

I'm sure you're cold now.  
Consumed by your love  
My thoughts on you stay moving  
I stopped at a green light

WOMANIZER  
I will no longer  
Be a part of your bean soup.  
The wandering stops!

SO SAD  
My depth of winter  
Is the realization of:  
My cold lonely nights

FISH OUT OF WATER (For Haiti)

Tainted blood? My blood is tainted?  
I bleed red just like they do  
I cry my tears from my eyes,  
same as them  
My silent tears can't fix  
this un-established unsettled feeling  
Tears flow into streams,  
then rivers,  
and floods  
They can't wash this lie clean,  
the sense of belonging I once felt  
I SIMPLY DON'T BELONG  
That's what they want me to believe  
That's what they are saying  
Faceless, nameless, and shameless I am  
They cannot take my joy,  
my strength,  
myself  
I am here...  
I AM HERE  
One God, one people,  
I AM HERE  
This transposition can't break me  
I won't let it  
I won't bow down  
I won't kneel  
and so,  
If I die today  
I WILL DIE ON MY FEET!

DEAREST LOVER  
Dearest Lover,  
I watched you sleep last night, corkscrewed delectably below the black rumpled blanket that we shared. Your lips held a delicious subtle smile that touched my core. My thoughts drifted to the kiss we shared just a few hours before sleep had captured you. I could still taste the filling from our apple tart dessert; warm and alluring. I smiled at that thought. Our kisses are always so playful with lip biting with a little nose rubbing incorporated. I love your petite, round nose, always have. I watched your nostrils flare with each breath you took in, in, in. Your eyes rolled under your lids while your lashes kissed your face. I smiled once more thinking of your sweet butterfly kisses that often tickled my lobes. As my face approached yours, I could feel your warmth. I gave you one of my butterfly kisses on your cheek and you scrunched your face and chewed on nothing. I was tempted to wake you, but instead I pulled you closer, allowed my body to become one with your coil, and let your heartbeat become my lullaby.  
Always,  
Your Love

I GOT ME  
Casual craziness  
caresses carefully my frozen heart  
souls shake nonstop like sweet souls  
created to mate...check  
pinned hope is nailed to the cross like Jesus.  
My eyes whisper sadness cause my  
heart knows the truth  
My flashing memory glistens memories of you leaving  
long before you actually did.  
Just another sad love poem.  
Sweat and tears down my face and on my fingertips.  
A full fledged storm is raging.  
A torn letter, a shredded CD is what is left of what our love use to be  
no more happiness is for me  
only everybody around me reads me wrong  
just like the sad love song.  
My shoulders wear shades to hide my sleeves.  
The torn down fence that once protected my heart  
destroyed, irreplaceable.  
So, I spread my arms to the ripping point to hug myself  
because through all the good and bad time  
I'll never let me down.

### PSYCHOTIC BREAK

Dilapidated delusions

Invade my repose

And cloud my sapphire

Dreams with images

Of the unbearably nice.

Patchouli scented

Visions softly pulse

And morph across

The ceiling of my cell

And eventually coagulate

In the corner with

The tickling silver webs.

Those cloying mites

Skitter around, singing

Nonsense, flattering

The dream toward

Demise, while loquacious

Hues ebb and flow

In comforting

Arrhythmia. Begging

My psychosis to

Endure, a battle

Ensues which leaves

My verdant insanity

Wilted and limp,

Fodder for the

Voracious mites.

### MAPLE TREES REMIND ME

Maple trees line

the Roads of my memory,

Leading me, cheering

Me on through the Race.

Cooling the summer

Breeze and coloring

The autumn sky.

Throwing confetti in

Honor of my triumphs.

Challenging my strength

And endurance and

My child's delight in

Gymnastic play.

Reminding me of my

Own roots, knotted or

Smooth.

Maple trees remind me

Of the beauty, peace,

Struggles and play.

Maple trees remind me

Of a home that lies

Within.

### INTO THE RAIN

From a second floor

Window, sheeted with

Rain, a little boy

Peers into the night.

His mother, passed out

On the couch, has

Smoked the food money

And left him to wait

For his angel of mercy.

His father left

Two months ago,

When his mom fell

Apart. The boy

Tip-toes to the door

And slips out into

The rain.

Sitting on the dirty

Stoop, he squints

Into the rain, hoping

For daddy's return

And something to eat.

### ENCHANTED

Within my crimson pool

of silken dreams you

shimmer as heat from

the sand.

Divine explorations and

corporeal expectations

excite the glimmer of

your dance.

Velvet night and blinding

sun meld in a burst of

peace so pure

only a ripple in the sea

of my unconsciousness

could rouse me from

your enchanted dance.

My fingers twitch to

feel the chalky satin

of your impossible beauty.

Precious pain swaddled

in perfect bliss, cradled

to my bosom as a life

moments new.

Longing and savoring,

joyous pain.

### CATHARTIC

### You said it would be cathartic

### But when you walked out the door

### It made my heart turn arctic

### And my blood run cold.

### Jagged ice in my veins

### Piercing the wall you built

### Around my heart

### With your lies, in your guilt.

### When you walked out the door

### I could not understand

### How I would ever go on

### My love in pieces on the floor.

### How did it slip from my hand?

### Watching it lie there

### Gasping for breath,

### I had no choice but to

### Wait and pray for rest.

### Until the morning light dawned

### I waited and dreamt

### Of the day when I would be healed

### And my pain would be spent.

### When you walked out the door

### I could not understand

### How I would ever go on

### My love in pieces on the floor

### You let it slip from your hands.

TASHA

WHITE

Tasha White was born and raised in The Bronx New York area. She is a dedicated mother and works hard to give her child everything that he needs and deserves.

### At an early age Tasha loved music and she wanted to become a singer with her best friend Fiordaliza as a back up singer but, that did not work to well because they both needed money to make tapes and to go on tour.

### Tasha knew that she could make it in the music business but, she also felt that a singing a career is something that you could not rely on. Besides that Fiordaliza also became pregnant with her daughter and after she gave birth she could not just pick up and leave her behind.

### Tasha decided that maybe it was best to obtain a job and since she loves math, she became accountant at Fancy Food Inc. as an Account Manager.

### Tasha really enjoys reading and writing poems and she shares with you three of her latest poems that she wrote.

### BROKEN PROMISES

### You never tell the truth

### You lie through your teeth

### You play a lot of games

### And

### Have broken promises

### You say you love me and will never hurt me

### You told me I was your sunshine

### And

### You will always be mine

### You said I was your day and your night

### But lately all I have is

### Broken Promises

### Why Lie, Why hurt me

### Why smother me with your fake love

### And fake promises

### Only to lie again

### I believed in you

### I trusted you

### I caressed you in my dreams and sleep

### Do you know what that means?

### Why Should I believe you now?

### Because lately all you have been saying and giving me is

### Broken Promises

W H Y

When I sit here

Thinking about all the BS

That has happened to me

Throughout my life

Almost raped, beaten and always hurting inside

Why cry about it

Why shed a single tear

Why get mad about becoming stronger

Why Should I even care

That another man lied again

All that matter is

Me and mines at the end

So I won't ask myself why?

For I have tried and failed

So why ask why?

I gotta keep on with life

But I won't go in life asking why

I became a stronger link

And not the weaker one

So, for those who ask why?

Don't ask why just become

A stronger link

Never a weak link again

Because that weak link just

Became a stronger link

Because I didn't ask the famous question

Why?

L I F E

Life is short at times

Life is hard sometimes

Life is what you make it

Life is the best thing ever

And never a bad thing

Since I had my baby

A boy that is learning about life

A boy that is looking at life in a bigger picture

A boy that brings the smiles in me

And now I live for my son Stephon

For he made me enjoy life

No more crying and shouting

Just laughs and giggles

Thank you God for giving me a son

Because

He is my life
