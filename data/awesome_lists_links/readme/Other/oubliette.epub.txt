SETTINGS

In an Oubliette; In the Doctors' office.

ACT I, SCENE I

An oubliette is the cruelest of prisons. Simply put, it's a hole in the ground. At the top, a locked door where the light shines through. There is no other way out. In such a dismal, bleak predicament, the only way to escape on one's own terms is to learn how to grow wings and fly away.

The stage is one of such prisons; the light is above sight, and the hard, cold floor is on the bottom. On the floor of this prison is PERSEPHONE.

To PERSEPHONE, life is a pain to be thoroughly enjoyed. Only through the gain of torture can SHE truly lose HERSELF.

SHE lies motionless on the ground. Dead or alive, none can tell just yet. Then, the spotlight shines down from above. It is revitalizing; a sacred gift handed down from those on high. PERSEPHONE stirs. SHE looks above, blinded by heaven's favor, and SHE is given an unsullied form of bliss before the light is gone once more.

It's dark again. Time to play.

LOKI enters. A dead smile incarnate, LOKI is the madman's laughter that plays to a one man audience.

*LOKI

A rose can only bloom in the light of the sun. And then it withers. It dies. It rots. And then, more sunlight. More blooms. And then death comes rolling on back. Small deaths. Each one of them sweeter than the last. Tell me, Persephone, how sweet was it this time? Quickly, before you rot all over again.

*PERSEPHONE

Shut up, Loki.

*LOKI

[Laughing] Did you smell it? Did you taste it? Did you hear it? I know what I saw and felt, but you were closer. You stole a spot in the light.

*PERSEPHONE

I won it.

*LOKI

You took it. It wasn't yours. Now, tell me what was so special about this time. Did it make you feel young again? Full of hope and...freedom?

PERSEPHONE hits the ground.

*PERSEPHONE

Leave it alone!

*LOKI

No. Tell me. Tell me what the light did to you this time? How did it make you feel...unstained?

PERSEPHONE starts to chuckle. Then, SHE laughs. LOKI is confused.

*PERSEPHONE

I am stained.

*LOKI

Yes. You are.

*PERSEPHONE

I am torn.

*LOKI

Like paper.

*PERSEPHONE

I am a bleeding heart dripping my tears on skinless faces.

*LOKI

And you are back. Wonderful.

*PERSEPHONE

No one can ever know the darkness that eats my stomach and forces putrid bile out my raw mouth.

*LOKI

And blah, blah-blah-blah. Persephone, don't you ever think of anything new?

PERSEPHONE grabs hold of LOKI.

*PERSEPHONE

Keep stabbing me with your slick tongue, Loki. Make me bleed.

*LOKI

No.

*PERSEPHONE

Make me hurt.

*LOKI

Get off me.

*PERSEPHONE

Lash me with your cruelest of words, your razor eyes—(your needle teeth...)

*LOKI

Leave me alone, bitch!

LOKI pushes away PERSEPHONE, who stays on the ground.

*LOKI

Your flavor has gone. As it always does. As everything does. What wouldn't I give for one...good...victim.

*SET (OS)

If it's a victim you wish for, then you should reconsider how you punish one.

SET enters. Upon a throne built on the top of the highest pyramid, there sits SET looking down upon the world. But only in HIS mind, for now HE's spiritually chained at the ankles and forced to mingle amongst the slaves.

*LOKI

Oh, please. No one tortures like I do. Set, you are out of your element.

*SET

Am I? I've tortured thousands on a whim, just to pass time. I watched their blood splatter upon my rivers, turning veins of blue into crimson.

*LOKI

Really?

*SET

All smashed to pulp beneath my fists. Did I care if I destroyed their dreams? Reduce them to sniveling babies who wine about life? I hurt them, because I could. With my will and will alone. Pain, Loki. Pain is all that matters, when you're the one causing it.

*LOKI

I need an example. Set, will you be the one to give it to me?

*SET

Definitely. Persephone, I'll—(be needing you for a moment...)

LOKI sucker punches SET in the jaw, and SET goes down fast. PERSEPHONE sits straight up, crawling toward the source of more pain. LOKI moves to tower over SET with punches, but SET kicks LOKI away. SET and LOKI wrestle on the ground, and PERSEPHONE touches THEM whenever SHE can.

*PERSEPHONE

Oh please, give me some of this too!

*SET

[to PERSEPHONE] You'll get your turn soon enough!

*LOKI

Oooooh, big words, little king.

SET manages to get the best of LOKI and pins LOKI's arm behind the back.

*SET

Ha, ha! Once again, I prove my superiority.

LOKI laughs, and PERSEPHONE joins HIM. It's obvious to THEM what the true contest was, and SET is completely oblivious to the punch line of this joke.

*SET

What? What is it? I won! I beat him! [to LOKI] I beat you!

*LOKI

At what? Proving your physical superiority? We both know you're the stronger one, stupid.

SET punches LOKI, and LOKI laughs even more.

*LOKI

You...you think the fist is the sharpest tool. Whip the slave and watch him squirm. But you don't own him. His mind is impervious to blunt trauma. Set, little king of mine, the harder you squeeze, the more you lose. And the harder I laugh.

SET releases LOKI.

*SET

But I still beat you physically. At least I have that.

*LOKI

Yes, you do. And I have the memory of bringing royalty down to my peasant level.

This realization hits SET quite personally. HE retracts from LOKI as a nobleman flees from the plague.

*PERSEPHONE

That was wonderful. I am the voyeur to your defeat. If only your pain was mine.

*SET

I won! I won this battle, Loki!

SET exits.

*SET (OS)

I won!

LOKI and PERSEPHONE, still laughing, pull towards EACHOTHER and rest.

*PERSEPHONE

How do you always manage to utterly destroy Set each and every single time?

*LOKI

It's a gift.

The light returns. BOTH are intrigued by this. The light apparently doesn't shine down at this particular time every day.

*LOKI

Share it?

PERSEPHONE nods. THEY crawl over to the light and bask in it. For a moment, THEY seem to be friends. Until YMIR enters.

YMIR is the old mountain that wind and time has reduced to a fraction of its former glory. Angry, forgotten, and without a modicum of honor left, HE attacks like a blind old dog; without reason or care.

PERSEPHONE and LOKI see YMIR and immediately know THEIR time in the sun is over. YMIR growls a warning. PERSEPHONE is enticed as much as SHE is afraid, and LOKI reluctantly moves away from the humorless threat.

*LOKI

You know, Ymir, someday you'll learn how to complete a full sentence. And I'm sure it will be completely by accident.

*YMIR

You hear me? I'll be louder.

YMIR stomps HIS foot on the ground and roars so loud, one would think the walls would cave in any moment. PERSEPHONE puts HER hands over HER ears. LOKI is not impressed.

*YMIR

Go! Go now! You smell weak and afraid, little clown.

*LOKI

Come on, Persephone. You know how Ymir gets when baby doesn't get his bottle.

PERSEPHONE crawls over to YMIR.

*PERSEPHONE

Please. Please show me your true power. Your form is truly a monument of punishment, and its powers are beyond imagination. Give to me. Make me feel your judgment. Crush me like an olive between your teeth; my skin grinding down to give way to its bitter juices within. Please. Please!

YMIR has had enough. HE pulls PERSEPHONE away from HIS feet and tosses HER towards LOKI. Without another word, YMIR walks into the light and is instantly enthralled by it. This was the warm bath of bliss HE had been needing, and finally the juggernaut is at peace. PERSEPHONE holds HER wounds with delight, but saddens when SHE sees YMIR is no longer in the mood to administer pain. SHE looks up to LOKI.

*LOKI

I told you to leave when you had your chance. Now you're too excited. Your poor little heart is throbbing, throbbing with blood, but no release will come.

*PERSEPHONE

I know. I'll find someone else.

THEY exit. YMIR is left alone in HIS light shower.

CAIN enters, exhausted from troublesome thoughts and the strain of hating so much. CAIN is man's cry against the dark and all that dwells within. For all those who impose, who control, who confine, who destroy, CAIN is the primordial "NO" shouted through bloodstained teeth.

CAIN doesn't even notice the light or YMIR standing in it. HE cares or feels very little right now.

*CAIN

Hopeless. [Laughs a little.] Or not. I don't know, and I don't care anymore. Now comes sleep. Sleep in my eyes. Sleep in my brain. Sleep.

CAIN lies down. VENUS enters, looking down on CAIN with a cruel smile. VENUS burns in all of us; an endless thirst for our own destructive passions and whatever may come of them. IF chaos was to take material form, SHE'd definitely be the heart and womb all in one.

VENUS bends down to stroke CAIN's head.

*VENUS

Drooping eye, do not sleep just yet. You have more to feel, little Cain. [Beat.] Cain.

*CAIN

Hmm?

*VENUS

Pretty, little Cain.

*CAIN

What? Venus? Venus. Yes, it would be the pain in my loins that'd keep me from sleep. Yes, yes, yes. It's funny. And too painful.

*VENUS

The heretic in your head has finished for now, but the harlot in your belly has had not one word spoken yet. Let her rant and rave. I'm listening with burning ears and wish for my fill of profanities.

*CAIN

You can profane yourself, for all I care. Wait. No, I care more than that. A stirring below has started, and now I must sate my desires.

VENUS helps CAIN up.

*VENUS

Slave of mine, beast of burden, you will plow the lush fields, whether you wish it or no.

CAIN pushes VENUS away.

*CAIN

No! I will not. I serve you not one offering.

CAIN grabs hold of VENUS.

*CAIN

I will take you. Take you as 'I' wish. Not you. You caused this pain of mine, and it will be you to be martyred by it.

CAIN forcefully kisses VENUS's neck, and SHE delights in it.

*VENUS

Oh, my obstinate child, feed me your rage.

*YMIR

NO...MORE...NOISE!

VENUS and CAIN stop. CAIN's rage has now locked on a new target, and VENUS realizes and fears the switch in favor.

*CAIN

You.

*VENUS

Cain, don't.

*CAIN

Ymir, the unbroken beast.

*VENUS

Look at me.

*CAIN

The unclimbed mountain.

*VENUS

Give me all your desires.

*CAIN

You stupid, selfish, single-focused animal.

VENUS slaps CAIN. HE does not respond.

*CAIN

Muscles on muscles, but hardly any brain. You're a giant child, and when I beat you like the father you never had, you'll learn what you are. I will not let you oppose your will on me any longer! You hear me, Ymir?! Ymir!

YMIR breaks away from the light.

*YMIR

You smell tiny and milky. A child.

YMIR laughs hard. Behind CAIN, VENUS cannot contain HER laughter either. CAIN moves HIS rage back and forth between the two. HE can't tell who HE's angry at the most.

*VENUS

Look, look. The dog with two bones.

CAIN decides who HE's angry at the most. CAIN punches YMIR. YMIR rubs HIS jaw. CAIN stands defiantly.

*YMIR

You...are soft.

YMIR goes into full attack mode and wrestles with CAIN, who attacks as ferociously and as blindly as a rabid dog. It's effective in at least causing YMIR some troubles in pinning CAIN. THE two roll around on the ground, exchanging punches whenever a free arm allows it. VENUS gasps with pleasure each time YMIR lands a blow on CAIN.

*VENUS

Yes, Ymir, yes! Destroy the petulant child. Become the ironfisted father. Dominate him!

YMIR finally gets CAIN completely pinned down to the ground. No escape. But CAIN still does not give up.

*YMIR

You lost. The red in your face makes you look foolish. Give up.

CAIN keeps trying to wiggle out of the trap.

*YMIR

Give up!

CAIN yells at the top of his lungs and wiggles HIS body like a cockroach half crushed by the boot. YMIR lets go of CAIN.

*YMIR

Fool. I am done with you.

YMIR goes back to HIS light. The weakened CAIN lies on the ground. VENUS is enthralled by YMIR, but SHE gives HER respects to the defeated. SHE kneels down to pat CAIN.

*VENUS

There, there little—(Cain...)

*CAIN

Off me, bitch!

CAIN stands and feels the pain all over HIS body.

*VENUS

[Smiling.] Your arrow in my heart stabs me deeply.

*CAIN

A used up and sickly prostitute can only fake a lover's pain. Don't use yourself as a bargaining chip, Venus. I'm not buying. [to YMIR] And you, take comfort in today. Tomorrow's day is mine, and you will fall under my fist and wrath, Ymir. This is NOT OVER!

CAIN exits.

VENUS, having lost her toy, views YMIR with keen interest.

*VENUS

The immovable rock turns away yet another defeated mortal. Blow after blow they deal you, yet not a scratch is left. No crevice deepened. No stone turned over. You remain as you were; the perfect monolith of nature. But even stone can soak up the rain. It thirsts. It yearns. It prays for heavenly fluid to fall upon it just once more. And only after it is swallowed up by the seas, only then is it satisfied. Engulfed. Engorged by pleasure.

YMIR huffs.

*VENUS

I think you know I'm right.

VENUS moves to touch YMIR's jaw, but YMIR quickly grabs HER arm. He throws VENUS' hand away, moves in close, and then practically forces HER to fall as HE roars at HER.

*YMIR

Go! Now!

YMIR returns to the light. VENUS is a little heartbroken by this. VENUS exits.

Beat.

TIAMAT clicks HER tongue Offstage. YMIR is instantly pulled out of bliss and into full panic mode. HE swings back and forth, HIS vision trying to lock in on the source of the insectile battlecry. TIAMAT clicks HER tongue again.

Confused and nervous, YMIR stomps on the ground.

*YMIR

Tiamat, come! Darkness hides you, but you smell of fear. Cowards strike from shadows. Be a warrior. Fight me.

TIAMAT enters slowly, one soft-landing foot after another. Single-minded, cold, pure adrenalin, this is the perfect predator. There are few things that give pleasure even close to that of unrestrained slaughter, and TIAMAT was born from that sinful hole.

TIAMAT circles YMIR, never releasing HER eyes from HIS. This creature is the one undefeatable foe, and YMIR, a towering bully, knows it.

*YMIR

Are you ready?

*TIAMAT

The oak is mighty.

A wild wind breaks its trunk.

It is now knee high.

YMIR yells at TIAMAT, who hisses and clicks in return.

*YMIR

I am mighty. I am hard. I am warrior!

YMIR raises arm and swings with a heavy thrust, which TIAMAT dodges with hardly any effort. YMIR turns around like a topsy, spinning top. When HE faces TIAMIAT, SHE strikes like lightning at YMIR's throat. Immediately, HE drops down to HIS knees, gasping for air. Satisfied with the ease of HER strike, SHE observes HER prey closely without an ounce of fear.

*YMIR

[Coughing] I...will...kill...you.

*TIAMAT

Statue of combat,

It lies in pieces on dirt.

No one remembers.

YMIR pushes through the swollen throat and rises for combat. TIAMAT, the greedy snake SHE is, prepares for another humiliating strike. YMIR hits HIS arms and chest as HE growls with pure, unrestricted fury. HE belts out HIS warcry, and TIAMAT replies with HER forked hiss.

Before the blows are exchanged, an alarm sounds.

SFX: A more elegant alarm; not rough, but more white room.

YMIR and TIAMAT are immediately panicked. They don't dare to move a muscle.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Subject Ymir, you have been selected for analysis. Do not fight the process, and this will all be over very soon. Thank you for cooperating.

SFX: A rising high pitched ringing.

TIAMAT runs out of the room like torn paper in a hurricane. YMIR, having been selected, knows that disobeying brings on a much worse fate than complying. HE stands upright and rigid; a martyr to his own bravery.

The lights rise up to full, almost blindingly so. Then, BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE I

ACT I, SCENE II

A clean and respectably sterile room. YMIR is bound to a chair in the middle of the room and sleeping. A table is before him with two chairs resting under the right and left edges.

YMIR slowly comes to. HE finds HIS arms and legs bound. This troubles HIM. HE tests the chair's strength, pulling at first, and then by jagged contortions. The chair remains stable.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

*COMPUTER (OV)

Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Please be complacent as our doctors enter to examine you. Thank you for cooperating.

PROMETHEUS and KALI enter with notepads in hand.

PROMETHEUS is a kindhearted, gentle individual capable of much compassion. Forever the healer, there is not one microbe of ill will within HIS being.

KALI, a soldier of rules and restrictions, is a healer second and a dictator first. Though HER intentions are good, they are riddled with a desire for control.

PROMETHEUS and KALI sit down across from EACHOTHER, and then look to THEIR notes.

*PROMETHEUS

Hello, Ymir. [to KALI] Dr. Kali, shall we begin?

*KALI

Yes.

*PROMETHEUS

[to YMIR] I'm not really seeing any improvement. If you recall from our last session, I remember asking you to try some calming exercises that would have helped with your anger issues. From my observations, you've completely disregarded my advice. Now, I know it's not your intention to be self-destructive, but you certainly are headed down that path. It troubles me to see you in pain, especially when you're the one causing it.

*KALI

You've been hostile multiple times this month. More than you've been in the past. I believe you're doing it on purpose. To spite us.

*PROMETHEUS

Is that true, Ymir? Are you still trying to revolt against us?

*YMIR

[to KALI] Kali...--

*KALI

Na-ah-ah. Doctor Kali.

YMIR groans.

*PROMETHEUS

You can call me only Prometheus if you like.

*YMIR

I am...a warrior. I hear winds call for my wrath. I follow my nature.

*KALI

But you are not a warrior anymore, are you?

*YMIR

I am warrior!

*PROMETHEUS

Please, please calm down. We're only asking questions.

*KALI

Or at least you failed as one. That's why you're here, isn't it?

*YMIR

I am a prisoner of war.

*PROMETHEUS

No. Certainly not. You're here as our patient, who has some issues, and needs help fixing them.

*KALI

Ymir, why do you fight with the other patients? Like Tiamat.

YMIR tries to stand up.

*YMIR

I will kill her! She will feed me with her warm blood when I am through with her.

*KALI

You haven't yet. Why? Why haven't you?

*PROMETHEUS

Let's change the subject for the time being, yes? Okay. Ymir, why have you been taking more than your allotted time of the sunlight?

*YMIR

I...I like the light.

*PROMETHEUS

Good. That's good.

*KALI

What isn't good is you're stealing that light from the others. You're not the only one down there. They need their light too. Don't you think so?

*YMIR

I don't care. The light is mine. I took it, and I kept it. I deserve it.

*KALI

You don't deserve anything we don't give you.

YMIR huffs.

*KALI

Stop that. You're a patient, but in your own words, you're a prisoner of war.

*PROMETHEUS

It isn't--(really a fair view--)

*KALI

And as such, you have no rights. No rewards for brutality. No rights to anything. Not you or your fellow soldiers. We own you. You are ours.

YMIR slumps down in HIS chair.

*PROMETHEUS

But that doesn't have to be the way it is. You can change that. Better yourself. Become a better "you" that we can all appreciate. What do you say to that?

Beat.

PROMETHEUS writes down on HIS notepad.

*PROMETHEUS

I'm suggesting that you start experimenting with some low-stress exercises to expend some of that natural anger that builds up within you. Perhaps that'll allow you enough clarity to see our point of view. Dr. Kali, anything to add?

*KALI

Ymir, you are suspended from the light for a week.

It hits YMIR by surprise, and then HE pulls at HIS bonds out of desperation.

*KALI

You took more than your fair share, and we've been too easy on you. One week, no light. Or else we start punishments again. You remember the punishments, don't you?

YMIR gives up the struggle physically, but mentally HE's running in circles.

*KALI

That's what I thought. One week. No exceptions. Am I making myself clear?

Half-beat.

*KALI

Ymir, am I making myself clear?

*YMIR

Yes!

*KALI

Good. Dr. Prometheus, we're done here.

*PROMETHEUS

[to YMIR] I hope our next meeting will be on better terms. Goodbye.

PROMETHEUS and KALI exit the room.

*YMIR

I am prisoner. I am nothing.

BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE II

ACT I, SCENE III

In the oubliette. There is no light shinning down, but YMIR is sitting down far away from its usual spotlight touchdown. HE is broken...for the moment.

PERSEPHONE enters. SHE sees YMIR wallowing in sorrow, and SHE almost hops for joy.

*PERSEPHONE

So broken. So torn asunder. Like me.

PERSEPHONE sits down next to YMIR.

*PERSEPHONE

I am your shadow. Darker than you, but nothing without you. When your form is wounded, so is mine. I bleed out of your wounds, gushing rivers and soaking the earth with our warm tears. How can we be who we are without our torment? It paints us black. Our ivory insides know no better. We are in love.

PERSEPHONE snuggles against the still unmoving YMIR.

VENUS enters. SHE sees PERSEPHONE, laughs, and then lies down where the light will shine down.

*PERSEPHONE

What?

*VENUS

Does a disciple ever tire of worshiping in a fallen temple?

*PERSEPHONE

But that's where worship is needed the most. Does a surgeon operate on perfect health, or does he heal the wound? No, I will nurse my muse back to health or join him in his grave.

*VENUS

Yes, I'm sure you will, Persephone. Or...

*PERSEPHONE

Or what?

*VENUS

The servant can serve herself and lie down with me.

*PERSEPHONE

I don't think I want that.

*VENUS

Not to rub fingertips. Join this corpse in her hole and wait for the light of day to reveal our inner selves.

*PERSEPHONE

I...he needs me.

*VENUS

I need you.

PERSEPHONE breaks and crawls over to VENUS.

*PERSEPHONE

To suffer on cold and wait forever for the warmth?

*VENUS

My misery wants your company.

PERSEPHONE lies down next to VENUS.

*PERSEPHONE

Tell me how you feel?

*VENUS

I feel? The toucher wants to touch. Not to be touched. Tell me how you feel.

*PERSEPHONE

I feel the same as I always do.

*VENUS

What wonderful company you make.

CAIN enters. The tension in the room immediately jumps up five levels. CAIN gives YMIR the evil eye. YMIR, stagnant until now, sees CAIN and stands. YMIR doesn't want to fight, but HE will not allow CAIN to pummel HIM unchallenged. PERSEPHONE doesn't know what to do, and VENUS doesn't pay attention. Eventually, CAIN sits off to a far corner, away from YMIR. YMIR sits back down and returns to inner solitude...with PERSEPHONE as HIS unnoticed companion.

*VENUS

Fine. Keep the silent veteran by your side. More light for me.

Enter SET. HE walks over to VENUS and towers over HER.

*VENUS

Yes?

*SET

Move.

*VENUS

How so?

*SET

Away.

*VENUS

Why?

*SET

Because I said so. Now move.

*VENUS

No. You have nothing over me. Your muscles might overpower, but your words mean nothing to me. Besides, it's mine turn in the light.

*SET

You're right. Only actions mean something to you. A slave doesn't build faster when you whip them harder. They move faster when you take something away: water, their hut, a child. So, what can I take away from you?

*VENUS

Ha! None of us have anything down here. Only time and each other.

*SET

Hmm. That's a good point. I'll take away both from you.

*VENUS

You're going to free me from here? Don't get my hopes so strongly up, you king on high.

*SET

Me.

*VENUS

You?

*SET

I take away me. Venus, you're nothing without someone else, and my presence is an invaluable treasure to you. As it should be. I'm leaving now.

SET begins to move away from VENUS.

*VENUS

You're leaving me Set?

*SET

I will not lie with you later either. It is my choice to bathe in your ruby rivers, no matter how dry I might be. But you? [chuckles] You're nothing without me. Without anyone, for that matter, but especially without me. Now, what say you? Move, or no?

Hurt from earlier denial, VENUS acquiesces and moves over towards CAIN. SHE doesn't fawn over HIM as PERSEPHONE does to YMIR, but more so sits by an acquaintance. SET has to laugh at this.

*SET

What a choice.

*VENUS

The better of three.

*SET

Is it? Cain, a rebellious child whom I wouldn't even send my best troops to slaughter. Ymir, a blind alligator snapping at anything. Or Persephone, the broken mourner?

*PERSEPHONE

Leave us alone! You have your light. Leave us in peace.

*SET

Why? I have a royal appetite. And I want it all.

CAIN stands.

*CAIN

You won't get it.

*SET

Oh? Going to keep it from me?

*CAIN

I don't have to. There's nothing here for you to take.

*SET

Your will, your body, your voice-(your sense of purpose--)

*CAIN

Nothing material. No gold, no kingdoms, no servants.

*SET

That has yet to be seen.

Beat.

*CAIN

I will never serve you.

*SET

As I said before, that has yet to be seen.

CAIN moves to attack, but VENUS stops him.

*VENUS

No. Let him have his moment. Let the bull grow fat and prideful, before the sacrifice. Before we all together feed on the self-righteous cow when he least expects it.

*SET

Whore.

*VENUS

Fool.

CAIN sits back down. SET laughs and walks over to YMIR.

*SET

It's sad. You thought you were our king. But they threw you down. Broke your pride. Broke you. Now, you can't even allow yourself to take a little sunshine.

YMIR growls and stands upright. YMIR and SET stare each other down. PERSEPHONE stands as well.

*PERSEPHONE

No, no, no, no. Stay down with me. Suffer in silence. Don't give in to it.

The light from above shines down. ALL look up at the glorious gift. SET laughs and steps into the spotlight, tempting YMIR.

*SET

It's great. I almost feel powerful again. More powerful than any of you. Especially you, Ymir.

YMIR moves towards SET.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Attention, attention. Subject Ymir, you are not allowed to stand in the light. Further disobedience will result in punishment.

YMIR takes a step back. Another. Another. Another.

*SET

You trained lion. You coward! I am the brave one. I am the only warrior here. I deserve the fruit of the sacred tree. And they know it, too. I am the king. Bow down, slaves.

SFX: A more elegant alarm; not rough, but more white room.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Subject Set, you have been selected for analysis. Do not fight the process, and this will all be over very soon. Thank you for cooperating.

ALL except SET leave.

SFX: A high-pitched, ringing.

*SET

You see?! They know I'm chosen. Don't leave now. Won't you stay for my crowning event? Not even you, Cain? Don't you want to see the true form of a king?

The lights rise up, almost blindingly so. Then, BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE III

ACT I, SCENE IV

The same sterile room as before, along with chairs and table. This time is different. SET is not bound to the chair as YMIR was. In fact, he doesn't move from the chair, being that a spotlight similar in the oubliette is shinning down on HIM right now. HE is enjoying the bliss with a clean smile on HIS face.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

PROMETHEUS and KALI enter with notepads. THEY observe SET's behavior, writing down the details.

*PROMETHEUS

He seems to be increasingly enjoying the presence of unfiltered light.

*KALI

Just like the rest. Confined in darkness, they've associated all their positive qualities and experiences to the light. They're easier to control now.

*PROMETHEUS

Control?

*KALI

How else do you think we'll heal them? Without control, they'll never get better.

*PROMETHEUS

That's debatable. I--(don't necessarily merit--)

*KALI

Not in front of the patient.

*PROMETHEUS

Of course not. I apologize for being unprofessional.

*KALI

[to SET] What would you say you're experiencing right now?

*SET

Warmth...Joy...Power.

*PROMETHEUS

Power? How so?

*SET

You don't understand.

*KALI

Then tell us.

*SET

[laughing] How to explain to the dung beetle that his ball of shit is inferior to the sun?

*KALI

Are you insulting us?

*SET

No. Seeing the truth is all.

*PROMETHEUS

Could you try to explain it to us? Dr. Kali and I would greatly appreciate it.

*SET

Well...I can try.

*PROMETHEUS

Thank you for your efforts.

*SET

I have the light. They do not. You do not. I do. I am the light. You are the darkness. You're weak. You're dying. I'm forever. I am the light.

*KALI

I control the light. It turns off and on when I say so. Doesn't that put me above you?

*SET

But you haven't turned it off. Upon my temples, the heavens showered their gifts upon me. I deserved it all and more. And those below me deserved nothing.

*PROMETHEUS

[to KALI] Perhaps we should turn it off. We might witness a more productive reaction than this.

*KALI

No. [to SET] And when we leave you in the shadows. What then? What are you then?

Beat.

*KALI

Set, what are you then?

Half-beat.

*SET

Waiting.

SET laughs.

*PROMETHEUS

[to KALI] I have an interesting idea. May I pursue it?

KALI sarcastically holds out HER hand as reply.

*PROMETHEUS

Thank you. [to SET] Set? Set, please pay attention. I have a proposition to present to you. Will you allow me to ask you it?

*SET

I allow it, Dr. Prometheus.

*PROMETHEUS

Prometheus is just fine. Now, Dr. Kali has just told you that we control the light. What if we could increase the light source?

*SET

I can always use more gold.

*PROMETHEUS

And allow it to become so bright that all of the other patients might also enjoy being in the light. What would you say to that?

For the first time, SET is actually less than blissful in the light. This question is quite perplexing; the notion of generosity to a greedy tyrant.

*SET

And receive less light for myself?

*PROMETHEUS

No. The same amount. And the same amount for everyone else.

*KALI

Defeats the purpose of nocturnal confinement, doesn't it?

*PROMETHEUS

Yes, it does. [to SET] What is your opinion? Would you want this to happen?

Beat.

*SET

No.

KALI shakes HER head and writes some information down.

*PROMETHEUS

Mind if I ask why?

*SET

The pyramid rises to a point. It shows the world who is its master. For all to be on top, enjoying what I enjoy, it makes ruling meaningless. I will not become a lesser being.

*PROMETHEUS

Even if it means your companions will no longer suffer?

*SET

Why would I ever want that?

SET laughs, and then goes back to enjoying the light.

*KALI

Satisfied?

*PROMETHEUS

Not particularly, but I did receive an answer.

*KALI

What now? Should we test this communist idea of yours? Give the keys to the prisoners, so to speak?

*PROMETHEUS

No. Not yet.

*KALI

Yet? Never.

*PROMETHEUS

Has it occurred to you that by showing some generosity, they might learn the habit?

*KALI

That's debatable.

*PROMETHEUS

Then perhaps we should debate it. Or rather, talk calmly about it with each other.

*KALI

Look at him. A relic from an ancient world filled with death and war. He can't know what generosity means. Not until we break him of everything he knows. A clean slate. Then, after that, I'll be happy to show some generosity.

*PROMETHEUS

You should have more faith in them, Dr. Kali. They'd surprise you, I'm sure.

*KALI

And I'm sure they wouldn't. I'm done for the day. You have anything more to do here?

*PROMETHEUS

I don't. [to SET] Set, I'm sorry, but we must return you now. However, we can't return you as you were. You need to learn how to rely on others and see them as your equals.

*SET

Never.

*PROMETHEUS

So, your arms will be bound in a manner that will not allow you to do basic tasks on your own. You will have to rely on the generosity of your fellow patients. You will have to make friends.

*SET

Allies?

*KALI

No. Friends. If you can't, then the next few days will be tormenting. If you're smart, you'll ask for help and show appreciation for whatever you get.

*SET

Never. I have no equals. I...am...on...top. Royalty. Not a servant. Not a merchant. Not a doctor. King. You and they will know this soon. I swear it.

*KALI

[to PROMETHEUS] I wonder how this will turn out.

KALI and PROMETHEUS leave. SET still enjoys the light as the stage goes to BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE IV

ACT I, SCENE V

The oubliette. SET is sitting down far away from where the light would shine down. HIS arms are bound, HIS mood has soured, and there's an annoying malady sitting beside HIM called PERSEPHONE.

*PERSEPHONE

Together, we will suffer as we should. In this pit of dreary solitude, we shall know ourselves. Our tears will grow cold on our cheeks, our eyes blurry from staring into the void, our--(skin will wither into nothing--)

*SET

Shut up. I don't favor you. You are very, very beneath me. Go away.

*PERSEPHONE

You only make me aware of how special this moment is for me.

PERSEPHONE snuggles with the annoyed SET.

Enter CAIN and LOKI. CAIN is holding a deck of cards, and LOKI is carrying a small sack.

*LOKI

So what's the game?

*CAIN

You pick it. I don't care how I beat you.

*LOKI

Big words. Let's see if you can stand behind them...and not stab them in the back, that is.

*CAIN

Between the two of us, who is known for their deceit and treachery?

*LOKI

I am. Because I'm better at it than you. Just like any card game we might play. I suggest we play We Are Legion.

*CAIN

No. You abuse the rules. I like playing Ravana's Folly.

*LOKI

You would. We might as well be playing "who has the highest card"!

Half-beat.

*CAIN

Seven Spentas.

*LOKI

No. Too predictable.

*SET

If you're wanting a true challenge, you can play Dragon's Teeth. It takes intelligence, cunning, and a desire for cruelty. All which I excel at.

*LOKI

I like it. Problem: We need four players.

*CAIN

We have four now.

*LOKI

Look at them. He has no hands, and she's...do I have to say it?

*SET

I never asked to play. I only suggested the game so you'd silence your holes in my presence.

*CAIN

You're playing.

*SET

Don't you pretend--(you have any power--)

*CAIN

You're playing! Or else I'll find some entertainment in beating an armless foe.

*PERSEPHONE

Ravage us! Ravage us, please! Rip us asunder, flay open our clamy skin, bash our heads in! Anything to push us off the edge of our teetering sanity--(and help us realize--)

*SET

I'll play! I will play.

*LOKI

How? With your lower hands?

*CAIN

She can help.

*PERSEPHONE

I can. I can do that.

*LOKI

Good. Let's play a game of Dragon's Teeth.

ALL form a 3/4 circle on the ground. CAIN shuffles the deck, LOKI empties the bag of wooden nickels on the ground, and PERSEPHONE buddies up closely to the tormented SET.

*CAIN

Ready?

CAIN starts to hand out the cards.

*PERSEPHONE

I can't play.

*CAIN

What?

*PERSEPHONE

I'm helping my companion.

*CAIN

We need four players.

*LOKI

Couldn't have told us this before, Persephone?

*PERSEPHONE

I...I've always been helpless. And now I'm that and also helping the helpless.

*CAIN

We have three players. Not enough for this game.

*SET

I won't play another.

*CAIN

Then give a solution or consent to sit yourself back with the sycophant.

*LOKI

[to OFFSTAGE] Venus! Oh, lover girl, please show your ruby lips to this wanting crowd. And your face too if willing.

*CAIN

The whore?

*LOKI

The whore, the brute, or the monster. You pick better.

VENUS enters.

*VENUS

A crowd? Such deviants.

*CAIN

Play a game with us.

*VENUS

Every moment I can.

*CAIN

A 'card' game.

*VENUS

What are the stakes?

*LOKI

The usual. Turns taken in the light.

*VENUS

Can I play for sensual favors instead?

*CAIN, LOKI, SET

No!

*SET

The game is Dragon's Teeth. We need a fourth. Sit down and play the game.

*VENUS

Fine. Deal me in.

VENUS sits down. CAIN passes four cards to each player, LOKI divides the wooden nickels equally, PERSEPHONE holds up the cards for SET.

Dragon's Teeth: Each player receives four cards. A single card (King Leonidus) is placed in the middle of the players. The object of the game is to achieve a score of fifty without going over a single point ("Legend"). During a players' turn, they have the option of putting as many cards down on the table in front of them as they want, and then draw that many cards. Their score is a total of what is down in front of them plus the center card. If their total ever goes over fifty, then they discard all of their cards on the table and start over. At the end of each turn, the player can opt to discard a card from their hand and change the center card ("Cadmus throws the stone; Long live King Leonidus"). This tactic is used to "bust" other player's totals. If more than one player results in a total of fifty, then all lose.

*CAIN

Dealer goes first.

THEY play the game.

*VENUS

So, this is...interesing. Tantilizing. And outright orgasmic. [Half-beat.] This is boring. Let's talk.

*PERSEPHONE

About what?

*LOKI

Let me guess. Sex?

*VENUS

Not everything entertaining is physical, Loki. You should know that well.

*LOKI

Oh, really? Then why don't you pick the topic of debate for us?

*VENUS

Gladly. How about...What point in your existence was your happiest moment ever?

*LOKI

Told you she'd pick sex. [to CAIN] Give me three.

*VENUS

If that's what's on your mind, you low-breed mare in heat, then that's what you should share.

*SET

[to VENUS] You go first.

*VENUS

Fair. It was the first time I made love.

LOKI stares blankly at the OTHERS.

*VENUS

Not sex. Love. It's quite different.

*SET

Who was it with?

*VENUS

With the most elegant, silver-tongued, witty, lean, sweaty, virile, nimble-fingered...It was Hermes. He was a rebel. No one could touch him, or catch him in a trap. Not even Zeus. He'd play trick up on trick upon trick, and each time he'd find a way to better everyone in the end. One night, he found his way into my bed chambers. My guards he poisoned with a sleep potion, and his footsteps were so soft as to not wake the others on the mountain. He thought himself so clever. He undressed, swam his way underneath the covers, and when his face reached mine, he saw I was awake.

*CAIN

He was going to rape you?

*VENUS

Don't be so crude. It was so beautiful. He touched me. I touched him. I thought I could vanquish him quickly, but he evaded me every time. I wish I was there right now.

*LOKI

So do I.

*SET

Didn't your coupling create a defective child?

*VENUS

Hermaphroditus is not defective. He's the result of pure satisfaction and love.

*CAIN

A product of rape.

TIAMAT slowly enters, unseen.

*VENUS

That's my story. How about you? Any of you?

Beat.

*CAIN

For me, it was the...

CAIN sees TIAMAT.

*PERSEPHONE

What? What is..?

PESEPHONE sees TIAMAT, and when SHE does, ALL do.

*LOKI

She won't attack all of us. Not all at once.

*PERSEPHONE

Are you sure? She's right there. I feel my heart throbbing so hard, revealing my vulnerabilities to an inhuman deviant.

*SET

If she attacks, I will defend. And they will support my actions.

*LOKI

You hope we do, handless. If she attacks you and only you, you might find yourself with only you to defend yourself. Whose hand is it?

*PERSEPHONE

It's mine. It's ours.

*LOKI

Then go.

TIAMAT slowly crawls around the group, still far away.

*CAIN

It was the first harvest.

*PERSEPHONE

Hmm?

*CAIN

My first harvest of the seasons. With my brother Abel. We were so proud. My brother, younger than I by a year, had taken to the beasts of the land. He learned their ways, studied their minds, and herded them. While I, a tiller of the land, studied the green life. I saw how they spawned forth from the soil, bloomed their breeding colors, and withered in the absence of water or sun. Together, we brought forth a wondrous bounty. No one could have done any better. We were equals. The best.

*VENUS

How...quaint. It sounds nice.

*LOKI

Tell her what happened next.

*PERSEPHONE

What happened next, Cain?

*CAIN

We brought our bounty to our lord, he favored Abel's and cursed mine, I killed my brother, and then I was cast out of my homeland.

*SET

My favorite part of the story. [to PERSEPHONE] Don't put that card down. The next one. The next one.

*VENUS

Well. That was certainly--(more than I asked--)

TIAMAT attacks PERSEPHONE, pulling HER away from the group. PERSEPHONE screams from the pain, and LOKI, CAIN, and VENUS come to HER aid. SET continues to sit still and do nothing. TIAMAT pulls at PERSEPHONE, while LOKI and VENUS pull at the other end and CAIN holding TIAMAT in a choke hold.

*PERSEPHONE

She's ripping me apart!

*LOKI

[to CAIN] Don't you think you can put a little more arm strength into it, kinslayer?

*CAIN

Shut up, Loki!

*VENUS

Pull harder!

LOKI lets go of PERSEPHONE and jumps on TIAMAT, pummeling HER sides with a iron fist. TIAMAT screeches at the top of HER lungs just before letting go of PERSEPHONE. The loss of tension throws LOKI and CAIN off, TIAMAT hisses at the two, and then SHE scurries off. CAIN makes to run for TIAMAT, but LOKI holds HIM back.

*LOKI

No! We barely overcame her in the light. Do you think we'll do any better in total darkness?

*CAIN

You're a coward!

*LOKI

No. Just smart. One day, if you eat your vegetables, you might be too. Come on. We have a game to finish.

PERSEPHONE is crying in VENUS' lap.

*PERSEPHONE

Why? Why did she chose me to violate? And why did she fail to finish me off? Why leave me wounded and not finish the kill? Am I so destined to never find a fitting end?

*VENUS

Hush, little one. Find your heart in my lap, and keep your wet cheeks warm against my flesh.

CAIN stares down at SET.

*SET

She didn't attack me.

*CAIN

I should rip your head off and chew on your sinews.

*SET

Another day. Right now, I'm winning a card game. Sit down.

CAIN grabs SET's neck. SET does nothing to defend HIMSELF.

*LOKI

Come on, Cain. Are you really going to be known for beating a handicapped, arrogant ass? He might act like a snake, but without arms, he's a martyr.

CAIN lets go and sits back down.

*SET

There, there--(my little--)

*LOKI

Don't! I don't want to have to save you a second time.

ALL play cards.

*LOKI

Well I guess it's my turn. My best day...hmm. My best day...hmm. My best day would have to be....the day my blood-brother Odin accepted me into his family.

*VENUS

How absurd. You loved the warm embrace of that gaping maw for a family?

*LOKI

Yes. I did. As horrible as the outcome was, I still cherish the fuzzy feeling of being included in a family. Seeing as how torn apart and hideous my own family was before Odin's get destroyed them, it was a treat to be part of one that cared for all its members. [To CAIN] Three.

*VENUS

I never understood why he didn't rip the roots of the weed right out of the ground, and instead planted you in his rose bed.

*SET

I know.

*CAIN

No you don't.

*SET

Loki was alone. Without allies. And he's a great warrior.

*LOKI

Thank you.

*SET

Why waste a desperate ally for a few seconds of happiness. [To ALL] I throw the stone at the king.

*ALL [except SET]

Long live Lionidus.

VENUS takes HER cards and puts them in the discard pile.

*VENUS

To the crows with you, Set. To the bloodthirsty, worm-eating crows.

*SET

[Chuckling] I said I was the best at this game.

*PERSEPHONE

That must have been nice. Being a part of a whole that loathed the foreigner. So much hatred mixed amongst love. It's too perfect.

*LOKI

Yes. You could say that. It was so damn perfect, I had to end it by killing Odin's favorite kinsman.

*CAIN

Did this victim cause you grief? Did he sin against you?

*LOKI

No. He never sinned. That's why I chose him for a trick. One of my worst.

Beat.

*SET

It's my turn to tell a story. [To LOKI] You were finished? Yes?

*LOKI

I am now.

*PERSEPHONE

On with your story, Set. Ravish me with your happiness soured.

*VENUS

Go on, Set. Your time to shine with glory is upon you. Woo your audience, Sand King.

*SET

Mine was the day I killed my brother.

*CAIN

You were happy to kill your own blood?

*SET

Yes. I am not a simple-minded farmer, Cain. I am royalty. My bloodline is the purest, and I the purest of them all. Those who share my lineage are my sworn enemies. My brother was my greatest.

*LOKI

Osiris? I thought his kid would be your greatest, since he was the one who overthrew you.

*SET

[Laughing] No. That foolish child is nothing to me. He will never be as perfect as I am.

*CAIN

He avenged his father. You were defeated. He is the greater one. You are his inferior.

Beat.

*VENUS

Tell me how the warmth of your brother's ichor felt on your hands.

*SET

Like...a holy bath. His blood cleansed me of my flaws, my inhibitions, and my moral weaknesses.

*VENUS

Like you ever had morals. Silly. [To CAIN] One, please.

*SET

I know. It seems like an eternity ago. It was...I can't describe it. His death was my rebirth.

Beat.

*LOKI

No one's going to ask her, are we?

*SET, VENUS, CAIN

No.

*PERSEPHONE

I know my happiest moment in life.

*LOKI

It happened anyway.

*PERSEPHONE

It's now. With all of you.

*LOKI, SET, VENUS, CAIN

[Not in unison] No, no, no, no, no.

*LOKI

You can't pick now.

*PERSEPHONE

Why not?

*CAIN

It's against the rules.

*VENUS

Persephone, dear, a songbird is not a songbird when it crows like a cock.

*PERSEPHONE

But I'm telling the truth. Denied the pleasures of life? Forced to bond with the unbondable? Given only the smallest of sustenance to keep us from falling into darkness? Isn't that the saddest and truest form happiness one could ever hope to find?

*LOKI

No, you stupid cow.

*CAIN

Pick something else.

*PERSEPHONE

Then...my marriage to my uncle, granted by father.

LOKI carefully hides one of his cards.

*LOKI

Three, please.

CAIN hands LOKI three.

*PERSEPHONE

It was a wedding to cry one's eyes drier than a desert. The brimstone burned my nostrils, my maids were cutting off their hair and burning it,--

LOKI trades one of the cards in HIS hand for the hidden one, and CAIN notices.

*PERSEPHONE

\--my mother had run away and sworn eternal seclusion-(from the entire world--)

CAIN quickly moves and punches LOKI in the jaw, sending LOKI backwards. The OTHERS quickly move out of the way, except SET who does so slowly.

LOKI rubs HIS jaw and laughs.

*LOKI

Why did I earn that, big boy?

*CAIN

You cheated! You lied!

*LOKI

Of course I did, stupid! That's who I am. I'm Loki, the cheating liar. How else am I supposed to win every game I play?

*CAIN

No more. No more!

*VENUS

You two are ruining the game.

*PERSEPHONE

More fury. More pain. Give me more of it, please? Stop being so selfish!

*VENUS

Set, will you please do something?

SET shows HIS binding.

*CAIN

I will destroy you, liar.

*LOKI

What? Over a simple card game you were horribly losing at? You need to get some higher standards, sir.

CAIN throws a punch, which LOKI easily dodges.

*CAIN

Fight with honor!

*LOKI

Uuuuuuhm...no.

CAIN rushes at LOKI, but LOKI sweeps CAIN"S legs out from underneath HIM and HE drops to the floor. LOKI jumps on CAIN's back and pins HIS arm behind HIS back. CAIN yells angrily from the pain.

*LOKI

Crying will get you nowhere, child.

*CAIN

Shut up! I...will...not...be defeated!

CAIN maneuvers HIS other arm and twists out of the hold, throwing LOKI to the ground. Before LOKI can get up, CAIN moves in and pummels LOKI to the ground. CAIN throws punch after punch, and LOKI can't stop laughing hysterically.

*CAIN

Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!

*LOKI

How can...I? This is too...funny.

*PERSEPHONE

Loki, share with me your shattered mind. Taint me with your mercurial madness.

*SET

This is much better than the card game. Make sure you pound his spleen in for me, Cain.

*CAIN

You cheat! You liar! You sinner! Why don't you just leave us in peace, you clown?!

*LOKI

This is....this is more than I could ever hope for. Shattering your mind is just the funniest joke to play on anyone I know.

CAIN stands up and yells at the sky. This is actually terrifying to ALL, even LOKI a little bit.

*CAIN

Injustices. Injustices! I am surrounded by injustices. Sinners of all walks of life, they surround me. Their stench clogs my throat and burns my eyes. Everywhere I see red. Bloody, sticky, clotted crimson red! Red! Diseases on legs! Plagues! Plagues!!!

CAIN roars at the gods in the sky. LOKI is impressed.

SFX: A more elegant alarm; not rough, but more white room.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Subjects Cain and Loki, you have been selected for analysis. Do not fight the process, and this will all be over very soon. Thank you for cooperating.

ALL except CAIN and LOKI exit.

SFX: A high-pitched, ringing.

LOKI stands up next to CAIN.

*LOKI

Well...at least we'll be with each other.

The light rises almost blindingly, and then BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE V

ACT I, SCENE VI

The room. LOKI and CAIN are bound to their chairs, sitting directly across from each other with a long table between them. Two chairs sit in the middle for PROMETHEUS and KALI.

Long beat.

*LOKI

Soooo--

*CAIN

Shut up.

*LOKI

But--

*CAIN

No.

*LOKI

I...yeah, you're right.

Beat.

*LOKI

Is this room brighter?

Beat.

*LOKI

Than it was last time?

Beat.

*CAIN

Yes. It's brighter.

Half-beat.

*LOKI

I thought so.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

*COMPUTER (OV)

Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Please be complacent as our doctors enter to examine you. Thank you for cooperating.

PROMETHEUS enters with notepad in hand, and KALI carries a briefcase.

*LOKI

Ah! The good doctors, thank you for seeing us on such short notice. I have an unusual rash that itches like the dickens.

*KALI

Do you think I find that comment humorous?

*LOKI

I do.

*KALI

I don't. So why make a joke when your target audience will not find it funny?

*LOKI

I'm my own audience. And I love me.

*PROMETHEUS

How are you doing today, Cain? Feeling calmer? Have you been working on those breathing exercises we talked about?

PROMETHEUS notices CAIN looking up at LOKI as a response.

*PROMETHEUS

Is Loki being difficult again? [to LOKI] Are you tempting Cain into aggressive tendencies again?

*LOKI

Uh, duh. That's who I am. I'm Loki.

*KALI

We are going to perform a few psychological tests on you two. You will both answer to all of our questions and do so honestly. Loki, no jokes. Cain, you will answer. Otherwise, punishment will follow. Do you understand? [half-beat] Answer, gentlemen.

*CAIN

Yes.

*LOKI

I guess so.

*KALI

Good.

KALI opens the briefcase and takes out an inkblot image.

*KALI

See it? See it perfectly well? Cain?

*CAIN

I do see it.

*KALI

And you?

*LOKI

Am I supposed to see something more than spilt ink on paper?

*PROMETHEUS

Yes. If you use your imaginations, you'll see something hidden within the images. Think of them as art. You'll see what you'll want to see. And then, you'll tell us what you see. Now, could you please tell us what you see here?

Half-beat.

*CAIN

Your mother.

LOKI, somewhat surprised, coughs out a few laughs. To KALI, this is no joking matter. SHE hands the image to Prometheus and calmly, slowly walks over to CAIN and gets close.

*KALI

Are you disobeying me?

*CAIN

I am not your servant.

*PROMETHEUS

No, you're our patient. And we are here to help you. Isn't that right, Dr. Kali?

*KALI

Most definitely. And we have many methods of helping our patients see the light. Some are more painful than others.

*LOKI

I see my brother.

*PROMETHEUS

Do you? Which one?

*LOKI

Odin, that one-eyed bastard.

*KALI

In what form do you see him, Loki?

*LOKI

I guess the future Odin. Not the now Odin, but the will-be-Odin.

*KALI

What's the difference?

*LOKI

The future Odin has no face.

*PROMETHEUS

Curious. Why is that?

*LOKI

Because I smashed his face in with his son's hammer. See how it's all over the place. I think that dot right there is a molar.

*PROMETHEUS

I don't doubt that you see that. However, it does trouble me that you still see violence in a humorous angle.

*LOKI

Violence is funny! Ask anyone.

*KALI

I don't find it funny at all.

*LOKI

Oh, come on. I saw the grin last time you shocked the hell out of the poor wheat farmer over here. You can't fake that.

*KALI

I...I was thinking of how much I was helping him.

*CAIN

Liar.

*KALI

Don't call me that again. I mean it.

*PROMETHEUS

We want you both to become better. We do take pride in our jobs, and that's what you were probably seeing. Right Dr. Kali?

*KALI

Dr. Prometheus, I don't believe this test is getting many results. On to the second test.

*PROMETHEUS

As you wish.

PROMETHEUS takes out a metronome, places it on the table, and carefully positions the timer so that it begins its beat.

*PROMETHEUS

This part of the test deals with word association. I, or Dr. Kali here, will give you a word. You will have two beats before you must respond with another word. The word can be anything, but it has to be given quickly. Do you both understand?

*CAIN

Yes.

*LOKI

Who goes first?

*PROMETHEUS

Actually, I'll leave that decision up to you two.

*LOKI

Hmm. Interesting. A pointless task to be decided upon by two self-righteous maniacs. Oh, the excitement is killing me.

*KALI

He's right. Cain, you'll go first. Loki, you'll go two beats after Cain. Are you both ready?

*CAIN

Yes.

*LOKI

Righty-ho, good sir!

*KALI

Begin. Happiness.

*CAIN

Impossible.

*LOKI

Pain.

*KALI

Misery.

*CAIN

Reality.

*LOKI

A joke.

KALI looks at PROMETHEUS.

*PROMETHEUS

Family.

*CAIN

Dead.

*LOKI

Ghosts.

*PROMETHEUS

Love.

*CAIN

Brother.

*LOKI

Stupid.

*PROMETHEUS

Doctors.

Beat.

*PROMETHEUS

Doctors.

Beat.

KALI stops the metronome.

*KALI

Do you need more time?

*CAIN

No.

*KALI

Then what's your answer?

*CAIN

Targets.

A very, very tense beat.

*PROMETHEUS

Let's try the final test. It's simple. It's quick. It should be easy. Can we please continue?

Half-beat.

*PROMETHEUS

It's a simple question. Cain, do you see yourself in the future ever capable of forgiving Loki for all his transgressions?

CAIN and LOKI both laugh.

*CAIN

What? Forgiveness?

*PROMETHEUS

Yes. Forgiveness is an act of self-redemption. If you can see yourself capable of this in the future, then that means you're willing to get better. Do you see yourself forgiving Loki? Ever?

*LOKI

Do you?

*CAIN

I would rather cut my own heart out with my scythe and eat it over a raging fire.

*LOKI

Aww, I knew you cared.

*PROMETHEUS

Loki?

*LOKI

Mm-hmm?

*PROMETHEUS

Do you see yourself asking for Cain's forgiveness?

*LOKI

Look, doctor. I can see you're really trying to help me. Really, I can. I'm not some monster in the darkness without a brain. I can see what's what. If Dr. Kali there asked me this, I'd give some smartass question to piss her off. Since it's you, I won't. Will I ever ask for forgiveness? No. And here's why; I know who I am. On the inside. And no matter how hard you two try to change that, it won't. Not ever. I'm never asking for that prick's forgiveness. Never.

*PROMETHEUS

That's...unfortunate that you believe that. I believe that with the right support,--

*KALI

\--and conditioning.

*PROMETHEUS

...that we will heal your mental wounds. I have faith in you, Loki. Both of you. But for now, since you failed the tests, there has to be a consequence. Unfortunately.

*KALI

When you two go back, you'll be bound to each other. You will not be able to do anything without the other being right there with you. You'll have to cooperate. Or else, suffer. I'm thrilled to see how this will work out.

*CAIN

You are a bitch. And a fool. And if I ever get a chance, I will make you suffer.

*KALI

You never will.

KALI and PROMETHEUS pack up the briefcase and gather THEIR notes. KALI exits.

*PROMETHEUS

This is for your benefits. I care for all of my patients. I know you'll get better.

PROMETHEUS exits.

Beat.

*LOKI

I can't say I won't drag you through hell this week, but I will say this; I hope you get your chance with Dr. Kali. We all do.

*CAIN

Thank you.

BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE VI

ACT I, SCENE VII

The oubliette.

TIAMAT howls OFFSTAGE. YMIR enters, cautious and ready for combat. SET enters with the same amount of tension, and HE is no longer wearing the shackles. THEY staredown EACHOTHER, just long enough to pass the initial instinct to beat down an aggressor.

*SET

Do you know where Tiamat is?

*YMIR

No. You're hands are free.

*SET

Yes, I was relieved of my punishment. Don't know why they put them on me in the first place. I didn't change. Are you...fleeing from her? Know when you've met your superior?

YMIR growls.

*SET

What? Come at me. I'll rip your oversized jaw and cut out your heart with it.

*YMIR

You smell of fear.

*SET

From you?

*YMIR

Her. Your heart beats loud and fast. You're afraid.

*SET

Of that hairy witch-beast?! I don't have to be scared to know I don't like beatings.

YMIR walks up to SET.

*SET

Yes?

*YMIR

You...are...afraid.

Beat. SET walks away and sits down on the ground. YMIR chuckles.

*SET

Shut it!

*VENUS (OS)

Set? Set call back to me!

*SET

Company with the whore. And the walking mountain. I hope Tiamat comes for me soon. End this disgrace.

*YMIR

There is no end. It never ends. Nothing ends. But memory.

VENUS enters. SHE has been severely beaten and looks like a throttled mouse that escaped the cat.

*VENUS

Set. Ymir. She...she...

*SET

Caught you?

*VENUS

Come help me.

SET walks over to VENUS.

*SET

I don't see why I should. Or what I could do.

*VENUS

Hold me! Keep me up and off my bruises.

*SET

Who are you--(to boss me around--)

*VENUS

Do it!

VENUS falls into SET's open arms.

*VENUS

Thank you. Thank you.

*SET

Is this so much better? You're in the arms of a king. Feel grateful.

*VENUS

[Laughing] King of what? Sand, dust, or rocks? Oww.

*SET

Ymir, get me a rag and water.

Half-beat.

*SET

Or do you want to hold her and let her whine to you?

*YMIR

She lost her battle. She should feel her wounds and be silent.

*SET

You think that's what she'll do?

YMIR growls and then exits. SET watches VENUS as SHE tries to calm down HER breathing.

*SET

What did you do to anger the mad dog this night?

*VENUS

Nothing. I looked at her. I looked at her in her eyes.

*SET

Were you wanting a beating? You could have asked me. I would have kept from bruising your face.

*VENUS

So kind. I...I just wanted to know her. Feel her passions. Let them wash over me and make me warm. I know the rest of you. I know you all so much, I sometimes think I am a collection of you instead of me alone.

YMIR enters with a bowl and a rag. HE drops it next to SET. SET takes the rag and very delicately dabs at VENUS' face. Ymir stares.

*SET

[To YMIR] What?

*YMIR

[Chuckling] You are a maid servant.

SET drops the rag and VENUS on the ground. VENUS winces and curls up. SET stands up to YMIR and shoves HIM.

*SET

I have no problem putting you in your place today, stone-pusher.

*YMIR

You challenge me?

*SET

Yes, I do. I'm not that ridiculous hyena Loki or the spoiled child Cain. Unlike them, I can defeat you.

*YMIR

Then do it.

Beat. TIAMAT howls.

*SET

Tomorrow?

*YMIR

Yes.

SET walks over to VENUS who is washing HERSELF.

*SET

Why did you ask me to help you if you could do that yourself?

YMIR moves to leave.

*SET

Hey! Where are you going?

*YMIR

Find others.

YMIR exits.

*SET

What for?

*YMIR (OS)

I am thinking.

*SET

You're what?! It's a magical day when stones think like people. [To VENUS] I find you appealing this way.

*VENUS

Broken? Can you only enjoy another if they are beaten and with no willpower? Does your libido only thrive on servants and slaves; those powerless to defy you? Those whom must obey your every wish, command, and desire? Is that what you like?

*SET

Yes. I am a king. That's the way it should be.

*VENUS

Will you be with me if I stay this way for you?

*SET

Clean your wounds. And when Tiamat's night of terror is over, I will test your ability to serve.

*VENUS

I will take what I can get.

*SET

You should feel honored to be my concubine, Venus.

*VENUS

Then why don't I?

*SET

It's not my place (--to think on the weakness of others)

*CAIN (OS)

\--Stop pulling me to the ground! You'll get us caught!

Enter CAIN and LOKI, bound at the wrists by a physical tether.

*LOKI

It'll be worth it if I get to see you pummeled before me.

*CAIN

You think this chain allows you the chance to harm me even more?

*LOKI

Uh, yeah. I do. Watch.

LOKI pulls on the chain and sweeps CAIN's legs from underneath. LOKI quickly positions HIS knee over CAIN's chest and throat. CAIN can hardly speak.

*LOKI

You know, I seem to recall when our positions were reversed not so long ago. Perhaps I should follow through where you didn't have the chance.

*VENUS

You'll only weaken yourselves before she gets a chance to. She takes it personally when she can't tenderize her meat.

*LOKI

You don't say.

*CAIN

Get...off...

*LOKI

Mmmmm, no. No, I don't think I want that. Not one bit.

CAIN pulls LOKI down to the ground and pins LOKI's arm behind the back.

*CAIN

Stop fighting me, clown!

*LOKI

You know, everyone calls me a clown. But why is it that I find you to be the funny ones?

YMIR enters with a crying PERSEPHONE over HIS shoulder. HE drops HER on the ground. CAIN stands up, and LOKI does not use the chance to retaliate.

*SET

Why did you bring her here?

*YMIR

She can help.

*CAIN

Help? Her help?

*PERSEPHONE

Help? Help me? Help you? I can help no one. You all fall to pieces, and I can't sew you back together again.

*VENUS

Really, Ymir, you're too sentimental. Let the little girl go and fend for herself.

*SET

We already have one whimpering, bleeding woman here. Why bring another?

*LOKI

A one sided threesome?

*YMIR

I am tired of Tiamat. I want her beatings no more. My body demands revenge. And so do yours.

*PERSEPHONE

Soreness, soreness, soreness all around.

*CAIN

We all hate Tiamat, but there's nothing we can do about it except fight and lose.

*VENUS

Ymir, dear, please rush to the climax of this thought of yours. We're all tingling to know what you're thinking.

*YMIR

One of us is weaker than Tiamat. All of us are stronger than her.

*LOKI

A circle jerk? Really?

*SET

Your thick skull must prevent good memory. We've tried this before. It worked, until she got free. And then, well, that's why Cain here is missing a few teeth. And his manhood.

*CAIN

Shut up!

CAIN moves to hit SET, but YMIR stops HIM.

*CAIN

Release me, mountain, before I tear you down stone by stone.

PERSEPHONE holds CAIN's legs.

*PERSEPHONE

Please. Let him speak.

*YMIR

We fight together. We win. We hold her down. The light finds her. No longer our problem.

Beat.

*CAIN

[to LOKI] You think they'll take her?

*LOKI

They never have before.

*VENUS

Tiamat is deathly afraid of the light. She cuddles the darkness like a long dead lover, hoping that it's spirit will protect her from the dangers of life.

*LOKI

It's worth a shot.

*SET

However good a plan it sounds, remember that this idea trickled out of the cave in that giant's head.

*LOKI

Yeah, I'm kind of pissed that the stupidest one of us had the best solution for our problem.

*VENUS

I think we should try it.

*CAIN

I agree.

*LOKI

Set? Don't be a sore thumb, just because the slow kid showed us all up.

*SET

Fine. I'll do it.

*PERSEPHONE

Don't leave me behind. My entity will ash and crumble away without the warmth of my fellow blindmen.

LOKI points down to PERSEPHONE.

*LOKI

Bait?

YMIR nods.

*LOKI

Venus? A little help?

VENUS picks up PERSEPHONE and THEY both limp away OFFSTAGE.

*PERSEPHONE

Will you join me in my death march, my broken heart?

*VENUS

You really must find someone to love you back, dear. Your solo existence is bringing us all down.

PERSEPHONE and VENUS exit.

*LOKI

And there they go.

*CAIN

Can they do it?

*SET

All they have to do is run away. I trust them to do that.

*CAIN

What now?

THEY all stare at EACHOTHER. NONE really wishes to talk to the OTHERS. SET sits. CAIN paces back and forth. LOKI stands and lets HIS arm go back and forth with the pacing CAIN. YMIR stands watch.

*PERSEPHONE (OS)

Here she comes! Oh spirit of death, take us quickly and leave nothing of our sins behind.

*VENUS (OS)

Move your curvaceous ass now, woman!

VENUS and PERSEPHONE quickly run past the MEN.

*VENUS

Get her now!

TIAMAT is hustling by and doesn't even realize the MEN until THEY grapple HER. SHE yells like a trapped and frightened Kodiac bear.

*SET

Hold her down!

*CAIN

What do you think I'm doing?!

*LOKI

Venus!

VENUS comes over and helps pinning down TIAMAT's torso.

*CAIN

To the light!

THEY heft TIAMAT into the air and walk HER over to where the light comes. TIAMAT realizes what THEY are doing and freaks out.

*YMIR

Hold her!

SFX: The alarm sounds.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Subject Tiamat, you have been selected for analysis. Do not fight the process, and this will all be over very soon. Thank you for cooperating.

*YMIR

Hold her!

SFX: A high-pitched, ringing.

*CAIN

Here we go!

*LOKI

And so our little angel finds her home in the sky! [laughs]

The lights rise almost blindingly, then BLACKOUT.

END ACT I, SCENE VII

ACT I, SCENE VIII

The room. Tiamat is bound to the chair, with the table in front of her but no chairs. SHE is not asleep. SHE sits still and waits for what is about to unfold.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

PROMETHEUS and KALI enter, neither holding anything this time. PROMETHEUS is immediately troubled, looking closely at TIAMAT, even going so far as to hold HER hand. TIAMAT is unmoved. KALI stands far back, trying to solve this enigmatic puzzle.

*PROMETHEUS

Tiamat? Tiamat? Are you with us?

*KALI

She can hear you. She knows you're there.

*PROMETHUS

Tiamat, I want to talk to you about how you ended up here with us today. Okay? Normally, our visits are done in secrecy, but the actions of your fellow companions forced us to move our hands. In an unforeseen act of cooperation, they have all taken it upon themselves to do what they must to remove you from their presence. How do you feel about that?

*TIAMAT

Winter is now here,

The bear sleeps in solitude,

He needs no one's love.

*KALI

Riddles. All we ever get from you are riddles. You believe that this is the only form in which you can communicate, but I know that's not correct. If you can speak one word, then you can assemble a coherent sentence. This poetic dialogue is simply another way for you to distance yourself.

*PROMETHEUS

You need friends. Connections. Relationships. Now, I'm not saying that the others' have healthy relationships with each other, or that you should mimic them, but maybe you should perhaps watch them and try to be a part of the group. It would do you some good to socialize.

*KALI

Beating them into submission does not suffice. You're their physical superior. You've nothing more to prove on that. So, what else do you have? What other things are you capable of, other than hate and destruction? And riddles?

*TIAMAT

The unseen wind blows,

Sometimes it's fast, others slow,

It obeys nature.

*KALI

Again with the riddles.

*PROMETHEUS

Nature? Is there no nurturing you into something more? You can be so much more, if you allow us to help you. Just let us help you. Please?

Beat.

PROMETHEUS walks over to KALI, where THEY speak away from the patient.

*PROMETHEUS

I'm now more than ever worried for our patient. Every attempt to reach her in some way has ended in failure. I believe we may need more drastic measures.

*KALI

I agree. We've been too lenient of her antisocial behaviors. I believe we need to become stricter and enforce limitations on her mobility. Perhaps if she can no longer run away from others, she'll be forced to confront them.

As KALI and PROMETHEUS talk, TIAMAT leans down and spits out a pick into HER hand. With it, she secretly works to open her binds.

*PROMETHEUS

Every time we restrict her in some form or fashion, her rebellious tendencies are activated, and she puts up a wall between herself and improvement. I don't believe punishment is the way to help her.

*KALI

You believe that of all our patients.

*PROMETHEUS

Yes. I do.

TIAMAT manages to unlock one of her binds. SHE immediately starts working on the other.

*KALI

How can you believe that? These demented, deranged individuals have defined their realities by pain, suffering, and despair. They're corrupted by these concepts and cannot see anything else. But if we manipulate how they feel these things, direct them towards our goals, then and only then do I believe we will help them.

*PROMETHEUS

Is it possible that you're deflecting your own fears upon them?

*KALI

Don't analyze me, Dr. Prometheus. We are both here to help. Not to discredit each other.

TIAMAT's bounds are undone. SHE quickly escapes.

TIAMAT swiftly kicks PROMETHEUS' legs from underneath HIM and then slugs HIM in the head, knocking HIM immediately unconscious.

*KALI

Computer, alert! Escapee!

SFX: the alarms sound off.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Warning, warning. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Patient Tiamat, please comply. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Thank you for cooperating.

KALI backs away from TIAMAT. TIAMAT stalks KALI, preparing for a devastating and swift attack. KALI realizes this and switches from stern doctor to battle-ready warrior. KALI's more primal nature flares out, and SHE attacks TIAMAT first. KALI manages a hit, but TIAMAT takes it in stride and binds KALI from behind and pushes HER to the floor. TIAMAT then knocks the back of KALI's head and knocks the doctor out.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Warning, warning. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Patient Tiamat, please comply. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Thank you for cooperating.

TIAMAT hisses at the incorporeal voice, and then escapes.

END ACT I, SCENE VIII

END ACT I

ACT II, SCENE I

The oubliette.

SFX: the alarms are still sounding off.

SET and PERSEPHONE are on the ground; SET towering over PERSEPHONE. THEY were in the beginning of a sexual act, but now seemed very confused.

*PERSEPHONE

Have they come? Have they come to end my miserable existence, once and for all? Have the come for me?!

*SET

Shut up! I have no idea what this is, but it's not about you.

THEY stand, mesmerized by the new event. YMIR enters, equally confused, but HE immediately thinks that SET has something to do with it. YMIR catches SET from behind in a sleeper lock. SET is furious, but with the hold on HIS throat, HE cannot say much about it.

*YMIR

What did you do?! Why do you do this? Burning lights. Loud sounds. Stop it. NOW!

*PERSEPHONE

He can't! He is not the cause of this great disturbance, but if you promise to treat me as equally brutal, I will claim it.

VENUS rushes in and pulls at YMIR's grasp.

*VENUS

Ymir, let go! It isn't him. I've been watching these two exploring one another at my behest, and they have done nothing to cause this. Ymir, drop him!

YMIR looks at VENUS. Figuring SHE'd never lie, HE drops SET. SET gasps for air, trying to shout curses but unable to do so. PERSEPHONE hovers over HIM.

*PERSEPHONE

My wounder is wounded. You were supposed to give me the pain. Not hoard it.

CAIN and LOKI wander in. YMIR points to LOKI.

*YMIR

You! Trickster! This smells of your doings.

*LOKI

Are you as much of an idiot as you are big?

LOKI holds up HIS arm, which raises CAIN's arm.

*CAIN

He's been with me. He's innocent.

*LOKI

Wow. That's the first time I've ever been called that.

SFX: The alarm is cut off by the sound of electricity crackling.

All is black.

*YMIR

Who has done this?! Be a warrior and fight where I see you!

*SET

This has gone far enough. Whoever you are, end this now. I command it.

Half-beat.

*LOKI

Well that didn't work. Maybe you forgot to say "please".

CAIN hits LOKI in the head.

*LOKI

Ow! How did you know where my head was?

*CAIN

Good question.

*VENUS

Our only chance of defense is for us to move together, huddle our warm bodies into one mass, and gain strength through a warm embrace. Come. To the center, and follow my voice.

*CAIN

I'd rather take my chances.

*PERSEPHONE

Oh, great doctors! Please, never bring back the gift of light to us. Let me bear this loss of senses with a heavy heart. Never again allow me the knowledge of my form, leaving us ghosts in a formless world.

The lights rise. TIAMAT is standing above the unconscious bodies of PROMETHEUS and KALI. SHE is unsure if SHE should be proud of her prize or run away to safety.

*VENUS

Tiamat, what have you done?

TIAMAT growls and clicks at VENUS, and then SHE runs off.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Warning, warning. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Patients Tiamat, Set, Ymir, Venus, Cain, Loki, Persephone please comply. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Thank you for cooperating.

Beat.

*LOKI

Why aren't they coming to get us?

*YMIR

They're afraid?

*SET

No. If fear were enough to free us, I alone would have freed us a long time ago. No, this is very different.

*PERSEPHONE

They gave back the light. Why torture us so?

*CAIN

They can't do anything. They can't make us do anything. Tiamat has done something very wrong. [points to PROMETHEUS and KALI] And they're about to pay the price. Mind-manipulating bastards!

CAIN goes to stomp on PROMETHEUS's head, but LOKI stops HIM.

*LOKI

You fool! Who knows what this game holds for us? Their deaths could mean our own. IF we're lucky.

*YMIR

Torture them.

*LOKI

Yeah, I could live with that.

*VENUS

I have my private chairs and rope. Set, please come with me.

VENUS and SET exit the stage.

*PERSEPHONE

They look like they're sleeping. Sleeping babes in the night air, feeling nothing but dreams and whispers. How sad.

CAIN moves towards KALI and PROMETHEUS.

*LOKI

Cain, listen to me! You can either kill them right here, right now, or you can give everyone a chance to kill them little by little. Piece by piece. Pull their souls apart like they did ours. Isn't that something you want?

CAIN nods and backs off.

*LOKI

Good.

*PERSEPHONE

I wish I were dead.

*LOKI

Not now, sweetie. Grownups are talking.

VENUS and SET enter with a chair each and the rope.

EVERYONE helps to put PROMETHEUS and KALI in the chairs and bind them.

*CAIN

Now what?

*VENUS

We wake them.

*CAIN

How?

PERSEPHONE stands up and slaps both PROMETHEUS and KALI across the face. THEY gradually wake up.

*LOKI

Effective.

PROMETHEUS and KALI wake up groggy and unaware.

*PROMETHEUS

Wha...Where? What happened?

*KALI

No. We're...with the patients.

*VENUS

You sure are, honey. Take a seat. Get comfortable. Release your inhibitions, for what else is there to do when you're trapped in a hole with nothing but your bodies to play with?

*LOKI

And minds. Don't forget minds.

*YMIR

The pain. Feeling pain.

*CAIN

The pain is all.

*KALI

Let us go. Right now. Now! If you don't let us go, there will be consequences. Severe consequences. And I'm not talking about your punishments or restrictions. I'm talking about true torture.

*PROMETHEUS

Kali!

PERSEPHONE crawls up KALI's leg.

*PERSEPHONE

So tempting! More to take from us? More to harm us with? Please, please, please give it to us. Now, hard and without thought. Punish us. Punish us!

*KALI

Get off me, you deranged hedonist!

The PATIENTS all laugh.

*LOKI

Well it looks like Doctor Kali is fitting right in, doesn't it?

*SET

Perfectly.

*PROMETHEUS

[to KALI] Don't provoke them. You'll only serve to hinder their treatments.

*KALI

Get us out, NOW! Computer! Computer!

Half-beat.

*LOKI

The system is down. Sucks to be you.

KALI

Computer!!

YMIR reaches over and slaps KALI in the face. KALI takes the hit hard and is disoriented for a moment. The PATIENTS laugh.

*PERSEPHONE

Yes, more hitting, more slapping, more pain. More of all those things down here for you, Doctor Kali.

*PROMETHEUS

Set, please hear me. You are a natural born leader. People look up to you as an example. Show them a positive one and tell them to release us.

*SET

No. You don't get to analyze me down here, Doctor. Down here, I am god. You follow my rules, and pray to us. I say you stay down here until you rot.

VENUS sits down on PROMETHEUS and tries to provoke him erotically.

*VENUS

You know, Prometheus, there are many different ways to spend your time down here. You could pout like a baby, go crazy in your little dark corner, or beat your body against ours. Open yourself to our diseased minds.

*PROMETHEUS

Venus, this is not the way to find love.

*LOKI

Love? [laughs]

*CAIN

What do you know of love? You wish for us to hold hands and sing songs. Hug one another and forgive everyone of everything. But what if I don't want to forgive? What if my love is the same as my hate? And if I stop hating, I stop loving. Tell me, do you want me to love you now?

PROMETHEUS finally admits to defeat, refusing to perpetuate their little games with more speeches.

*LOKI

Kali? You here? Kali?

*KALI

Yes, I'm awake, what is it?

*LOKI

It's time to feel the pain. Pick your poison.

*KALI

What?

*YMIR

Me. It's me! I'm first.

*CAIN

The hell you are! I'm first.

*VENUS

I think I'm first, at least as far as parts of Doctor Prometheus are concerned.

*PERSEPHONE

I'm last! Ooooh, I love the wait.

*LOKI

I don't remember asking any of you. I asked Kali.

*KALI

Am I to assume that you want me to choose who is to torture us first?

*LOKI

Mm-hmm.

KALI and PROMETHEUS share a look, trying to exchange some communication as to whom to select. PROMETHEUS is helpless.

*KALI

Ymir. We choose Ymir first. He will be the worst, so we might as well get over with it.

*SET

He is not the worst.

YMIR huffs.

*VENUS

Come on, everyone. Give them their private time with Ymir. It's only fair.

PATIENTS except YMIR begin to walk away.

*PERSEPHONE

[to LOKI] I called last. You heard me, right? I am the last to unleash my frailties upon their undeserving bodies. I am last to see them as unbroken as they'll ever be. You know I'm last, don't you?

SET exits.

*LOKI

Who gives a shit?! And yes, I heard you.

LOKI exits.

*PERSEPHONE

Good. You all heard it right? Set? Set, you heard me, didn't you?

PERSEPHONE exits. VENUS waves, then exits.

CAIN is standing there, smiling. YMIR stares at CAIN.

*CAIN

I'm leaving. Enjoy.

CAIN starts to leave.

*YMIR

I will.

*CAIN

I wasn't talking to you.

CAIN exits. YMIR paces back and forth behind the DOCTORS.

*PROMETHEUS

Kali. Doctor. They'll rescue us soon. I'm sure it's just a malfunction in the computer's CPU. Perhaps a programing error, but we will be released. Keep hope. We will be saved.

YMIR walks around in front of them.

*KALI

Not soon enough.

YMIR laughs. It starts strong and rises to monstrous levels.

END ACT II, SCENE I

ACT II, SCENE II

The oubliette.

YMIR is standing tall and proud from HIS work. PROMETHEUS and KALI are breathing slowly and attempting to keep consciousness. YMIR walks around, watching THEM while HE wonders if HE's through.

*KALI

What next, Ymir? Another fist in my face? Perhaps a blow to Prometheus' abdomen? When will you learn that no matter how many punches you throw, you will never attain the inner peace you so desperately chase after in the dark with the rest of these miscreants?

PROMETHEUS coughs.

*KALI

Doctor, is your health fading?

*PROMETHEUS

No. Not yet. And there is no point in taunting a patient, Doctor Kali. Especially not now. I suspect that Ymir has finished his turn.

*YMIR

Yes. I'm done. My heart is calm. It beats softer. I am happy.

*PROMETHEUS

I am pleased that you find yourself capable of such, Ymir.

*YMIR

[to Offstage] Venus!

YMIR walks Offstage without a glance at the two DOCTORS. KALI pulls at the rope.

*KALI

Doctor, don't just sit there and accept this. Try to free yourself. At least try!

*PROMETHEUS

Even if we were to free ourselves, we have nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. In any situation, we will have no option but to wait for the computer to restore itself. The time might as well be spent with our patients. We have an obligation no matter what condition we find ourselves.

*KALI

You...fool. Fool! To sit idly by and accept the beatings. What condition do you think we'll be in when the computer is restored? I doubt we'll be in one piece.

*PROMETHEUS

Anything that can be broken can be fixed. Anything.

KALI gives up talking to PROMETHEUS and continues to tug on the ropes. Enter VENUS.

*VENUS

Hello, you two. I'm so happy you could visit me in my home. I hope you don't mind I invited another to come play with us.

Enter PERSEPHONE.

*PERSEPHONE

She is so cruel a gifter. I want only to be last, to be given the last position, and she treats me with more time to spend with our healers. She does not even threaten to deny me my last place, to rob me of my dream, my nightmares, but forces me to have two turns. I yearn, I crave to be tortured so. Venus, puncture my heart with a sin. Insert some darkness into my soul.

*VENUS

She wouldn't stop bothering the others. She almost seems aglow with excitement, don't you think? You two are having such an effect on us little prisoners down here.

*PROMETHEUS

Persephone, listen to me, pain is not pleasure reversed. To harm another, to harm yourself, is nothing more than harm. You are giving and receiving pain. Not pleasure.

*PERSEPHONE

I...I can't tell a difference anymore.

PERSEPHONE sits down on PROMETHEUS' lap.

*PERSEPHONE

And if I can't split the hairs between the two, why do it at all? My world is a blend of so many interesting colors. Any action gives me everything. I would never do anything to change that.

*KALI

Get off of him. Now! Act like a decent person and give us some respect.

*PERSEPHONE

No?

*PROMETHEUS

Incredible. You've denied someone's negativity towards you?

*VENUS

No, doctor. I told Persephone that if she follows Kali's orders, when punishments are handed out by the supreme order up high, I'd swear that Persephone was a pure innocent victim and wouldn't deserve a drop of vengeance. I am not stupid, Doctor Kali. Merely deranged. Thanks to you and your kind.

*KALI

We've tried to cure you. All of you. We have done nothing but be benevolent towards your kind.

*VENUS

And we never asked for it. Doesn't that make your attempts more malicious than charitable? I'd like to think so.

*PERSEPHONE

[to PROMETHEUS] I love your malicious ways.

PERSEPHONE starts to act physically erotic towards PROMETHEUS.

*PROMETHEUS

Persephone, please stop your advances.

*VENUS

Everything has already been set in motion, Doctor. No sense in saying "No", now. Is there, Kali?

VENUS starts doing the same towards KALI, but less so.

*KALI

What are you doing?

*VENUS

Forcing you to watch. I love watching. Especially when I made it happen.

*PROMETHEUS

Venus, is this what you really want?

*VENUS

Yes. Stop thinking of me as a victim. I am this way, because I am. We all are. Darkness does not wish to be turned to light, and neither do I.

*KALI

Do your worst. We will not enjoy it.

VENUS and PERSEPHONE laugh.

*VENUS

Oh really? Care to bet on that?

*KALI

And what do I have to bargain with?

*PROMETHEUS

Doctor Kali, no!

*VENUS

Your will. And your time. I don't see your will breaking soon. That happens eventually, but not right away. Not for those like you. No, your time will be enough for me. I bet you that the good doctor over there will enjoy whatever I throw at him. If I win, I get your next time in the light. You won't miss it, anyway. You still have warm sunlight fresh on your soft mind.

*KALI

I won't watch two of my patients molest my colleague.

*VENUS

Come on, doctor! I won't disrobe him or anything. Just...influence him.

VENUS walks over to PROMETHEUS and starts touching him as PERSEPHONE is.

*VENUS

I'll whisper sweet honey down his ears, glide my hands over his soft form, brush my cheeks against his warm body...mmmmmh. I'll set myself upon him, move with the beat of our hearts, smell his hair and make him smell mine--

PERSEPHONE whispers into VENUS' ear while KALI yells.

*KALI

Stop it! We are not animals! We will not subject ourselves to your madness or your misguided sexual urges. You are not animals either. You're worse. An animal acts out of instincts. Nature. You dive into your dark urges and manipulate yourselves to become things of wretched darkness and pity. Prometheus and I will not be your playthings. Punish us and beat us, but do not expect us to become as pathetic as you things are.

VENUS and PERSEPHONE giggle and both stand back from PROMETHEUS.

*VENUS

You were wise to not bet me, for it seems my simple animalistic charms have arisen the spirit within our good doctor already.

*PERSEPHONE

Tease him more? And then tease me, too?

*VENUS

No. I got what I came here for. I'm finished. For now. Come, Persephone. My turn is over.

VENUS exits. PERSEPHONE stands there, not sure about her own mixed feelings for the DOCTORS. SHE leans over to PROMETHEUS.

*PERSEPHONE

You'll hurt me later, won't you? The others don't care to anymore. I'm so lonely and bored.

*VENUS (OS)

Persephone!

PERSEPHONE runs and exits. PROMETHEUS moves to say something, but THEIR shared look shames HIM to silence.

*KALI

It was only natural.

Beat.

SET enters. HE has the mouse-eating grin of a champion while circling the two DOCTORS. HE chuckles.

*SET

The great doctors, angels from on high, the two saviors of the wicked, martyrs for the less fortunate. You two have a lot of explaining to do.

*KALI

I will not apologize for attempting to heal the unhealable.

*SET

And you doctor? Anything to say to me?

*PROMETHEUS

This will not do your treatment any good, Set.

*SET

Always with the need to heal others. Martyrdom does not mean superiority. Or equal. It just means stupid. My brother was the same way. Set in his ways. Only saw what he wanted to. I tried to warn him, too. Tried to explain to him what true power could do in the right hands. Strong hands. He ignored me. And so I killed him. But I'm not going to kill the two of you.

*KALI

What are you going to do?

SET exits, then enters with a third chair, which HE sits down on.

*SET

Kali...sorry, Doctor Kali. Tell me what you don't like about Doctor Prometheus here? Sorry, ...Prometheus.

*KALI

What?

*SET

No one's perfect. Everyone has flaws. I don't, but I'm not the one tied up. Yes, tell me your least favorite flaws about this man. And Doctor Prometheus, the same question to you next.

Half-beat.

*SET

Do what I say. You two have no power here. It's all mine. Do as I tell you to do. Or, you get beaten. Again. Now, Kali, tell me one thing, just one thing, you don't like about Prometheus.

*PROMETHEUS

Go on. I can accept whatever you have to say of me.

*KALI

He's weak.

*SET

Is that all?

*KALI

Not physically weak. Emotionally. For as intelligent and capable of a doctor he is, his compassion rules him and affects his choices.

*SET

That sounds like a real weakness. Doctor, you agree with her?

*PROMETHEUS

Obviously not. Compassion can never be limited.

*KALI

It was your compassion that brought that monster Tiamat so close to us during a computer malfunction.

*PROMETHEUS

What do you mean?

*KALI

I suggested long ago she was too much of a danger to herself and the others here. I filed the paperwork to obtain her a solitary confinement, and you vetoed it. You opposed my words, my diagnosis, and instead kept her in a free roaming environment. If she were separated like I wished her to be, she would have never been free to assault us.

*PROMETHEUS

Do you honestly believe that she would have been any closer to a cure? She is dangerous, yes, but she's a thinking, feeling individual. You don't lock people away and hope that they heal themselves. You help them. You care for them. You show them what the world outside of their own minds is like.

*KALI

If you place an infected patient with healthy ones, they will all become infected. You quarantine the infected, cure them, and then release them back into the wild. Your way, your compassion, is a blind man's game.

*SET

I have to say Dr.Prometheus, she makes a good point.

*PROMETHEUS

And that is all I need to prove my case.

*KALI

Because he approves of my words over your own?! You are so foolish--(if think for one moment...)

*SET

Shut up! It's Prometheus' turn. Doctor, do you have something to share with your opponent?

*PROMETHEUS

I will not harm my compatriot. Nor will I harm anyone else. Beat me if you must. I will not play this game.

SET is not happy by this. HE stands up and walks over to PROMETHEUS, staring the DOCTOR down. PROMETHEUS does not look away. Slowly and surely, SET chuckles.

*SET

You are a very stubborn one, Prometheus. She, on the other hand, she understands how things work down here. How they truly work up there, too. Don't lie to yourself. Cruelty is the best teacher.

TIAMAT howls offstage. SET looks up quickly, worried that there is no one to help defend HIM. HE could fight, but the idea of TIAMAT attacking the two DOCTORS is slightly more pleasing.

*SET

The faster you learn this, the better off you'll be. Here comes your next teacher. Try compassion on her.

SET exits.

KALI pulls on her binds even harder. This time, SHE gets a hand free and unbinds the other. SHE stands there, wondering what to do about PROMETHEUS. PROMETHEUS is at a loss for words as well.

TIAMAT enters. SHE smells PROMETHEUS a little, but the moving target KALI is much more interesting. KALI realizes that SHE's about to be attacked and prepares.

*KALI

Tiamat, listen to me. I am a doctor. I am here to help you, but if you attack me, there will be consequences. Severe consequences. I know this is the only way you know how to communicate, but if you dare attack me one more time, I will defend myself.

TIAMAT growls and rushes at KALI. KALI hardly blocks the blow and is thrown on the ground. KALI manages to give in a few good hits before TIAMAT slams her fists down over and over until KALI is passed out. TIAMAT smells the unconscious KALI, licks HER opponent's face, and then looks at PROMETHEUS.

*PROMETHEUS

Tiamat, whatever you have to do, remember I am here for you.

TIAMAT crawls over to PROMETHEUS, climbing up HER way to be face to face with the DOCTOR.

*PROMETHEUS

There are other ways of existing. You don't have to stay in pain any longer. Give up all your hatred, your fury, and I promise that you will be a better person for it. I would never lie to you.

*TIAMAT

A scar never heals.

It fades and is overgrown.

But it's always there.

TIAMAT moves away from PROMETHEUS and exits.

KALI is still unconscious on the floor. PROMETHEUS is left with his sorrow for the extreme derangements of the PATIENTS.

END ACT II, SCENE II

ACT II, SCENE III

The oubliette.

KALI remains on the floor. PROMETHEUS is still bound to the chair and has fallen asleep with the passage of time.

Enter CAIN and LOKI.

CAIN is pulling an unconscious LOKI by the hand along the floor towards PROMETHEUS. It's obvious that the two have been bound far too long, and CAIN cannot take the unfair punishment a second longer. CAIN walks over to PROMETHEUS and nudges the DOCTOR on the shoulder. PROMETHEUS slowly awakes, wondering exactly what could the rebellious CAIN possibly need from a beaten foe.

*CAIN

Unbind us. Now.

*PROMETHEUS

I suppose the time has come for you to no longer be so cruelly burdened by another's presence. I would ask if you had learned the benefits of cooperation, but I suspect that you haven't. Perhaps in the future.

CAIN moves HIS hand closer to PROMETHEUS.

*PROMETHEUS

My limbs are bound, Cain. I cannot help you unless you free me.

Half-beat.

*PROMETHEUS

I swear not to try and escape you. I am an honest person, and I promise that if you let me go, I will return the kindness.

*CAIN

Fine.

CAIN uses his free hand to untie PROMETHEUS. PROMETHEUS slowly stretches as HE stands up, feeling the stiff muscle spasms that comes with enforced immobility.

*PROMETHEUS

Thank you. It means much to me that you feel comfortable enough to trust me.

*CAIN

Do it.

PROMETHEUS consents and unbinds CAIN and LOKI. As soon as that happens, LOKI springs into action with a snazzy smile and jolly attitude.

*LOKI

Ta-dah! I'm awake. I've been playing you for the fool for hours now. Oh, how I had to bite my cheeks to keep from laughing as you grunted and sweated to pull my cumbersome body all around here.

*CAIN

You were faking!?!

*LOKI

Oh, come on now, sweetie. I'm not the first person whose had to fake it with you, am I?

CAIN's chest heaves up and down, and his fists clench and unclench. Eventually, CAIN calms down and lets the anger go.

*CAIN

I don't care. I'm free of you. That's all that matters.

*PROMETHEUS

Cain, you didn't take your revenge? That's great. You're learning how to control your instincts and show mercy instead.

*CAIN

Mercy? Mercy? Down here, in this little hole of ours, mercy does not exist. Indifference, boredom, repulsion, these are your new mercies. Learn to love them, just as no one here will love you.

*PROMETHEUS

I...You're being unnecessarily cruel.

*LOKI

Cruelty is the necessity down here.

*PROMETHEUS

No. It's not, Loki. It never was. Can't you see that?

*CAIN

It's my turn. My turn to torture the both of you. Loki, leave us.

*LOKI

Fair is fair. Goodbye, my little fire starter. May you reap what you ignite.

LOKI goes to leave.

*CAIN

No! Wait. I have a better idea.

*LOKI

I'm listening.

*CAIN

Guard Prometheus. I'm waking up Dr. Kali.

LOKI walks over to PROMETHEUS and lies HIS head upon the DOCTOR's shoulders.

*PROMETHEUS

Do so kindly, please. She is suffering from her early beatings. --(Perhaps ease her awake by--)

CAIN slaps KALI across her face, and LOKI chuckles. KALI awakes with a belligerent jolt and follows it with a slow realization of her surroundings. CAIN towers over her.

*KALI

What...where...the prison? I remember.

CAIN grabs KALI and pulls her up to her feet.

*CAIN

Stand!

*KALI

Unhand me!

For a moment, KALI and CAIN lock eyes and test each other's resolve.

*PROMETHEUS

Dr. Kali, please calm yourself. Defending yourself is within the realm of excusable. Accepting a martial challenge from a patient would be detrimental for both of you.

*CAIN

He has a point...Doc-tor.

*KALI

Tell me, Cain. What did you have in mind for your time with us?

CAIN smiles greatly and backs away.

*CAIN

Cards. We'll play a game of cards. The four of us.

*LOKI

That's an odd choice. Odd enough for me to like it. The same game?

*CAIN

The same.

CAIN points to both PROMETHEUS and KALI, motioning for LOKI to contain the two. CAIN goes OFFSTAGE.

PROMETHEUS goes to walk to KALI, but LOKI quickly pulls him back.

*PROMETHEUS

Doctor, we do not know our situation here. Neither of us can fathom why we are still captive down here, or even how long it will be until our inevitable release.

*LOKI

I sure know how that feels.

*PROMETHEUS

Please try to sustain the peace whenever we can. Perhaps we can continue our work and help them with their treatments.

*KALI

Down here?!

*PROMETHEUS

What is the alternative?

*LOKI

Be a prisoner. Forever.

CAIN returns with the bag of wooden nickels and deck of cards. LOKI takes the initiative and pulls the chairs and ropes OFFSTAGE, then returns quickly.

*PROMETHEUS

A card game. Thank you for letting us join in your solitary form of recreation. It means a lot to us. I'm glad you're seeing us as more approachable.

*LOKI

Well...it's not our only form of recreation, but it truly is our cleanest.

*CAIN

We're playing Dragon's Teeth. You know the game? Either of you?

*KALI

We do observe you in all your actions, Cain. There is not a single iota of thought we have not dissected, analyzed, and dissected all over again for our studies and curiosities. You are our test subjects, and like a respectable owner, I know everything about you.

*CAIN

Then you know how to play.

CAIN and LOKI take the far ends. PROMETHEUS and KALI sit down. CAIN hands out the four cards to each, and then he shares the wooden nickels.

*PROMETHEUS

I will not be needing time in the light. You can have them back.

*CAIN

It's how the game's played. Play it.

*LOKI

The trafficker of fate must take the first step.

CAIN moves his cards accordingly, then nods to KALI. KALI stares at CAIN.

*CAIN

It's your turn now.

KALI moves a few cards, throws down the rest, takes CAIN's replacements, and then she's done. The rest play normally.

*LOKI

So...here we are. Playing cards. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

*CAIN

Immeasurable. Dr. Prometheus--(...I have a question)

*PROMETHEUS

Prometheus, please. We are closer than official titles, yes?

*CAIN

I have a question for you.

*PROMETHEUS

Feel free to ask it.

*CAIN

How was the weather today?

*PROMETHEUS

Excuse me?

*CAIN

The weather. Describe it.

*PROMETHEUS

Well...It was somewhat cloudy. Warm, as always. And the sunset was very beautiful.

*CAIN

Kali, tell me how beautiful the sky was.

*KALI

Why?

*CAIN

Tell me how beautiful the sky was today.

*KALI

It was beautiful.

*LOKI

I don't believe her.

*CAIN

Tell me why it was beautiful.

*PROMETHEUS

It's a simple request. He is asking you to describe the outside world. What harm could it do?

*KALI

Very well. It was sunny. An unending supply of light. It was free for all. All those sane of mind, that is.

*PROMETHEUS

Dr. Kali, I don't think you're--(...asking with best intentions)

*CAIN

Tell me more about the surface world. How did it smell? Was the wind clean and cool?

*KALI

The purest of aerial gifts.

*CAIN

And the flora. Was the flora beautiful too?

*KALI

A kaleidoscope of pleasing hues.

*CAIN

And the food. Was there a plethora of consumables?

*KALI

More than fit for a king.

KALI throws down her cards and stands.

*KALI

Why are you asking me these things? You've never cared to talk about the outside world during our sessions, but suddenly when we are trapped here in our den of destitution, you're enthralled by it? What pleasure are you deriving from hearing such descriptions?!

*CAIN

I'm not.

*PROMETHEUS

Could you elaborate on that, please?

*CAIN

I'm not taking any pleasure from these questions. I'm taking pleasure from forcing you, Kali, to relive your memories of freedom. They're so vivid right now. That'll change. Eventually, you won't remember a thing before this prison. It'll be all that you are, just like it is me.

*LOKI

Ooooooh. Yeah, this is much more torturous than skin bruising. I'm beginning to like you a little, Cain. Just a little.

KALI's fury finally bubbles over the boiling point and she acts on her aggressive impulses. She grabs CAIN by the throat and pulls him to his feet.

*KALI

Then perhaps I should adapt to my surroundings. Mimic the behavior of miscreants and maniacs!

PROMETHEUS rises to his feet, but LOKI quickly puts him in an arm hold.

*PROMETHEUS

Doctor Kali!

*LOKI

Let's see what happens. Observe, and then obstruct.

*KALI

You. You are nothing but a adolescent minded fool. Forever believing you have been wronged and pretending that there is some retribution to be taken, only you are too self-blinded to realize that your need for vengeance will never be sated. It is a means to no end. A habit that shall never release you.

*CAIN

Yes, that sounds like me.

CAIN quickly makes KALI unhand him and within the same move pushes her back with an open-handed blow. KALI is taken by surprise by this, but SHE quickly responds by dodging an attack by CAIN and flipping him on his stomach. SHE puts her knee on his back and holds his arm in a lock.

During this, LOKI has released PROMETHEUS in all the excitement, but PROMETHEUS doesn't seem to want to interfere.

*LOKI

How far does one have to fall from heaven to become native to hell, doctor?

*PROMETHEUS

It's not a fall. It's a jump.

*KALI

You will not touch me again, Cain. Is that understood? You will address me with respect, and you will behave yourself in my presence. Do you understand me?

CAIN starts to laugh.

*LOKI

He's learning.

*KALI

Stop laughing! Why are you laughing?

*PROMETHEUS

He believes you've lowered yourself to his level.

KALI is struck with this dismal revelation. She lets go of CAIN and slowly backs away. CAIN is still laughing a little while rubbing his arm.

*CAIN

Come on, Loki. I'm finished.

*LOKI

Kali, I look forward to our time together. I wonder how I'll be able to break your spirit just as much as the farmer has, but I'm sure I'll find a way.

CAIN and LOKI exit.

Beat.

*KALI

Don't dare judge me.

*PROMETHEUS

You're letting your baser emotions become you, Doctor.

*KALI

I...I'm surviving, Prometheus. Here we are, trapped with a pack of rabid wolves, for who knows how long, and you think you have the right to analyze my actions?

*PROMETHEUS

If not me, then who?

*KALI

I am only behaving in such a drastic manner, because of whom we are trapped with and what titles we hold. They see this as their chance to punish us for our healing techniques, and I refuse to be a receptacle for their fury. If we were different individuals, or if we were in different surroundings, we would act accordingly.

*PROMETHEUS

I know who I am. I am me, no matter what my surroundings are. This is how a caring, respectable individual should act in their times of hardship. This is how you should act.

*KALI

You're a fool.

KALI and PROMETHEUS move to different corners to ponder over their situation. PERSEPHONE slithers in on her belly.

*PERSEPHONE

Two in pain. Two in vain. Add me as your third. I promise you will never feel so agonizingly blissful than when forcing me to live out your pain. Please, share with me your total despair. Drown me in it. Press me against your inner demons and let them tear me limb from limb from limb from limb. Don't spare me your wrath. Defeat me in any way you wish. Let me be the vice you allow yourself to pass the time with.

Beat.

*PERSEPHONE

Prometheus...?

*PROMETHEUS

Hmm? I'm sorry. I was distracted by...well, by something unpleasant.

*PERSEPHONE

Is it contagious?

*PROMETHEUS

It seems to be.

*PERSEPHONE

Touch me. Spit upon me. Bleed on my wounds. Give me this disease and infect me with undiscovered pains.

*PROMETHEUS

Persephone, although I may be trapped here with you, I am still your doctor, and I will always treat you with respect.

*KALI

Give her what she wants.

*PROMETHEUS

Pardon me?

*KALI

Of all our patients, she is the one to make the least progress. Maybe, just maybe if you give her the pain she constantly begs for, she might realize the error of her ways.

*PERSEPHONE

Yes!

*PROMETHEUS

Persephone, calm down. Doctor, I cannot believe what I am hearing.

*KALI

Honesty?

*PROMETHEUS

Indifference.

*KALI

I will not pretend to care for my patients when I am at their mercy.

*PROMETHEUS

It is no different here than when we are elsewhere.

*KALI

Truly? When in my office, I can bind the patient down to a chair, shock them with electrodes to reverse their brainwaves, or even force down beneficial medication down their throats. I dare you to try any of those in our current surroundings.

*PERSEPHONE

Please try.

*KALI

Oh shut up, you attention whore!

*PROMETHEUS

Doctor Kali, I find that you are acting severely unprofessional. Although I do not wish to sound as if I am issuing threats, our annual evaluation of each other is not too distant from now, and however you act down in these confines will be written in the permanent record.

*KALI

Perhaps I should no longer work for this department.

*PROMETHEUS

If you can't find it within yourself to open your heart to our patients when you no longer have the power to confine and punish them, then I will have to agree with you.

*KALI

If we ever escape here.

*PERSEPHONE

I know of a way.

*KALI

A way to what?

*PERSEPHONE

Escape. I know of a way.

*PROMETHEUS

She might be lying.

*KALI

She might not. Persephone, how do we escape from here?

*PERSEPHONE

Why would you ever want to leave here? This is the only place in the world where hope means absolutely nothing to those unable to change their natures. It's eternal punishment, but only for a select few. Like me. Like the others. Maybe like you.

KALI walks over to PERSEPHONE and violently grabs and shakes her.

*KALI

Tell me! Tell me how to escape here!

*PROMETHEUS

Unhand her, now!

*KALI

Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you in ways these Neanderthals could never think of.

PROMETHEUS forcibly shakes PERSEPHONE out of KALI's grasp.

*PROMETHEUS

Enough!

*PERSEPHONE

I'll tell you. But...you have to promise me something first.

*PROMETHEUS

Don't give into her demands, Dr. Kali.

*KALI

What is it?

*PERSEPHONE

I only want you two to go. No one else.

*KALI

Why?

*PERSEPHONE

This is my heaven. My nirvana. My sanctuary. Pain is everywhere, and it washes over me like a warm bloody bath every day. I look to the left, pain. I look to the right, more pain. If you take me and the others away, what will I do? Just lie to them. Tell them they are going. Their disappointment from staying here will be a wash of razors to my spirit. I won't give out our secret. I promise.

*PROMETHEUS

Persephone...I--

*KALI

Agreed.

*PERSEPHONE

I'll go run and tell the others to come. Wait here. This will be so beautiful.

PERSEPHONE exits.

*KALI

What's the problem? They can't leave here. They're unwell. I'm willing to lie to them if it means my safety.

*PROMETHEUS

Survival first. Is that all we are?

*KALI

It's all I am, Dr. Prometheus. For as long as I'm trapped down here, that's what I am.

Beat.

*PERSEPHONE (OS)

Come on and follow me! Return to the foreigners of our abysmal pleasures! They have uplifting news for our sundered ways!

Enter LOKI, CAIN, SET, YMIR, PERSEPHONE, and VENUS.

*LOKI

Doctors, tsk-tsk-tsk. Our appointment doesn't start until later. Are you trying to reschedule?

*SET

Shut your mouth, Loki. Perhaps they're wanting to beg us all at once to leave them unbroken.

*KALI

I can assure you, I'm not. It is not merely my survival which is at stake, but all of yours. I can help us escape.

*YMIR

Don't care if you can leave. I won't let you.

*VENUS

Calm down. I think the doctors are offering us all a chance to leave here. Is that correct, Doctor Kali? Is that what you're offering?

*KALI

I am.

*CAIN

Prometheus, what do you say about this?

*KALI

He agrees. We'll take you all with us. But you have to aid us, or else no one leaves.

Beat.

*LOKI

I'll help. Besides, if it doesn't work, it will be hilarious to see you fail at something.

*SET

Are you trying to deceive us, Dr. Kali?

*VENUS

She might be, but I'm curious. If there is a way out of here, then they'd be the one's to know it.

*SET

It's possible.

*CAIN

We'll do it.

*KALI

Good! Good. Persephone...continue as we discussed. You begin, and then the rest of us will follow.

*SET

Why does the pathetic, low-bred masochist get to rule over the rest of us?

*YMIR

Quiet. Listen.

*PERSEPHONE

Okay, so the way this starts is that we all huddle together in the middle.

Half-beat.

*PERSEPHONE

We all huddle together in the middle. There we go. Close, close. So close you can feel the burn of another's unwanted touch against your quivering skin.

*SET

This is stupid.

*VENUS

Then move close to me. I'm not allowing your phobias to keep us from escaping.

*CAIN

And what about Tiamat? Shouldn't she be here too?

*PERSEPHONE

Uhm...

*KALI

No. There's not enough room for her. She's a lost cause, anyhow.

*PROMETHEUS

You have truly abandoned all your sensibilities.

*KALI

Be quiet. You're breaking her concentration, Doctor.

*PERSEPHONE

Okay, and we're all close together? Yes, good. Now, we all look up where the light turns on, and we scream at the top of our lungs!

*VENUS

What do we scream, dear?

*PERSEPHONE

Anything! If it's loud, then the machines will hear, think we're fighting, and then they'll take us all up.

*SET

You're all morons.

*CAIN

Do it anyway, Set. What else were you going to do with your time?

*SET

Fine. Scream anything?

*PERSEPHONE

Yes. Now, one, two, three--

ALL scream random profanities at the ceiling except for PROMETHEUS. This goes on for a while, and then suddenly the overhead light turns on.

SFX: A more elegant alarm; not rough, but more white room.

ALL stop screaming.

*COMPUTER (OV)

Error. Error. Foreign subjects found in containment area. You are to remain within the light and will be returned to their designations. Any patients hindering this process will be completely eliminated. Do not fight the process, and this will all be over very soon. Thank you for cooperating.

SFX: A rising high pitched ringing.

*PERSEPHONE

Eliminated?

*VENUS

Run!

YMIR, CAIN, SET, VENUS, PERSEPHONE, and LOKI look terrified and one by one scramble away and EXIT.

*KALI

You see, Doctor Prometheus?! It worked! Their simple mentalities are so easily manipulated. We are the superior beings here, and this will not be a day soon forgot!"

PROMETHEUS does not respond verbally. Instead, HE looks quite disappointed and eerily calm.

BLACKOUT

END ACT II, SCENE III

ACT II, SCENE IV

The same waiting room as before.

KALI is waiting at the table. SHE is nursing her wounds and anxiously awaiting for anyone to enter the room.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

*COMPUTER (OV)

Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Please be complacent as our doctor enters to examine you. Thank you for cooperating.

*KALI

Good. I've waiting long enough for a medical doctor's examination of my wounds.

PROMETHEUS enters with a notepad.

*PROMETHEUS

Hello, Doctor Kali. How are you feeling?

*KALI

I'm feeling pain. Are you here to examine me?

*PROMETHEUS

Actually, I've already finished examining you.

Half-beat.

*KALI

Explain yourself.

*PROMETHEUS

Alright. Doctor Kali, first allow me to apologize for the subterfuge. I'm not one to endorse lying, but in this special case, I felt it was very necessary.

*KALI

What did you lie about?

*PROMETHEUS

I...well...

*KALI

Explain yourself!

*PROMETHEUS

There was never an error with the computer. Tiamat did indeed escape her bounds, but only under strict supervision. It was foreseen she would strike out against you and myself, and doorways were open for her to follow through with us as cargo. She was transported back to the examination rooms with the patients on purpose.

Beat.

*PROMETHEUS

Doctor Kali, we have been examining you. Your mental health. After I submitted my worries about your deteriorating condition to our superiors, they investigated your personal life. They found strong evidence of you isolating yourself from any social interaction outside of work. Since your only social activities here involve controlling and sometimes even berating the patients, we had to see if you were compromised.

*KALI

You think I'm mentally defective?

*PROMETHEUS

You verbally insulted the patients and myself on a vindictive level. You physically assaulted Persephone in order to appease your own desires. You participated in selfish deception knowing full well that it would cause harm to our patients' treatment. This test was your last chance at proving some potential for self-rehabilitation. You failed.

KALI screams with rage as she rushes over to PROMETHEUS, grabs HIM by the shirt, and throws HIM on the table.

SFX: the alarms sound off.

*KALI

You lied to me?! Treated me like a filthy patient! Stuck me in there with the animals and made me run through your little maze? And I'm the defective one?

*COMPUTER (OV)

Warning, warning. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Patient Kali, please comply. All patients must immediately lie flat on the ground and await assistance. Resistance will only result in damaging yourself. Thank you for cooperating.

*PROMETHEUS

Please. Let me go, Dr. Kali.

KALI chews back HER rage, knowing full well what happens to patients who disobey.

*PROMETHEUS

Computer, disengage warning.

SFX: A soft elevator "ding".

*COMPUTER (OV)

Disengaging.

*KALI

Why? Why didn't you even try to talk to me?

*PROMETHEUS

I did. You weren't listening. I'm not comfortable doing this. You were my colleague. But you have a problem. You're being committed as a patient until further notice.

KALI moves to attack PROMETHEUS, but refrains. HER rage is so hot, one can almost feel it yards away.

*PROMETHEUS

I do truly hope that you can become better in time. I'm sorry I failed to save you in time. Goodbye, Dr. Kali.

PROMETHEUS exits. KALI yells again, tipping over the table in HER rage. SHE yells at the sky, beats the chair against the floor, and swings at invisible obstacles. At the last of it, SHE kneels on the ground and cries at the futility of HER situation. SHE beats the ground as SHE lays HER head down on the ground.

BLACKOUT

END ACT II, SCENE IV

ACT II, SCENE V

In the oubliette.

KALI is sitting by HERSELF in the center of the darkness. SHE is silent and still.

Eventually, LOKI enters. HE walks over to KALI and sits next to HER.

*LOKI

We all went through this. Denial. We thought, "How could this be? How could I be abandoned by all the people I loved and left in this dark hole at the bottom of the abyss?" You start to re-evaluate people. Your friends, your family, your enemies, your pets...They don't make any sense anymore. Without them, you have to figure out who you are. The new you. So, are you Kali, the spirit-broken slave who'll abandon her rage and become a shinning beacon of healing light? Or are you going to admit to what you really are; Kali, a monster in the dark?

Beat.

*LOKI

Don't try to rush it. You'll answer when you're ready. But I'll tell you this: signs point to the latter. So please, don't act surprised when you get there. That's just tacky.

SET and VENUS enter.

*SET

(to VENUS) Why would you ever wish to be my queen slave? I'm above you. I will not lay with a servant.

*VENUS

You have so much pride. It'll all pass when you feel my warmth against your own, and then you'll beg me to let you call me your queen slave.

*SET

(to LOKI) What game are you playing this time, clown?

*LOKI

Hmm? No game. Just chatting.

SET kneels down and looks closely into KALI's eyes.

*SET

She's not there. Not even enough to beat for pleasure. Not yet.

*LOKI

Oh, I'm patient.

*VENUS

You mean you are a patient.

*LOKI

Touché.

*VENUS

Set, I don't want to play our body games anymore. I want to stay here with Kali. And Loki.

*SET

I will not stay here with the mute and the clown. My time is more precious.

*VENUS

Then leave.

Half-beat.

*SET

I'll stay. I chose to stay.

SET decides to sit down amongst the group and look out into the darkness as KALI does.

*LOKI

I wonder how long it will take.

*VENUS

Until what?

*LOKI

Until she calls herself one of us.

*SET

Not long.

*LOKI

Good. For now, the card game. How about...We Are Legion?

VENUS and SET makes sounds of disgust.

*LOKI

Novices.

*VENUS

Seven Spentas?

*SET

No. We will play Dragon's Teeth.

*LOKI

Again?

*SET

Yes, again. No one won the game last time. You and Cain fought like drunken plebes and ruined the game.

*LOKI

Uh, yeah. What's different now?

*SET

Cain isn't playing.

*LOKI

Good point. I'll get the cards.

LOKI exits.

*VENUS

This will end very badly for all of us.

*SET

Except for me.

*VENUS

Especially for you.

LOKI enters with the cards and wooden nickels.

*LOKI

I have them. I'm dealing.

LOKI deals out the cards and SET and VENUS separate the wooden nickels. LOKI gives cards in front of KALI as if SHE's playing.

*SET

Kali cannot play. Her mind is elsewhere.

*LOKI

I don't know. Move her cards for her. We need four players.

*SET

Then I'll have an unfair advantage against the both of you?

*VENUS

Unless she can move the cards on her own. Kali, care to play with us?

CAIN enters and hides to the side of the STAGE. There is a long pause, in which KALI slowly moves towards the cards and picks them up. This moment, this very simple moment, it's euphoric for CAIN. The final symptom of HER submission has come to pass, and CAIN knows that SHE is broken. HE can't stop smiling.

*LOKI

I guess she can play her own hand.

*SET

It doesn't matter. Upper hand or no, I will defeat you all.

LOKI, SET, VENUS, and KALI continue to play the game. CAIN slowly walks over, apparently unseen by the OTHERS, and speaks to KALI.

*CAIN

Darkness has become you. For all your hatred and cruel philosophy, you can no longer deny that in the end, you're one of us. Welcome to hell.

CAIN stands up and EXITS. LOKI, SET, VENUS, and KALI continue to play the card.

Beat.

*LOKI

So anything new with any of you?

*SET

Cadmus throws the stone.

*LOKI and VENUS

Long live King Leonidus!

Beat.

*LOKI

Anything? No? Okay then.

Beat.

*SET

I told you I would win this game.

BLACKOUT.

END ACT II, SCENE V

END OF PLAY.
