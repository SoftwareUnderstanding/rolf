A screenplay

FADE IN

EXT. ANGELS SINGING IN THE HEAVENS -- SUNRISE

Invisible angels fly through the clouds.

SFX wordless, SIRENIC SOUNDS of angelic voices are heard.

ANGELIC VOICES

Ooooooooo!

All angelic sound and motion ends, abruptly, at a WALL of DARKNESS.

EXT. EMERGENCE OF THE MOON

SILENCE pervades the darkness.

From a pin-prick in the darkness, a piercing point of LIGHT emerges. It pools to form the Moon.

The Moon is a mere spot shrouded by the darkness.

A narrow beam of moonlight shoots down slicing the darkness.

EXT. BURNING OF THREE WITCHES -- LATE EVENING

This narrow beam of moonlight spotlights THREE WITCHES who are tied to a series of stakes on a platform in the plaza in front of a medieval cathedral.

Faggots are piled high about them.

A SHADOWY FIGURE rushes forth and casts a torch upon the thrushes.

Flames burst across the screen.

SHOUTS and CURSES are heard as the faces of the Three Witches are seen. The first is a very ancient face. The second a middle-aged mother. The third, a beauteous youth with eyes of pure innocence.

CROWD #1

(inebriated and flailing a flask)

Burn in hell, you shriveled old hags!

CROWD #2

(holding up a crucifix)

God forgive you for your terrible sins!

A PEASANT WOMAN pushes and pulls her HUSBAND away from the mob and up to the edge of the fire.

He is sickly and acts insanely. She pleads with the Three Witches,

CROWD #3

(pointing to her husband)

Please God and take your spell off my husband!

THE THREE WITCHES

Though the flames surround the witches their eyes reflect calm.

As the crowd's condemning voices are heard, the Three Witches gaze peacefully and assuringly at one another.

The crowd goes berserk as the flames jump on and set the gowns of the Three Witches on fire.

EXT. PROCESSION -- CONTINUOUS

A YOUNG ACOLYTE, holding aloft a pendulous and gruesome

crucifix, leads the BISHOP who is followed by a line of

HOODED MONKS.

The monks pray, strike their breasts, and elicit a collective low funereal CHANT in Latin, the "DIES IRAE," whose MOANING tone hypnotically snares the crowd.

CHANT

Dies irae,

Dies illae ...

Twice, the Bishop and monks process around the pyre.

THE BISHOP

All attention is snared and bedlam restrained by the BOOMING VOICE of the Bishop. He is quoting Exodus 22:18.

BISHOP

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

This scriptural verse is picked up and repetitively intoned by the crowd. The crowds sways as one as it chants.

CROWD

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

As the flames reach higher and begin to engulf the Three Witches, the Bishop intones this scriptural injunction over and over, with each repetition rising louder and louder until he is screaming.

BISHOP

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

When the flames leap onto the witches' gowns, bedlam breaks loose.

People pull their hair. Some push and slap others.

Others fall to their feet, stunned and speechless. The crowd is possessed.

FULL SHOT

The faces and skin of the Three Witches do not burn.

Their eyes are determined, peaceful and longing.

A TITLE APPEARS OVER BLACK.

1499, Germany

Cologne Cathedral

INT. JACOBUS SPRENGER, O.P. -- EVENING

A huge crowd at Mass is held spellbound by the preacher, JACOBUS SPRENGER. He is a tall and ruggedly handsome priest in his late 40s. His thick, raven hair is fully tonsured in the style of the Dominican friars.

But it is his eyes which dominate his face. They are deep, tar pools of mysterious darkness reflecting a "hell fire and brimstone" intensity.

From a high PULPIT, Sprenger thunders. He accentuates his sermon with pounding fists.

With each THUMP, the massive Bible bounces up and down.

SPRENGER

(reading from the Bible)

"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the pit and shut it and sealed it over him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were ended."

He raises his eyes, leans over and speaks just above a whisper. His eyes are wild and on fire. His voice is eerie.

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

We are half-way there. Five hundred years to chain the Devil -- to purge and purify this wretched Earth from all Satan's demons, all the witches, all the Jews, Mohammedeans, and every protesting heretic!

He stands erect and says with raised hands.

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

Witches all!

His words echo to STILLNESS.

Then, he turns towards the altar, and with arms raised up to heaven he proclaims,

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

Oh, but a ray of millennial hope has shined on us, shined on us oh God, Mighty Father, on us your prodigal and filthy children! It is the hope of the New World, so blessedly discovered by your faithful son Columbus.

Sprenger reaches down and raises a book high above his head.

THE "MALLEUS MALEFICARUM"

As he turns back towards the congregation, the book's title is clearly seen, "MALLEUS MALEFICARUM."

So are the names of its authors, JACOBUS SPRENGER, O.P. and HEINRICH KRAEMER, O.P.

Sprenger turns and nods towards his co-author, Kraemer, who is seated in a chair of honor beside the altar.

HEINRICH KRAEMER is a tonsured Dominican like Sprenger. He is shorter, in his early 30s with a baby-face, blond hair and soft blue eyes.

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

(waving the "Malleus")

This is "The Hammer of Satan." Armed with this, Satan and all his savages will be purged and indeed the world will be made New.

Then he extends his right arm out to full length and points towards the congregation as he holds the "MALLEUS" with his left and indicts:

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

"All witchcraft comes from carnal lust ... which is in women insatiable!"

WIDER VIEW

shows congregation beating their breasts, and women drawing veils over their heads and bowing low.

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

Insatiable!

Again, his words echo to STILLNESS.

Then with a voice of hope and a ring of victory he shouts,

SPRENGER (CONT'D)

Five hundred years! Tis allotted for us to purge the Old and purify the New World -- NO MORE WITCHES, NO MORE SORCERY!

FULL SHOT OF STATUE OF "THE PIETA"

As Sprenger shouts, "No more witches, no more sorcery!" he turns towards a side-altar.

There, the "PIETA" -- Michelangelo's statue of Mary receiving the body of Jesus from the Cross -- is seen.

FULL SHOT

Mary's long-suffering face fills the screen. Her face and eyes are identical to the youngest of the Three Witches.

SPRENGER (O.S.)

Purge! For the Virgin! Purge!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHRINE OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, WASHINGTON, D.C. --NIGHT

"Purge!" echoes and Mary's face fill the screen for several moments when suddenly her face shatters.

WIDER VIEW

shows the inside of a great cathedral. The only light is moonlight falling through the numerous stain glass windows.

In the semi-darkness, a dozen SKI-MASKED FIGURES scramble

about.

They bump into pews and one another as they feverishly rush from side-altar to side-altar.

SERIES OF SHOTS OF SIDE-ALTARS OF MARY

Each side-altar contains an image of Mary as revered by a distinct culture. The altar's TITLE and ORIGIN appear as sub-titles.

A) Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico

B) Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage, Philippines

C) Our Lady of Mariazell, Austria

D) Our Lady of Vailankanni, India

E) Our Lady of Bistrica, Croatia

F) Our Lady of Africa, Africa

G) Our Lady of Lourdes, France

H) The Pieta, Italy

The Ski-Masked Figures smash, deface and burn these images.

As they destroy, the words "Purge" and "Purgare" are shouted and spray-painted over the statues.

DESTROYER #1

Purge!

DESTROYER #2

Purgare!

As this scene ends a TITLE appears over black:

August 15, 1999

BACK TO SCENE

The TV Reporter is staggered and baffled.

TV REPORTER (O.S.)

The only message is the word "Purge!"

FULL SHOT

of the defaced PIETA and the spray-painted words, "PURGE!" and "PURGARE!"

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

The TV Reporter walks over to a monitor.

As he speaks, footage of destruction at other sites is shown.

TV REPORTER (CONT'D)

Around the world, major shrines and statues of other goddess figures were destroyed last night.

BACK TO SCENE

As the reporter speaks, IMAGES of

a) the Pope,

b) a gathering of archaeologists, and

c) the Venus of Willendorf are shown.

TV REPORTER

The Pope has issued a plea for calm while bolstering security around the world.

Leaders of all religions are dismayed. Archaeologists around the world have pleaded for special protection of the Venus of Willendorf -- one of the most ancient and most revered of symbols, curiously not attacked.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CLASSROOM. BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY -- DAY

FULL SHOT

of the TV image of the Venus of Willendorf comes into focus on a projector screen.

CRAMER (O.S.)

What did this goddess Venus represent?

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

PROFESSOR HENRY CRAMER walks up to the screen and TAPS the Venus with a pointer.

HENRY CRAMER is in his late 20s, with blond hair, baby-face and blue eyes. He is the spitting image of Heinrich Kraemer.

As he pauses before the slide, at bottom, a TITLE appears.

Professor Henry Cramer

Archaeologist and Theologian

Brigham Young University

Professor Cramer turns towards his students.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

The world sees her as fecundity, as the cause of full harvests -- note the cornucopian breasts! -- even as the fullness of sexuality --

(pauses)

this belly, big enough for Jonah and the Whale!

Cramer laughs as does his students. This touch of humor quickly turns serious.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

But what is she to us? As scientists who have the revelations of our Mormon heritage?

"DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS"

He picks up a large scriptural book whose title is clearly seen: "DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS."

As he reads he becomes "fire and brimstone" like the monk, Jacobus Sprenger.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

From "Doctrine and Covenants" as revealed through Joseph Smith. "For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the Earth is ripe; and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble and I will burn them up ..."

(pauses)

AND I WILL BURN THEM UP!

His eyes burn the words into his students.

WIDER VIEW

shows several of his student shiver and act like they are on fire.

BACK TO SCENE

Cramer paces around the front of the room as he reads.

CRAMER

AND I WILL BURN THEM UP! -- "saith the Lord of Hosts that wickedness shall not be upon the Earth; for the hour is nigh and that which was spoken of mine Apostles must be fulfilled, for as they spoke so shall it come to pass; for I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with all the hosts thereof and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand years and the wicked will not stand."

THE WASATCH RANGE OF MOUNTAINS

By the end, he has walked about and over to a window with a full view of the majestic Wasatch Range.

Cramer is momentarily snared in a minor rapture.

In b.g. the students are stone silent.

Cramer abruptly turns and walks to his desk.

He lays down the book and shuffles some papers. He is professorial and dismissive, hurrying to end class.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Desecrations are not necessary! What is necessary is that wickedness be burned from your memory, burned from your hearts.

He picks up his "Doctrines and Covenants" and THUMPS it. He becomes intense, again.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Read and read and read, my brothers and sisters! The Millennium -- these words are the fire! Our rituals will cleanse us! ... Be pure! Be pure.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

The class bell RINGS.

The students rise and file out.

As the students leave, most smile and nod at Cramer. It is apparent that they hold him in awe.

1ST STUDENT

Lead us, Professor Cramer.

One, at the head of a group of four, comes intimately close as if trading a secret.

2ND STUDENT

(conspiratorially)

Will we be praying tonight?

Cramer gives him a non-verbal eyed "Yes."

3RD STUDENT

(rapt)

All will be glorious!

INT. AREN -- CONTINUOUS

AREN is a student, early 20s, with stunning long black hair. She is Cramer's fiance. She pauses at the classroom door as the other students file pass.

Cramer walks up to her.

They smile, hold hands and leave quietly.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOONLIT HILL -- EVENING

Aren and Cramer cuddle and lean against a tree.

CRAMER

On Mission I learned the true spiritual value of Mormon Women.

Aren looks adoringly at him. She is taken and in love.

He twirls her forward so that they are face to face. Then he "testifies." His desire for her is ardent, however, it is abstract.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

You are so pure!

I've seen Catholics, Muslims, black and brown, pagans ... but you "Mormon Woman" are so pure!

Aren's words are hot, with an edge of seduction.

AREN

All for you, darling.

He does not hear her. He plows forward.

Cramer

Next to me, my Mormon Woman! No priest, no rabbi has ... no one can purify the world. Oh, darling, sweet Aren ... how pure your are, how pure you make me!

Together, we will be gods ... you my Mother-in-Heaven.

Aren is beside herself, totally turned on, a sexual tinder about to blast afire by his touch or kiss.

Cramer's eyes reveal how far away his is; how snared by something from beyond.

AREN

(breathlessly)

When, just say when!

CRAMER

THE MILLENNIUM! How lucky we are; how blessed!

He grips her shoulders. Unaware, he hurts her. She whimpers.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

(commanding)

We must remain pure! The pure of the pure.

Aren is stunned by the fierceness behind his words.

AREN

You've changed!

CRAMER

No, transformed ... Revelation!

(whispers)

"The Three Nephites!"

She looks askance.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Yes. Yes, They have appeared to the First Presidency ... only rumor, but I know, I know.

Aren struggles to bring the conversation to a more practical level.

AREN

Hank. Twelve years you and I have known.

(fingers her ring)

For two years I have waited. We must set a date.

CRAMER

Didn't you hear me?

AREN

(a tad perturbed)

Yes. Nephites. The Millennium. It's all quite exciting ... but we must get about living, our family.

CRAMER

Don't say that!

(dictatorially)

Woman obey!

His words jolt and freeze her.

She forces a resigned smile, and then moves closer to him.

His fierce stare slowly melts into tenderness.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Without you I cannot be pure. I love you. I need you.

From behind he enfolds her in his arms.

He nestles his head upon her shoulder.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

These are special times. The end of time! Soon, we will be married in eternity and as gods people the planets far and wide!

Aren nods as she forces another resigned smile.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

For now, please, darling, purify me!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAMER'S STUDY -- NIGHT

The phone rings. Cramer picks it up.

CRAMER

Do you think we can?

He hangs up the phone and rushes out into the night.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE MORMON TABERNACLE -- LATER

Cramer is speaking but only the SHADOWS of the THREE NEPHITES are seen. It is clear that Cramer cannot see the faces behind the shadows. Their voices do not reveal their gender.

NEPHITE #1

What does she know?

CRAMER

Only what I tell her.

NEPHITE #1

The Roman Beast roars. The prophecy is being fulfilled. She must go but not know.

CRAMER

Why?

NEPHITE #1

It will become evident

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WAITING AREA, THE VATICAN -- DAY

Aren and Cramer wait in a heavily baroque and religiously statuted room.

A TITLE appears: THE VATICAN, ROME.

Both Aren and Cramer are uncomfortable. Cramer paces about examining all the artwork.

Aren fidgets and squirms in a grand, medieval chair.

CRAMER

(indicating the statues)

It's worse than one's worst fear, isn't it?

AREN'S POV

Aren eyes several of the tortured and bleeding crucifixes.

BACK TO SCENE

Cramer walks about.

PAPAL PORTRAITS

He pauses to study the faces in several Papal portraits.

As shoe SCRAPES and SWISHING robes are heard, both eye the doorway.

Aren rises.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

JAMES BLAST, 0.P. enters. He is a Cardinal. Physically, he is a replica of Jacobus Sprenger. In his late 40s but his hair is not tonsured, and he sports a short but full beard streaked with grey.

BLAST'S EYES

like Sprenger's, are deep, tar pools of mysterious darkness.

As Blast approaches Cramer and Aren, he is cordial, though clearly uncomfortable. He is a mannered diplomat.

BLAST

(extending his hand)

So good to finally see you.

Cramer shakes his hand.

Aren nods and makes an awkward half-curtsey.

Blast seats them, then himself.

He points around the room.

BLAST (CONT'D)

(self-amused)

The "Whore of Babylon," yes?

Cramer is not amused. Blast reads him.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Yes, to the point. Why are we all here?

Blast taps and drums on a small side-table as he talks.

BLAST (CONT'D)

The desecrations. Terrible, yes?! Calls for united action and simply

(leans forward)

you have the best, um, second best, international network ... and we want to tap it.

CRAMER

The Lamb lies down with the Lion?

Both men laugh.

Aren is ill at ease. She is an uninformed observer.

BLAST

No one will expect us to work together. So it's perfect. Even the Mafia is suspect.

CRAMER

(acidly)

An old ally?

BLAST

I'm an American, like you, Jersey, so it doesn't rub me, yeah, an old ally.

(with Jersey accent)

But duz we's dance?

Cramer looks at Aren. He anticipates her shock at hearing,

CRAMER

They've approved a professorial exchange. He goes to BYU, I come here.

Aren's mouth drops in shock and confusion.

Blast catches the fact of her lack of knowledge. He is amused.

Taking advantage of Aren's and Cramer's personal distraction, Blast knocks Cramer off his poise and causes him to blush as he jokes.

BLAST

Such authority. Indeed, the next Mormon Pope!

Cramer's blush and consternation causes Aren to loose an inappropriate laugh.

Blast and Cramer ignore Aren as Cramer rises to the bait and with quick-wit strikes back.

CRAMER

After the white smoke, will God be calling your name?

Blast stands and reaches for his diplomatic best as he bows towards one of the tortured crucifixes on the wall. Yet his words betray his personal desire.

BLAST

Only if He desires to rule through a Fool such as I!

To move in a new direction, Blast bows towards Aren.

Blast then surprises her by calling for her hand on his arm.

She rises and walks with him into the adjourning room.

Cramer follows.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. A VATICAN LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS

They enter a library. The walls are crammed with art.

ROW OF PAPAL PORTRAITS

Blast's guides them silently down a row of papal portraits.

Cramer and Aren are as reserved as one is in a museum as they observe the stolid faces and the pomp of the papal office.

PAINTINGS

They walk past several MADONNA WITH CHILD PAINTINGS.

Aren smiles admiringly. Cramer raises his eyebrows.

GORY, BAROQUE CRUCIFIXES

When Aren and Cramer encounter a series of Baroque, flesh-

ripped and gory crucifixes, they look at each other with eyes that say, "Sick!"

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Blast stops at the end of the corridor.

With a sweep of his arms indicating all the art, he says,

BLAST

To destroy such art, they must be Millennial crazies! Spiritual terrorists! But actually ...

TWO PAINTINGS

Blast pivots and points up at two paintings:

Robert Campin's "The Nativity," and

Titian's "The Assumption of the Virgin."

His eyes almost tear as he longingly gazes up at both paintings, yet his voice is harsh, condemning.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Witchcraft. It is all witchcraft, again. And it is the witches, these feminists. Believe me they are the desecrators.

Blast looks at Cramer and Aren to see if they follow his thoughts. Clearly, they don't.

So, Blast drops into a professorial tone.

BLAST (CONT'D)

"Heighten the contradictions" -- Marxists, that's what they believe. They are intentionally making things worse.

AREN

I'm not sure ...

BLAST

They want to be persecuted. They want to condemn the male, to castrate, I mean castigate the Father God. It's all this Earth Mother crap ...

Blast is more shocked then they at his slip of tongue. He quickly manages the matter.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Ahem, excuse my Jersey there!

(embarrassed humor)

Should've said it in Latin!

INT. BLAST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

They come to a door with the lettering:

CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH

A SUB-TITLE appears:

FORMERLY, THE HOLY OFFICE OF THE INQUISITION

All enter through this door into Blast's office. It is a grand room with an imposing desk and several high stacks of books.

PORTRAITS OF SPRENGER AND KRAEMER

Portraits of Sprenger and Kraemer are centered on the wall behind Blast's desk.

THE MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

Cramer walks over to a FOLIO BOOK set upon a podium.

One look and he turns to Blast.

CRAMER

The Malleus Maleficarum.

(impressed)

An original?

BLAST

Quite.

Cramer turns to Aren.

CRAMER

The Hammer of Satan. The bible of the Inquisition.

Blast draws Cramer's attention to one of the portraits behind his desk. It is of Heinrich Kraemer, O.P.

BLAST

He has been expecting you.

FULL SHOT

The portrait Blast indicates could be one of Cramer, himself.

BACK TO SCENE

Aren gasps when she catches the uncanny likeness.

CRAMER

(to Blast)

You know.

Blast nods knowingly. He works to repress a smirk.

Cramer turns to Aren who, evidently, doesn't know what they know.

CRAMER

(pointing at portrait)

A relative.

AREN'S POV

Aren walks up to the portrait and reads the brass TITLE, "HEINRICH KRAEMER, O.P."

She stands on her tip-toes for a closer study of both portraits.

She looks at Cramer and just shakes her head.

She looks at the other portrait's TITLE: JACOBUS SPRENGER, O.P.

SPRENGER AND BLAST'S EYES

Aren is visibly repulsed by Sprenger's eyes.

Then she turns and looks at Blast's eyes.

Aren is about to ask Blast a question, but he has a finger raised to his lips indicating silence.

BACK TO SCENE

Aren, then, turns towards Cramer ready to ask questions.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Don't ask. Don't worry. I've already baptized him.

BLAST

(nastily)

Ah, the famed Mormon Baptism of the Dead! Indeed, someday I too will then be Mormon?

Blast's words chill the moment.

To break the ice Aren feigns interest in the "Malleus." She walks over and turns a page.

AREN

Tell me more.

CRAMER

Oh, no, I don't think.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Blast walks over and stands beside Aren.

He thumbs through the "Malleus" to a part he wants to read.

With the condescension of a haughty teacher, he says with a slight mocking tone.

BLAST

A goddess like you might elucidate this passage for an old celibate like me.

With an underlying testy "Fly demon!" tone he reads,

BLAST (CONT'D)

"William of Paris notes that night-time Demons seem chiefly to molest women and girls with beautiful hair ..."

He gives her head a fatherly pat. She is frozen.

BLAST (CONT'D)

"either because they devote themselves too much to the care and adornment of their hair or because they are wont to try to excite men by means of their hair ..."

Cramer steps over and closes the book. He glares at Blast.

CRAMER

Enough foolishness! Let's conclude our business ... as distasteful as I anticipate it to be.

Blast works a diplomatic smile.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PAPAL DINING ROOM -- EVENING

Cramer and Aren are seated at the middle of a long, medieval dining table. Setting is high-class, glittering silver, etc.

All except Cramer and Aren are Roman Catholic clerics. Several Cardinals are present, including the white-bearded CARDINAL BONIFACI, Head of Vatican Security, who sits next to Cramer.

Blast rises to propose a toast.

He nods towards Cramer.

BLAST

God's ways are mysterious!

Then Blast addresses the full assembly.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Two historic events. First, to the success of our brother, Professor Cramer, who next month will teach for the fall semester at the Gregorianum. And I in return will journey -- should I say pilgrimage? -- to Salt Lake City.

The toast is drunk. Blast continues.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Now, of even greater import. To the reunion of two brothers in the faith.

(indicates Cramer)

The descendant of our beloved Heinrich Kraemer,

(bows indicating himself)

and the unworthy descendant of the glorious Jacobus Sprenger!

Aren is shocked by this fact. Cramer turns toward her,

CRAMER

(whispers)

The portrait, his eyes! "Blast" is an Americanization of Sprenger. Probably during World War One.

Then Blast waves for the SERVANTS to refill the glasses.

Once refilled, Blast bows towards Aren.

BLAST

Less we prove ourselves unmanly --

Blast and all the men raise their glasses.

BLAST (CONT'D)

a toast to Beauty, to the Queen of Heaven resplendent among us in the blush of most charming youth!

Aren blushes. She is embarrassed and speechless.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BLAST'S BEDROOM WINDOW -- EVENING

Blast stands at his bedroom window. He is holding an ancient hand-held, folding telescope.

He scans the horizon.

BLAST'S POV

He spies Cramer and Aren in the distance.

EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE -- EVENING

Cramer and Aren are holding hands and strolling around the fountain in St. Peter's Square.

It is a "Lover's Evening" of August splendor: full-moon, etc.

Like the Young Lovers they are, they walk and play.

He twirls her around.

They kiss.

She dances around the fountain.

He chases her and holds her in his arms.

INT. BLAST'S BEDROOM WINDOW -- CONTINUOUS

Blast watches Aren and Cramer kiss.

He quickly scans in another direction.

He is searching for someone or something.

EXT. BLAST'S POV -- CONTINUOUS

The SHADOW of a figure is seen.

It darts in and out of doorways and shadowed areas.

The Shadow lifts a pair of binoculars.

SHADOW'S POV

He watches Cramer and Aren stroll about.

BACK TO SCENE

Blast watches the Shadow watching Aren and Cramer.

INT. BLAST'S BEDROOM WINDOW -- CONTINUOUS

Blast drops the telescope and continues to stare out the window.

He folds the telescope.

He smiles like a satisfied cat as he walks towards his bed.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AREN & CRAMER'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER

Cramer kisses Aren goodnight by her hotel room door.

They are both passionate but restrained.

Aren pulls him closer. She becomes sexually bolder.

Cramer initially responds, but then backs off, panting.

He back-steps across the corridor to his hotel room.

He takes out his key.

They gaze at each other, frozen in desire.

CRAMER

Soon, sweet Aren, soon.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAMER'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER

Cramer stands at a window.

He looks up at the star-filled heavens.

He checks his watch. It shows that it is midnight.

He turns and leaves the room.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHRISTIAN CATACOMBS -- EARLY A.M.

STREET-SIGN

Cramer is under a street-sign which points to the "CHRISTIAN CATACOMBS."

He crosses the street and pauses in the recess of the cathedral which is the entrance to the catacombs.

His eyes show that he senses someone, and he turns.

CRAMER AND THE THREE NEPHITES

From the shadows, the Three Nephites speak.

NEPHITE #1 (O.S.)

Rome is called The Eternal City. Can you understand why?

CRAMER

No. Not really. Why am I here?

NEPHITE #2 (O.S.)

It will become evident.

NEPHITE #3 (O.S.)

Aren must leave.

Cramer is about to ask "Why?" but hesitates and breathes an obedient,

CRAMER

Okay.

Nephite #1 hands a packet to Cramer. Nephite #1's hand is not exposed. It is covered by the robe's sleeve.

Cramer makes a hurried examination of the packet.

He is perplexed.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Why this Venus? Why me?

NEPHITE #1 (O.S.)

She is for The Celebration. For the End Time ceremony.

HAND-HELD DEVICE

Nephite #2 hands Cramer a hand-held device.

Cramer quickly examines it.

He shakes his head in recognition of what the device is.

NEPHITE #2 (O.S.)

Your Special Forces training has prepared you for this.

Cramer gives an accepting nod.

NEPHITE #3 (O.S.)

In this City, Satan is enthroned. Beware.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING

Aren and Cramer's bags are packed.

She sits at the edge of the bed with a handkerchief in her hand.

He paces.

She sniffles and starts to cry.

CRAMER

Enough! Enough!

Aren stands, goes to a mirror and arranges her hair.

Aren finishes and is about to pick up her suitcase, when she stops, turns towards Cramer and says,

AREN

1999, yes, I believe you, it is 666 the sign of Satan upside down. But, Hank, the Millennium, I've listened to you, hear yourself, "God is not a slave to human reckoning," how many times have you taught and preached that?

Cramer comes over and hugs her.

CRAMER

You are so pure!

(paternally)

My sweetheart, more has been revealed than I can tell you.

(indicating Rome)

God wants me here in the Belly of the Beast. There is a reason for Blast -- that minion of the anti-Christ! -- that perverted offspring of that hideous torturer Sprenger --to come to BYU ... just understand ...

SFX Cramer's words are shattered by GUNSHOTS.

A mirror EXPLODES and several bullets ping off the furniture.

Cramer protectively shoves Aren to the ground.

As fast as it started so it stops.

Carefully, Cramer crawls towards the window and peeks out.

EXT. THE STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

CRAMER'S POV

Cramer sees several cars on fire.

Then a SKI-MASKED FIGURE runs across the street towards the

hotel and pitches a rock which flies straight at Cramer.

He ducks.

INT. THE ROCK -- CONTINUOUS

SFX the rock CRASHES through the window into their room.

Cramer and Aren are frozen in fear; stupefied.

On the rock is painted, "PURGARE!"

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- LATER

Police are talking with Cramer as Blast and Cardinal Bonifaci enter the room.

Blast quickly scans the room. He is shocked and dismayed.

Blast sees Aren, off to the side, sitting on the bed's back edge.

Aren rocks to and fro in a distressed manner.

BLAST

(blesses himself)

God have mercy! Has the world gone totally insane?

(to Cramer)

What are these terrorists after?

Cramer shows Blast the rock and points to the word -- "PURGARE!"

Cardinal Bonifaci reaches for and snatches the rock from Cramer. Blast is bemused. He says to Cramer,

BLAST

The Cardinal considers himself the Vatican's Sherlock Holmes!

Cramer smiles wanly as he grabs Blast's arm and moves him to a distant spot where the police can't hear them. However, Aren hears them.

CRAMER

Latin. Who but Catholics would use Latin?

BLAST

Precisely. But isn't this obviously a bit of mis-direction?

Cramer is only half-convinced.

CRAMER

It may be other than you thought!

Aren stands and speaks to both of them.

AREN

(anguished)

Maybe it's me.

Blast and Cramer are both befuddled by her remark.

Aren's eyes are far off as if in a vision.

AREN (CONT'D)

Just an odd feeling. I've been praying a lot of late ...

Blast steps over and places a comforting hand on her shoulder.

BLAST

No, no my child. Don't even think ...

Cramer grasps Aren's right hand.

With his left hand, Cramer touches Aren's chin and turns her eyes away from Blast.

CRAMER

(to Blast)

It's okay. Just shock.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MEETING ROOM INSIDE A MORMON TEMPLE -- DAY

TEN WOMEN, all dressed in white, are in discussion. They range in age from college students to matrons. Aren is one.

BLACKBOARD

In b.g. on a blackboard is written in outline form,

1) Goddess/Mother-in-Heaven

2) Millennium

3) Feminism.

1ST WOMAN

(to Aren))

That is dangerous thinking!

AREN

Do you really think so? To me it's just the natural development of our Mormon Revelation.

2ND WOMAN

(enthusiastically)

Yes, if we do have parents in heaven. Then God our Father must be married to our Mother-in-heaven. Shouldn't we bring this, isn't this what our feminist sisters are looking for?

1ST WOMAN

"Sisters"? You call them sisters?

3RD WOMAN

What does it matter? All will be changed, in just a few months Jesus will return!

A gush of excitement seizes all but Aren and the 2nd Woman.

The meeting breaks down into tears and wails,

4TH WOMAN

(throwing up her arms)

Oh, Sweet Jesus, come, come!

5TH WOMAN

Eternal Father come to me!

SEVERAL OTHERS

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AREN'S BEDROOM -- LATER

Aren sits at a small desk and strokes her hair as she reads the Bible.

Then, she stands and walks about while continuing to brush her hair. She is clearly in deep thought.

SNOW FALLING

She goes over to a window and watches the snow fall.

Something disturbs her. Her face becomes agitated, frustrated and perplexed.

She walks back to the Bible.

She reads, strokes her hair, then picks-up the Bible and walks back to the window.

FULL SHOT

of REVELATIONS 12:1-2, which she has high-lighted, as she reads it out loud.

AREN (V.O.)

"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars."

(slowly, meditatively)

"And she being with child ... cried out ... in her pangs of birth ... in anguish for delivery."

Aren kneels down in prayer, and buries her face in her hands.

After a moment, she rises. Her face is enlightened.

AREN (CONT'D)

That's it! Oh ... Mother-in-Heaven!

INT. AREN KIDNAPPED -- CONTINUOUS

Just as Aren completes her sentence, THREE SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPERS break through her door.

Aren is startled. She retreats in fear but then reverses the emotion of the moment by relaxing, smiling and holding her arms out in a gesture of acceptance.

The Three Kidnappers roughly grab her and pin her to the ground.

One throws a blanket over her.

Another ties her up.

The third lifts Aren up and throws her on his shoulder.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAMER'S STUDY -- MORNING

Cramer is opening his mail.

PHOTOGRAPH

From a large manila envelope, a photograph of Aren falls out.

CRAMER'S POV OF AREN'S PICTURE

Aren is sitting on a chair with her hands tied behind her.

Her face is painted with clown white and in black across her forehead is written, "PURGE!"

BACK TO SCENE

Cramer bursts into a moment of rage, but quickly gains control of himself.

He slips off his chair and onto his knees to pray.

He holds Aren's picture, heavenward, as he prays,

CRAMER

(resigned)

I accept her role. Please strengthen me, O Father. I accept her role.

Cramer's face is determined and his eyes are afire.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KIDNAPPER'S ROOM

SPOTLIGHT

Aren, spotlighted, sits in a chair with her hands tied behind her back. She is not in pain.

"PURGE" is written across her white-faced forehead as in the picture received by Cramer.

In the twilight behind the spotlight are four kidnappers.

Of the three who captured Aren, only one removes his mask. This is FATHER O'BRIEN. He is late 30s with a thick beard which has a distinctive streak of gray in the form of a slashed scar.

O'Brien acknowledges the fourth kidnapper with a nod. This is Blast. Both slip on their ski-mask.

ARTIFICIAL VOICE BO

xBlast straps on an artificial voice box.

Aren cannot see the faces of her abductors. They speak from the shadows.

KIDNAPPER #1 (O.S.)

How can we tell that she's the one?

BLAST (O.S.)

Like the others, torture her.

At the word "torture," Aren's eyes pop out in fear. She MUMBLES a prayer.

AREN

"Our Father ..."

Kidnapper #1 hears Aren praying.

KIDNAPPER #1 (O.S.)

(eagerly)

Should I cut her tongue first?

BLAST (O.S.)

No! No, we need this one to sing.

Distraught, Aren strains to see them.

INT. AREN'S TORTURE -- CONTINUOUS

Kidnapper #1 steps forward and turns Aren's chair around.

He cuts the binds on her hands.

HIGH TECHNOLOGY DEVICES

The spotlight dims and reveals that the room is like a NASA Mission Control station, stuffed with HIGH TECHNOLOGY DEVICES.

The wall before them turns into a huge video screen.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

convey the destruction of statutes, goddess sites, and the execution and torture of women. Video footage of:

A) the destruction at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception shows the faces of Mary being shattered.

B) the destruction of goddess sites through bombings, etc.

C) a wall of photographs of women in various stages of torture and execution. Neatly arrayed under a headlined quotation, "YOU SHALL NOT PERMIT A SORCERESS TO LIVE!"

D) a collage of photographs showing Aren and Cramer in various romantic moments. The photos focus upon Aren's eyes, her hands, her lips, and, especially, her hair. This is handled very sensuously.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Aren is spun around and blinded by the spotlight, again.

She is clearly distressed. She rubs her hands, strokes her hair, etc. Her eyes convey that she is helpless and frozen in fear.

HARNESS AND SKY-HOOK

Kidnapper #1 steps forward and slips a harness over Aren.

He re-ties her hands behind her back. She is terrified.

A sky-hook swings out from the shadows.

Aren is locked in.

Then, she is hoisted up such that she is on her tip-toes.

She screams and her face is wrenched in fear.

AREN

Help me Jesus! Help me!

In a moment she quiets and starts praying,

AREN

"Our Father who art in heaven ..."

THE CANE

Blast, from the shadows, extends a long cane. It is thick, of dark ebony, and gold-tipped. It glistens like water. It shimmers, tricking the eye, making it appear to be alive!

The Cane touches Aren's lips and she stops praying.

The Cane touches her hair, strokes her cheeks, slips down around her shoulders. The Cane's molestation is highly sensuous.

Aren grimaces and suffers as she hears and is touched.

BLAST (O.S.)

(mocking as the cane strokes her breasts)

Are you the goddess? The mother whom all suck? The first food of the innocent babe?

With savage anger in his voice Blast WHACKS her breasts.

BLAST (O.S.)

Have you seduced him?

As Blast says "him," the voice of Cramer is heard.

CRAMER (V.O.)

Darling, you are so beautiful!

The whack causes Aren to bolt upright and she is, momentarily, jerked off her feet.

The CREAKS of the sky-hook and the SQUEAL of the tightening leather harness are heard.

Aren flops back and forth, grimacing in pain.

Her toes struggle to regain their balance on the ground.

She does NOT scream.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Or the first to spoil the sweet milk of God's love by offering your sinful body as food?!

The Cane slides down her back, pauses on her buttock, and

then glides down and across her hips and plunges between her

legs. The Cane "fucks" her.

BLAST (CONT'D)

(with contempt)

Mother! Goddess! Whore! Bitch! Your sucking mouth is insatiable! Insatiable!

Aren's whole body recoils and flops wildly. The noise is a chorus of the sky-hook and harness' CREAKS and SQUEALS.

Aren does NOT scream.

In great pain, her eyes roll back into her head and she feints.

INT. VISION OF THE THREE NEPHITES -- SPF

As Aren feints, a BURST of bright light washes over the screen.

Aren still sways, unconscious, on the harness.

The Three Nephites step forward from the shadows. They are hooded and their faces are not seen.

FULL SHOT

An ancient, gnarled hand slips from a robed sleeve and touches Aren's face.

BACK TO SCENE

Aren awakens.

AREN'S POV -- THE THREE NEPHITES' FACES REVEALED

One by one the Three Nephites each touch Aren's face.

As their fingers touch her their hoods fall revealing their faces. They are the faces of the Three Witches in the opening burning scene.

One Nephite is a heavily wrinkled crone.

The second is middle-aged, plump and matronly.

The third is young, virginal and peaches-and-cream innocent.

As the Third Nephite touches her cheek, Aren's eyes light up.

DROPS OF BLOOD

Then, drops of blood fall as spray upon Aren's face.

INT. END OF AREN'S TORTURE -- CONTINUOUS

Kidnapper #1 is reviving Aren by sprinkling her face with blood.

THE ASPERGILLUM

He uses the Catholic ritual aspergillum. He dips it into a bowl and then "blesses" her.

KIDNAPPER #1

This is the blood of the She Devils! All your vile sisters. Wake! Wake! You seducer of Adam, you consort of the Serpent!

He repeats this as she slowly revives.

KIDNAPPER #1 (CONT'D)

This is the blood of the She Devils! All your vile sisters. Wake! Wake! You seducer of Adam, you consort of the Serpent!

Aren wakes with a rapturous smile and loving eyes.

Blast's hand shoots out from the shadows and stops Kidnapper #1's actions.

KIDNAPPER #1 (O.S.)

(with bewilderment and fervor)

She does not curse us! Is she the one?

BLAST (O.S.)

Be patient, my friend, witches have incredible strength.

KIDNAPPER #1 (O.S.)

But ...

BLAST (O.S.)

But nothing. Yes. She has passed the first step. She may be pure.

Aren does NOT respond to the pain nor his words.

The sky-hook jerks and slackens.

Aren falls to the ground.

She is bathed by the spotlight. The edge flows like an aura.

FULL SHOT

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE MORMON TABERNACLE -- EVENING

Cramer meets with the Three Nephites. They are hooded and stand within the shadows. He cannot see them.

Cramer hands Nephite #1 Aren's "Purge!" picture.

NEPHITE #1

The time is near.

Cramer

But Aren?

NEPHITE #2

She will be returned. Say only that she is travelling.

Cramer

Then I will be alone at The End?

NEPHITE #3

It is all as it must be.

NEPHITE #1

Do not waver on this the final lap. What is dark now, will be light then.

NEPHITE #2

Fail not, for the purification is God's will.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AIRPLANE -- EARLY EVENING

Cramer looks out the window of an airplane as it lands.

The ground is snow ladened.

As he stands to leave, over the loudspeaker he hears,

STEWARDESS (V.O.)

Welcome to Vienna.

This greeting is repeated in German.

This greeting is repeated in French.

As Cramer de-planes his breath smokes the air.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TAXI RIDE -- LATER

Exiting the airport, Cramer enters a taxi.

He is driven through the festively lighted town.

Though there are skiers and others playing in the snow, Cramer is gripped by seriousness.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- LATER

Cramer unpacks in his hotel room.

He undresses and then dons dark worker clothes.

FLASHLIGHT, MAP AND HAND-HELD DEVICE

He pockets a flashlight.

He checks a map.

He slips a pair of night-goggles inside his jacket.

He flicks on and off the hand-held device the Three Nephites gave him. It projects a laser beam.

EXT. NATURHISTORISCHES MUSEUM, AUSTRIA -- LATER

Cramer steps off a trolley and walks towards a darkened building.

He stands in a darkened alcove and reads his map by moonlight.

He covertly walks down the street.

PLAQUE

He pauses under a plaque which his flashlight illuminates as, "NATURHISTORISCHES MUSEUM."

Cramer wends his way through several shadowed areas.

He stops, leans against a wall, and then flips on the hand-held laser device the Three Nephites gave him.

As he shines the laser up and down the Museum's exterior, a small red light on the device flashes.

It stays red until it hits a basement window when it goes blank.

Cramer hurries over to this window.

With a screwdriver, he jimmies it open.

He slips on a ski-mask.

Then, he crawls in.

INT. NATURHISTORISCHES MUSEUM -- CONTINUOUS

NIGHT-GOGGLES

Cramer's flashlight projects a red beam. He takes out and slips on night-goggles.

He walks confidently down a corridor.

He comes to a gate.

He scans it with the laser device. When it hits the lock, the red light flashes.

He hits a switch and a beam de-activates the lock.

Once the red light goes off, he jimmies the lock and enters.

Inside, Cramer flips another switch which sends a wide beam up and down and across the Museum room.

SECURITY CAMERA

It reveals a security camera just to his right.

Cramer flips another switch and a beam burns the camera cord.

He re-checks his map.

ALARM BOX

Then Cramer walks directly to a main alarm box.

To his astonishment it has already been turned off!

INT. CENTRAL DISPLAY: THE VENUS OF Willendorf -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer cautiously slides along the room's walls.

He is at the edge of the Central Display room.

VENUS IN A GLASS ENCLOSURE

In the center of the room, sealed within a lighted glass enclosure, is the Venus of Willendorf.

Cramer bathes the box with a laser beam.

It reveals that the Venus is surrounded by high security beams.

Just as he is about to flip another switch, the security beams go down!

Cramer hears scurrying feet and muted whispers.

He presses himself against the wall as he closely watches the Venus.

CRAMER'S POV

Three Hooded Figures appear before the Venus.

Expertly, they run a laser device along the edge.

This unglues the glass, and they take off a panel.

DUPLICATE VENUS

They bag the Venus and place a duplicate Venus inside.

They re-seal the glass box.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

STATUE OF ATHENA

As the Three Hooded Figures turn and leave, one takes out a

a hammer and smashes the face of a statue of Athena.

SIGN

He hangs fancily lettered --"PURGARE!" -- on the statue.

BACK TO SCENE

Cramer slips off his ski-mask and slumps down the wall.

CRAMER

(under his breath)

Damn!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE BLAST'S VATICAN APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

Cramer watches a building.

Blast exits the building and gets into a car and drives away.

Cramer crosses the street.

He uses his laser device to check for an unsecured entrance.

He forces an entry through a back door.

INT. BLAST'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer carefully explores Blast's apartment.

BOOKSHELVES

He runs his fingers along a line of devotionals.

TITLES are seen:

"Interior Castles" St. Teresa of Avila

"Meditations on the Life of Christ," St. Bonaventure

"Dark Night of the Soul," St. John of the Cross

"The Imitation of Christ, St. Thomas a Kempis

WITCHCRAFT

He pauses at a full array devoted to the "Malleus" and other witchcraft titles.

TITLES of witchcraft books are seen.

"Malleus Malleficarum"

"Women and the Devil"

"The Salem Witch Trials"

"History of Witchcraft"

He picks out "TORTURE AND SALVATION" by Cardinal James Blast.

As he holds it, it opens to a section: "EVE'S HAIR."

AREN'S HAIR

A long lock of ebony hair is being used as a book-marker. Cramer realizes that it is a lock of Aren's hair!

He leaves it there, closes and returns the book.

MILLENNIAL LITERATURE

Cramer then comes upon a table filled with millennial literature.

"The End Time News"

"Jesus Returns!"

"The New Eden in America"

"Voice of the Angels"

Cramer sifts through the literature.

He picks up a copy of "VOICE OF THE ANGELS."

Cramer negatively shakes his head as he reads out loud.

HEADLINE

"AVENGING ANGELS DESCEND TO SMASH AND DESTROY GODDESS IDOLS AND VILE ARTWORK OF THE GREAT HARLOT"

Cramer drops the magazine back onto the table.

PHOTOGRAPHS

A photo catches his eye. He picks it up.

It is a picture of Blast offering Mass surrounded by military guerrillas.

On the back is written, "NICARAGUA, 1983."

The eyes of one guerrilla catch his. The soldier has a full beard with a thick grey streak down the left side. It mimics a scar.

After a moment, Cramer tosses it aside and continues to search.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer opens a the top drawer of a file cabinet. It has one entry, "Mormons." It is a thick file.

He prowls through the file.

PHOTOGRAPHS

He opens a large manila envelope. Out falls pictures of him and Aren!

There are several of Aren, alone. These focus on her hair.

Cramer opens another large envelope. Out fall pictures of various goddess statues and the Venus of Willendorf.

Cramer is clearly shaken.

He returns the envelopes and closes the file.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

DESK-TOP PICTURE

As Cramer leaves he notices a desk-top picture of the grey-streaked "scar" bearded guerrilla. However, the fellow is dressed in clerical garb.

Cramer slides the photo out. On the backside it reads, "BLAST AND PURGE!"

He slips the photo back.

He hears the front door open and shut.

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer sneaks into the corridor.

He slides along the wall.

He watches Blast take off his coat and go to a door.

Blast takes out a key, unlocks and enters a private chapel.

INT. BLAST'S CHAPEL -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer sneaks down and finds a position to observe.

CRAMER'S POV

Blast is deep in prayer within a small side chapel.

CRUCIFIXES, PICTURES AND STATUES

The chapel is thickly decorated with an amazing assortment of crucifixes, pictures and statues depicting Suffering Christs, Tortured Saints, and other holy people in agony.

Blast stands and slowly, ritualistically begins to undress.

He is totally naked.

WHIP

Blast takes out a small whip.

Blast flagellates himself.

The whip has barbed ends. They cut a series of tiny crosses which rip and tear his flesh.

Blast's back runs with blood.

FULL SHOT

of whip gouging out pieces of flesh.

FULL SHOT

of Blast's face. He is in ecstasy!

BACK TO SCENE

Blood drops and splatters all over the floor.

As Blast flails himself, he intones slowly, soulfully and constantly,

BLAST

Purgare! Purgare! Purgare!

INT. -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer's knees goes weak and he slinks down the wall a bit.

ALTAR PICTURE

As he does, Cramer is further shocked as he sees -- not a tortured, mangled Christ over the altar but -- JOOS VAN CLEVE'S "NURSING VIRGIN."

The Virgin Mary's half smile and the frowsy child epitomize domestic happiness.

VENUS OF WILLENDORF

Odd as this is, Cramer also sees, set to the side but still on the altar, the Venus of Willendorf.

Cramer rubs his eyes. He is stunned.

As Cramer sneaks out of the Chapel, the SLAP of the lash and the MOANED petition from Blast is heard.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SALT LAKE CITY AIRPORT -- DAY

AERIAL VIEW

The majesty of the WASATCH RANGE is seen.

INT. BLAST ON PLANE -- CONTINUOUS

Blast leans to look out the plane's window.

He nudges his companion, Father O'Brien, S.J., who is the grey-streaked-scar bearded guerrilla whose photo Cramer saw in Blast's office.

BLAST

(pointing)

Salt Lake.

FATHER O'BRIEN

I hear the Mormons walk on water!

Both men laugh.

EXT. AIRPORT WAITING AREA -- CONTINUOUS

Blast walks up to Cramer. Father O'Brien is behind him.

Both are dressed in formal priestly attire.

Cramer tries hard not to stare at O'Brien's grey-streaked scar in his beard.

After a handshake, Blast turns to introduce his companion.

BLAST

Professor Cramer meet Father O'Brien, S.J. He's my Jesuit conscience!

Blast chuckles. The others don't.

O'Brien and Cramer just stare at each other.

Blast misses this and talks as he starts walking.

BLAST (CONT'D)

He's researching pre-Columbian religions and I've convinced him that a stop over here would be good for ... for his soul.

Again, Blast chuckles at his little joke.

Cramer and O'Brien uncomfortably shake hands as they turn to follow Blast.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BYU CAMPUS -- LATER

As Cramer, Blast and O'Brien walk through the campus to their lodging, numerous window signs and bulletin boards reveal

Millennial excitement.

SIGNS AND BULLETIN BOARDS

"They're Coming!"

"Prepare, Purify, Pray"

"Millennial City, USA -- Be There!"

EXT. STUDENT PRAYER GROUP -- CONTINUOUS

They pass a series of small groups engrossed in prayer.

BLAST

(impressed; sarcastic)

Are Mormons always this fervent?

EXT. -- CONTINUOUS

An exuberant crowd of young faces merge upon and surround Cramer.

1ST YOUTH

Oh, Professor Cramer, come with us. Come to the mountains and wait with us!

2ND YOUTH

We're burning everything ... purifying ourselves from all material possessions!

CRAMER

Who? Why are you doing this? This is not what I said!

The crowd is not chastened, rather it is emboldened.

3RD YOUTH

Peter Smith has had a revelation. He talks daily with the angels! You must talk with him!

CRAMER

Peter? Where is he? What type of nonsense is this? I've told you about the discipline. You cannot go outside the guidance of your elders.

The crowd is quickly deflated, but is as quickly aroused to arrogance.

2ND YOUTH

Elders? Peter says the new revelation is for young men, strong men ... not old men. We are the angels!

The others take up the chant,

CHANT

"Angels! Angels!"

The young crowd rushes away.

EXT. -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer starts to walk away when he abruptly turns back to Blast and O'Brien whom he has almost forgotten.

Blast takes control.

BLAST

Looks like I came just in time!

(to O'Brien)

We might have to dust off the "Malleus" before long!

A wicked grin curls O'Brien's lips.

Cramer is not amused.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BYU CAMPUS -- AFTERNOON

In the student plaza Cramer is on a small stage at a microphone.

Around him the crowd of student is broken into groups assembled under signs.

SIGNS

"Christ has Redeemed Us, Satan is Banished, There is No Sin"

"Fast, Deny, Purge and Pray"

"Polygamy is The Father's Command"

"God's Revelation, Not Man's Law"

PETER SMITH stands next to the sign, "God's Revelation, Not Man's Law." He is 20, red-haired and fiery of soul.

BIBLE AND BOOK OF MORMON

He holds the Bible and the Book of Mormon which he raises high as he speaks.

STUDENT #1

This is the End Time. Man's laws, all earthly laws are naught. Only God's Revelation counts. For us

(indicating all students)

this is a time when everything is allowed.

Cheers rise from the crowd.

CHEER #1

Jesus has saved us!

CHEER #2

Angels! Angels! Hear their voices!

CHEER #3

We are Adam. We are Eve.

Cramer is upset and angrily impassioned.

CRAMER

Stop! Stop! Cease this insanity!

But Peter Smith voice BOOMS with authority and charisma. He reads from the Book of Mormon.

PETER SMITH

"Behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden."

He closes the book, lifts his eyes to heaven, tightly shuts them as if receiving a revelation.

He heaves a monumental sigh. Then preaches,

PETER SMITH (CONT'D)

To be saved we must fall. Fall deeply into sin to be saved by our Almighty Father! So sin, sin and sin deeply O ye Adams and Eves of the End Time!

As Smith says, "To be saved we must fall," Cramer, shakes his head and frantically waves his arm.

Cramer tries to get the attention of the crowd. He quotes parts of 2 Peter 3:11-14.

CRAMER

No! No! ... Listen not to this Peter Smith but to the Apostle Peter who told us exactly what to do.

"Since everything around us is going to melt away, we should be living holy and godly lives ... While you are waiting for the new heaven and the new earth try hard to live without sinning and to be at peace with everyone."

But Cramer's passionate plea only temporarily quiets the crowd.

BOTTLES

Peter Smith holds up a bottle of wine and shouts,

PETER SMITH

May the sin of Adam and Eve make us worthy of the final redemption!

Peter swigs from the bottle.

Then he passes it to a student at his right who drinks and passes it on.

Other bottles appear and the energy of the crowd explodes into youthful exuberance.

Students begin to pass around bottles of many liquors.

SFX Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire" BLARES over the loudspeakers.

A frenzy grips the students as they begin to wildly dance.

Soon, men and women are disrobing.

Cramer is shocked. He falls down on his knees in prayer.

Men and women start rolling on the ground in sexual embrace.

INT. BYU CLASSROOM WINDOW -- CONTINUOUS

Blast observes the chaos below.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAMER'S HOME -- EVENING

Cramer is sitting at his desk with the Bible and the Book of Mormon spread before him.

Around the room is his luggage.

Beside him are a stack of books with yellow tabs sticking out from his research.

Yellow pads circle the books. The appearance is of a frenzied night of research.

All at once Cramer stands, stares at all the books on his desk, and with a violent sweep knocks everything off his desk.

INT. VISION OF AREN -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer falls on his knees in prayer.

FULL SHOT

Cramer blurts out,

CRAMER

Aren! My love. Where, where?

Then Aren's face transforms into a BRIGHT LIGHT which moves out of the room.

EXT. FOLLOWING THE LIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer runs through the streets, chasing after the Light.

He does not respond to passing greetings.

GREETING #1

God be praised, Professor Cramer!

GREETING #2

What's happening, where are you going?

EXT. STEALING A BIKE -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer stops for a moment to catch his breath.

He sees a motorcycle.

As he steals it, he says,

CRAMER

God forgive me!

Cramer gives chase out of town.

EXT. IN THE MOUNTAINS -- CONTINUOUS

Cramer flies past a SIGN: "UINTA NATIONAL FOREST."

He blasts around hair-pin turns as he climbs up into the Wasatch Mountains.

A SIGN points: "MOUNT TIMPANAGOS"

SWEAR#1

Crazy fool!

SWEAR #2

Fucking idiot!

It's a wild, mad-man, furious chase.

EXT. THE MILLENNIAL REVELATION -- CONTINUOUS

SFX Cramer arrives in a SCREECH of brakes.

He jumps off and frantically searches around for Aren.

THE THREE NEPHITES REVEALED

In a blink, the Three Nephites appear.

They are wrapped within a bright aura.

They are hooded and Cramer cannot see their faces.

They point towards a line of trees.

Aren walks out into the opening and towards Cramer.

She is dressed all in white and within a bright aura.

Cramer is over-come and paralyzed by the wonder of it all.

Aren stands right next to Cramer.

NEPHITE #1

Do not touch her?

Cramer is perplexed.

NEPHITE #2

You are not ready.

Cramer falls to his knees.

He opens his arms towards heaven.

CRAMER

Father, help me!

As he prays, the Three Nephites drop their hoods.

Cramer sees, for the first time, that they are women.

AREN'S POV

Cramer is shocked and frightened.

He scrambles and scurries away on his knees.

He yells,

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Satan, be gone!

BACK TO SCENE

The Three Nephites turn, walk away and disappear.

AREN AND CRAMER

Aren, her aura gone, walks over and stands beside the cowering Cramer.

He does not see her.

AREN

My sweet Henry!

Cramer abruptly turns towards her.

Upon seeing her he falls backwards and sprawls on the ground.

He is terrified. He yells,

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Satan, be gone!

Aren starts to titter and then bursts into laughter.

Cramer crawls farther away.

AREN (humorously)

Are you the Great Inquisitor. That terror of the witches. Is this what I see?

(mocking; German accent)

Heinrich Kraemer, "The Hammer of Satan."

Cramer rubs his eyes.

CRAMER

It is you!

Aren extends her hand.

Cramer takes her hand and rises.

INT. A MESSAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Aren and Cramer walk over to a large rock and sit upon it.

The Moon is high and bright.

AREN

Was your heart opened?

CRAMER

They weren't witches?

Aren smiles.

AREN

The Three Nephites.

CRAMER

No. Can't be!

Aren stands and turns her face upward towards the Moon.

Cramer rises and stands behind her.

AREN

Yes. The Three Nephites. The three apostles who chose to stay behind. To whom Jesus gave immortal life.

Aren turns and is face-to-face with Cramer.

AREN (CONT'D)

Women. Yes. Before the gospels were written. In the original twelve, there were these three women.

Cramer scratches his head. He becomes professorial.

CRAMER

But there's no scriptural evidence.

AREN

It's the revelation of these Last Days, of the End Time.

Aren turns back and gazes upon the Moon.

MOON RAY

Slowly, a moon ray surrounds her.

Cramer is spooked. He screams.

CRAMER

No!

At his word, the moon ray disappears.

Aren turns back and faces Cramer.

AREN

Until you understand and can shout "YES!" I cannot be yours.

Cramer steps towards Aren.

He reaches out to embrace her. But as he does, her aura appears and she disappears into the Bright Light which rises and flies towards the Moon.

Cramer pulls at his hair and screams,

CRAMER

Nooooooooooo!

INT. BLAST'S WASATCH BUNKER

Blast sits at a console, fine-tuning a video transmission.

There are FOUR ASSISTANTS with him. They are not masked, and they wear clerical garb.

They are inside a rough concrete walled room. It is a bunker without windows.

The room is replete with sophisticated high tech consoles.

BLAST

(into microphone)

O-B, can you hear me?

Blast swears to no one in particular,

BLAST (CONT'D)

Fucking satellites!

Blast turns to one assistant who is smiling at Blast's foul language.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Look, just make sure the fu...

sweet Jesus, that the transmission is secured.

As Blast finishes, O'Brien's face pops up on the video screen.

He is at a like two-way video console. He looks at Blast as he talks.

O'BRIEN

"Mary's Tears" is set.

BLAST

What? Say again.

O'BRIEN

"Mary's Tears" is set. You got me secured, right?

BLAST

Yeah. We learned something from these Mormon devils.

(indicates the room)

Three-hundred feet inside the Wasatch, hot water, all the comforts of home.

(laughs)

We're piggy-backing on all their stuff. The needle's deep and they don't even know we're after the blood!

Blast flicks on two other screens.

MAP OF THE WORLD WITH TEAR-DROPS

One scrolls through a MAP of the world. In each country there are markers in the form of a tear-drop.

MADONNA IMAGES

On the other are scrolling images of paintings and statues of the Madonna with their locations TITLED below.

Blast slows down the scroll of images.

Blast's face reflects anger and pain, as he sees:

OUR LADY UNDERGROUND, CHARTRES

OUR LADY OF LUJAN, ARGENTINA

OUR LADY OF CZESTOCHOWA, POLAND

OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE, MEXICO

VIRGIN MARY OF MONTSERRAT, SPAIN

VELASQUEZ

Blast stops the scroll at DIEGO VELASQUEZ, "CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN," THE PRADO.

Blast slams his fists down.

His eyes bulge and his face reddens as he swears at the picture,

BLAST (CONT'D)

Coronation! Damnation! Foul breath of that seducing whore. Who is she to claim coronation!

All in the room are SILENT. They nod in agreement.

INT. AREN'S ESCAPE -- CONTINUOUS

The main video screen shows that O'Brien is listening. He frowns.

O'Brien speaks loudly to get Blast's attention.

O'BRIEN

Sprenger!

It takes some moments for Blast's rage to settle.

BLAST

What?

O'BRIEN

(perplexed)

She's gone.

Blast stares at the screen.

BLAST

(unbelieving)

You smoking dope again, you Irish fiend?

There is SILENCE.

O'Brien hits a switch.

VIDEO OF AREN'S DISAPPEARANCE

A video runs with a DATE and TIME SIGNATURE at bottom.

It shows Aren in her spot on MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 1999 at 3:33 a.m. and

at 3:34 a.m. surrounded by a aura of bright light,

and at 3:35 a.m. Aren is gone.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Again.

The video is run a second time.

As the video ends and the screen is blank, SILENCE fills the air.

In a moment, Blast folds his hands in prayer.

He touches his lips with his index fingers.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Sweet Jesus, she is a witch!

OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE, MEXICO

VIRGIN MARY OF MONTSERRAT, SPAIN

OUR LADY OF CZESTOCHOWA, POLAND

CNN TV REPORTER (V.O.)

Some call it a conspiracy. But by whom? Every major religious leader has denounced the destruction. Every major political leader has disavowed any knowledge of the purpose of such mad and mindless actions.

Under the aegis of the United Nations, by satellite CNN has gathered an international panel of world leaders to discuss what might be happening. They have been tele-conferencing all week. Initial reports are that old animosities are ruling the day. Let's get an update.

INT. PANEL OF WORLD LEADERS -- CONTINUOUS

TV footage recedes into b.g. as panel is seen. TV Reporter and Blast are together.

The two other panel members are seen via video screens.

CNN TV REPORTER

With me here in our Atlanta studio is Roman Catholic Cardinal Blast, who, fortunately for us, is spending this semester teaching at BYU. That's an amazing story in itself, isn't it?!

Blast diplomatically smiles and nods approvingly.

CNN TV REPORTER (CONT'D)

From Jerusalem, we have Rabbi Israel Meyer. Welcome Rabbi.

RABBI MEYER is solemn. He nods and says,

RABBI MEYER

Good Morning. Shalom.

CNN TV REPORTER

And the Honorable Shev Prachter, Secretary-General of the United Nations. Mr. Prachter requested some time for a brief statement.

SHEV PRACHTER is an elderly Pakistani. He is anxious and distressed.

SHEV PRACHTER

The United Nations on behalf of all its members nations call the great Western religious leaders to account and plead with them to get their house in order. This madness is clearly of the Western mind. This "millennium" is a religious vision not shared by secularists and non-Western religions. The Year 2000 is not on the calendar of the Buddhist, the Hindu, the Jain, not for the Zen Masters, and not for aboriginal peoples. With the greatest respect for our spiritual brothers in the West, we look to you for leadership and a solution in this matter.

Rabbi Meyer is indignant.

RABBI MEYER

How blind can everyone be? This can only be a Christian conspiracy. Why would a Jew bother himself with images of Mary?

PICTURES OF ARTWORK

As the Rabbi speaks, PICTURES of the desecrated art appear.

BOTTICELLI'S "PRIMAVERA"

EL GRECO'S "ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN"

DURER'S "EPITOME'"

MICHELANGELO'S "PIETA"

OUR LADY OF FATIMA

RABBI MEYER

What do I care about Botticelli's "Primavera"? Or El Greco's "Assumption of the Virgin"? What does Durer's "Epitome" or Michelangelo's Pieta or the Lady of Fatima mean for a Jew?

BLAST

(defensively to Meyer)

But you were happy about the destruction of the goddess sites, weren't you?!

Rabbi Meyer waves Blast off.

RABBI MEYER

Goddesses! They don't bother us anymore!

Blast snickers at Meyer's remark.

BLAST

They don't? Naked women in Playboy. Sexual intercourse on cable TV and on video. Daily advertisements of women in scanty undergarments.

Blast is heated, incensed and sweating.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Goddesses are all about! The same idols Moses and Abraham smashed.

(challenging)

Aren't you a true son of Moses and Abraham?

The Reporter tries to regain control.

CNN TV REPORTER

Father. Rabbi. Let's not attack one another.

Rabbi Meyer pounds his fists together.

RABBI MEYER

Attack? Cardinal Blast is the head of the former Holy Office ... of the Inquisition. He is the Grand Inquisitor! He is ready to burn witches, to destroy what he calls pagan sites,

(with great bitterness)

and to burn Jews, again.

There is a moment of stone-cold silence.

BLAST

(calmly)

This is old history, ancient wounds -- what has it to do what is happening now?

(sentimentally)

Mary, the Mother of God, of the Savior of the World, why, what an affront to Christianity! How can anyone say this is being done by Christians? It is a desecration of what we hold to be holy, sacred, and true.

CNN TV REPORTER

Mr. Prachter.

SHEV PRACHTER

The UN has appointed an international security team to coordinate the investigation of these events. We will do all we can.

The Reporter looks at Blast and then nods towards the screen showing Rabbi Meyer.

The TV screen recedes into the b.g. as Cramer and Cardinal Bonifaci are seen sitting at a conference table. They sip coffee and eat muffins. Bonifaci strokes his whitebeard.

BONIFACI

My brother Cardinal is less than forthcoming.

Cramer is intrigued by this remark.

CRAMER

Meaning?

Cardinal Bonifaci rises and walks over to a window.

He gazes upon the dome of St. Peter's cathedral.

BONIFACI

The attacks have come on feast-days of the Blessed Mother.

The Cardinal turns towards Cramer.

BONIFACI (CONT'D)

Our Mass celebrations follow a calendar of feast-days. The first attack was August 15th, the feast of the Assumption of Mary. The other day it was October 11th, the celebration of Mary's Divine Motherhood.

The Cardinal walks over and pours himself some coffee.

BONIFACI

If this pattern holds true, December 8th, the Immaculate Conception -- that is the last feast day this year, before the Millennium celebration.

Cramer is fascinated.

CRAMER

So, you believe it's one of your own?

The Cardinal sighs, looks heavenward, then sips his coffee.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

Then, why am I here?

BONIFACI

Indeed, why?

Cramer is flabbergasted.

CRAMER

You don't know?

The Cardinal is honest but diplomatic.

BONIFACI

My dear Cramer, this is all Cardinal Blast's doing. An intriguing mind, my brother's. I would believe that he hoped for your conversion here, once within these sacred walls, once engaged with the best minds of the Catholic church. Would that surprise you?

CRAMER

Nothing about my "brother" Blast would surprise me. But let me ask, what is it about Mormonism you suppose interests him?

The Cardinal chuckles and turns from Cramer as he says over his shoulder.

BONIFACI

Witches. Satan's children and witches. What else would you expect would interest the seed of the great Sprenger? What else, our modern day Grand Inquisitor?

Cramer's face reveals that he has discovered a new insight.

CRAMER

What else, yes! Witches. He even found demons molesting my fiancé's hair.

Cardinal Bonifaci is struck by this account. His eyebrows register that it is of some interest to him.

Cramer does not notice the Cardinal's response.

CRAMER

O'Brien turns to throw his beer can into a trash-can when he sees Aren.

She stands near the harness and sky-hook. She is dressed all in white.

O'Brien is blown-away by seeing her. He is frightened and fascinated.

He blesses himself as he says,

O'BRIEN

Jesus, forgive me for my sins!

O'Brien falls onto his knees.

AREN

Come here.

O'Brien looks up. His eyes are filled with terror. He makes the sign of the cross in the air.

O'BRIEN

Satan, be gone!

Aren commands,

Come here!

O'Brien cannot resist her. He rises and with a trembling gait moves towards her.

He stands before her.

Aren kneels down beside him.

She places her left palm upon his forehead.

BLAST (V.O.)

You shall not permit a sorceress to live!

O'Brien whirls about looking for Blast.

O'BRIEN

But master there are no sorceresses today.

BLAST (V.O.)

Fool! Idiot! Are you so blind and stupid as not to see? See her image, everywhere. More than that of Jesus, himself. Turn on the TV and she is there. Turn on the radio and hear her siren song. Pick up a newspaper and she shimmers with naked lust!

Does not the goddess rule?!

Who, who among you will follow me and do The Father's will?

"I shall have no gods before me?"

O'BRIEN

Aren walks around the room. She is distressed. She is searching for something.

She comes to a desk and rifles through its draws.

BREVIARY

She comes upon a Roman Catholic priest's breviary.

She notes that it has several holy card place-markers.

They are funereal holy cards. On one side is a grotesquely tortured and suffering crucified Christ.

On the back-side, Aren sees the TITLE:

DIES IRAE

Then she reads the text, out loud.

HOLY CARD

Days of wrath and doom impending

David's word with Sibyl's blending

O what fear man's bosom rendereth

She gasps in disgust,

AREN

Oh, how terrible!

She throws the card away. Yet she keeps her finger as a page marker.

Then, she flips to the second section. She sees,

BREVIARY

October 11th, Feast of the Divine Motherhood of Mary.

She flips back to the first section. She reads,

AREN

August 15th, Feast of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven.

She flips to the next two page-marked cards. She reads,

Are you willing to die for another?

Aren gives a hesitant,

AREN

Yes.

INT. SARAH, ABRAHAM AND ISAAC -- CONTINUOUS

Aren and Sarah materialize atop a mountain.

There is a pyre set.

Coming up the mountain is ABRAHAM and ISAAC.

Abraham sets-about tying his son onto the pyre.

He pauses to pray.

He turns and raises his sword and is about to slay his son, when Sarah speaks. She paraphrases Genesis 22:11-12.

SARAH

Abraham! Abraham!

ABRAHAM

Here am I.

SARAH

Do not lay your hand on your son or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.

Then, Abraham and Isaac disappear.

Aren looks at Sarah and falls to her knees.

AREN

It is you, Mother?

SARAH

Yes, I am your mother and your sister and

(with joy)

your daughter!

Aren's face is quizzical.

Sarah laughs and then reaches for Aren's hand.

Aren rises.

SARAH (CONT'D)

I am within you, part of your soul. This is your power. The power to create, give birth, to laugh and cry in the midst of joy.

Aren is still perplexed.

SARAH (CONT'D)

The old witch, she is right. The male lives within you.

SARAH INTO ABRAHAM -- SPF

Sarah steps backwards and is transformed into Abraham as she says,

SARAH (CONT'D)

I am Abraham.

She touches Aren's face.

SARAH (CONT'D)

And you are Isaac.

She steps towards and places a hand upon Aren's head. Her words reference Genesis 1:27 ff.

SARAH (CONT'D)

In the image of God, so were male and female created. This is spiritual power. The power created when male and female couple and so, together, create new images of God.

She draws Aren closer and kisses her.

SARAH (CONT'D)

This is what Abraham had to learn. That his son, our son, is God's power manifest. That Death is transitory, a state of transformation. That we live forever as The Holy Family.

Aren brightens.

AREN

So, the old witch does have Satan's power. But only the power to kill, not to transform.

Sarah fixes on Aren's eyes and challenges.

SARAH

Or be transformed.

Sarah begins to fade away. Aren becomes anxious, fearful.

AREN

But how do I become transformed?

Sarah has disappeared.

SARAH (O.S.)

Become Isaac.

Aren is bewildered.

EXT. ALL SOULS MASS AT THE VATICAN -- EVENING

A long procession of priests, altar boys, and nuns, followed by a seemingly endless line of the faithful, moves from the BASILICA OF ST. PETER'S outside plaza, up a long flight of stairs and into the vestibule.

Everyone is dressed in black -- priests and laity.

All carry some form of candle or torch.

INT. ALL SOUL'S MASS AT THE VATICAN -- CONTINUOUS

Inside St. Peter's cathedral a traditional Catholic mass is being conducted.

In side-pews flanking the main altar are MONKS chanting.

Cramer stands, surrounded by priests, in one of the first pews. He wears black robes.

His eyes show that he is watching and recording every event. And that he is uncomfortable.

SFX in b.g. Mass is being INTONED in Latin.

Cramer glances at himself dressed in black. He fingers his robe and issues a distressed SIGH.

INCENSE, A SEA OF CANDLES, MONK'S CHANTING

This is the Roman liturgy at its most dramatic.

Altar boys are swinging incense crucibles.

Hundreds of candles strike out like stars in the night.

The chanting is hypnotic.

SFX a BRASS BELL is struck. All drops into SILENCE.

The celebrant of the Mass, Cardinal Bonifaci, enters, genuflects, and turns towards the congregation.

PRIEST

Oremus!

INT. THE CONSECRATION -- LATER

The Catholic ritual of consecration occurs.

Cardinal Bonifaci washes his fingers.

He blesses and raises the Host.

He blesses and raises the Chalice.

He intones, in Latin, the first words of a short prayer which the congregation picks-up en masse. His words appears SUB-TITLED as:

PRIEST

Christ has died.

Christ has risen.

Christ will come again.

Cramer seats himself as the others in his pew stand and start moving towards the altar to receive Holy Communion.

He is praying, to himself, the last phrase,

CRAMER

Christ will come again.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CRAMER'S CLASSROOM -- MORNING

In the b.g. on the blackboard are scribbled notes. Circled many times and standing out are:

ALL SOULS

with "ALL" underlined three times, and

DESCENT INTO HELL.

Cramer halts and turns to his students.

CRAMER

It's insanity! No matter how many times I try to understand this transubstantiation stuff, well, it all seems like such non-sense.

One student raises his hand. Cramer waves him off.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

It's like black magic.

He attempts a comic parody by holding up an imaginary Host and Chalice.

CRAMER

This bread is flesh?! This wine is blood?! Am I a cannibal?!

No one laughs. The room is leaden with dead SILENCE.

Cramer flushes with embarrassment. He steps back and sits down in his chair.

STUDENT #A

Is it any crazier to believe, as you Mormons do, that God is not a spirit but has a body like mine?

Cramer is silent; pensive.

STUDENT #B

Do Mormons believe that God has

(embarrassed)

has, has "private parts"?

The class erupts into laughter and short ejaculations.

STUDENT #C

God have mercy!

Cramer leans forward. His eyes are poisonously serious. It is like he is talking to the Devil, himself.

CRAMER

Isn't that what you Catholics fear? That God has a true son. Not a symbolic son. Not a make-believe son. But one of His own flesh.

Cramer stands. He is testifying.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

All souls. You believe in ghosts and spirits. That is why you fear witches. Yes, my ancient uncle, he knew how to make you hate being a man.

Cramer picks-up a book from his desk. It's title is clearly seen.

MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

Cramer holds the book above his head as he says,

CRAMER (CONT'D)

He told you that witches are after your cocks. Let me tell you that that is the message of Satan. The denial of God's sexuality.

Cramer starts pacing in front of the class.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

That is why you dress in black and live as if you are dead. Dead to the world. Dead to the flesh. Dead to your cocks.

But know, true spirituality is not grounded in a life of celibacy. No. No. If we Mormons have received any new revelation it is this, that we humans are gods.

The students erupt into shouting and condemnation.

STUDENT #D

Blasphemy! Paganism!

STUDENT #E

Go back and drown in that great Salt Lake!

Cramer pauses. The room settles. He continues.

CRAMER

And the way you die for another is through laying down your body as a lover.

The classroom bell RINGS.

The students file out in silence. They do not look at Cramer.

AREN (CONT'D)

I do not know Satan's plan. But I pray that you save my sisters, your daughters, those who, while not your prophetesses, none-the-less do not deserve to die. Protect them from the evil ones who damn all women as witches.

Aren reads from the list.

AREN (CONT'D)

Protect, Dear Parents, BETTY FRIEDAN

ANGELA DAVIS, GERMAINE GREER, MARY DALY, MARGARET THATCHER, CORETTA KING and all who have been singled out for sacrifice, for slaughter.

She falls to her knees.

And as she says, "fear," hands reach out and muffle her mouth.

Aren looks up into the demonic eyes of Three Ski-Masked Kidnappers.

INT. BLAST'S BUNKER

Blast is on the telephone to Father John. Blast is angry and upset.

BLAST

For God's sake, John. What the hell happened?

Blast listens intensely.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Impossible.

Blast listens some more.

Then, he pounds the desk with the phone. He talks into the phone, again.

BLAST (CONT'D)

We couldn't have missed all the goddam whores and bitches!

You got her, right?

Blast is pleased by the positive response.

BLAST (CONT'D)

It must be witchcraft! It must be her! But how?

He falls to his knees.

He throws himself prone onto the ground.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KIDNAPPER'S BUNKER

Aren is seated inside a spotlighted area. However, she is not tied, nor is anything written on her forehead.

She appears comfortable. She waits for her kidnappers to speak. They do so, again, from the shadows.

Blast uses his ARTIFICIAL VOICE BOX.

BLAST

(interrogating)

Do you renounce Satan?!

AREN

You are Satan!

Father John curses,

FATHER JOHN

Burn in hell, you witch.

AREN

You are in hell.

Father John, masked, steps into the light and slaps her.

Aren falls off her chair.

Blast's hand reaches from the shadows and pulls Father John back.

Aren rights herself and sits down.

BLAST

You deny that you are in league with Satan?

AREN

What could I say or do that would make you believe me?

Blast enters Aren's light, unmasked, and without his artificial voice box.

Aren is taken aback a bit, but then not.

AREN (CONT'D)

Who else?

BLAST

(haughtily)

Was my name revealed to you?

AREN

What do you want with me?

Blast paces.

Blast CLAPS his hands and the room becomes fully lighted.

Father John takes off his mask, as do the three assistants who sit at the consoles.

The high tech character of the room is impressive.

Aren surveys the room. Her curiosity is evident.

BLAST

Utah.

Aren is still perplexed.

BLAST (CONT'D)

Foolish woman. Why would I ever come to Utah? But to hide in Satan's own den and steal his resources so as to slay him!

Blast laughs mightily and with pride. Father John and the others laugh, also.

Blast stands in front of Aren. He starts to lecture her. He references the whole of Utah and Mormonism as he says,

BLAST (CONT'D)

Here in this new promised land of Utah. Here with your new revelation and the greatest of heresies. Here, I, humble Inquisitor for the Lord, have staked my camp!

AREN'S HAIR

Blast strokes Aren's hair. He picks up a strand and twirls it.

BLAST (CONT'D)

To burn the Mother of Witches! ... You!

Blast is triumphant and euphoric.

Blast draws Aren's attention to the many monitors on the wall.

At his signal, all the screens come on.

Blast points to them.

BLAST

We've tapped into your Mormon treasure-house.

On the videos, NAMES roll by,

FACES,

Cramer wants to ask a question but hesitates.

NEPHITE #2

You want to ask, "The end of what?"

CRAMER

Yes. Yes.

NEPHITE #1

Cramer is perplexed.

NEPHITE #3

In Rome you found yourself. In your uncle. You received his inheritance of loneliness. You met his Christ who never left the Cross. Who dies and continues to die but never truly rose, was never re-born.

Cramer's eyes light up. He receives the inspiration.

These are the same people seen in the news-clips of Aren's world tour. They are dressed in religious and ethnic dress.

RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND SACRED FLOWERS

Each places upon the altar a symbol of their religion which they had also given to Aren on her tour. Included are sacred flowers and fruits: lotus, lily, pomegranates, sheaf of grain, and so forth.

AREN AND CRAMER

Aren beckons to Cramer. He steps up from the front of the crowd. He stands next to her.

They begin to pray together a paraphrase of Revelations 11:17-18.

AREN & CRAMER

"We give thanks, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for now you have assumed your great power and begun to reign. The nations raged, but your wrath came. It is time to judge the dead. It is time for your servants -- prophets and people alike, all people both small and great to be rewarded. It is time to stop those who destroy the earth. It is time to heal."

APPEARANCE OF THE DEAD -- SPF

A great clamor arises.

Ethereal faces appear and then materialize.

Individuals shout names of recognition.

They rush to greet one another.

They are struck with awe. Deceased loved-ones approach them.

All are amazed and delirious with joy. It is a joyous bedlam of reunion.

FACE #1

Father! Father!

FACE #2

My son, oh my son!

FACE #3

Dear wife, sweetheart!

Aren and Cramer turn around and walk to the altar.

PEOPLE OF EARTH -- SPF

As Aren and Cramer conduct the liturgy, they are transformed into all the PEOPLE OF EARTH. That is, in their place appear the religious couples who placed the symbols and offerings on the altar.

The voices of the People of Earth reflect their own accents.

THE CEREMONY

A YOUNG BOY and a YOUNG GIRL come forward.

BOWL OF DIRT

The Young Boy places a bowl of dirt before Aren and Cramer.

Aren and Cramer dip their hands into the bowl. They lift a handful of dirt and let it seep through their fingers as they say,

AREN & CRAMER

Dust we are and dust we shall be. Blessed is the dust which is our body, we the Earth. No longer shall we be destroyers of the earth ...

As this is said, a great EARTHQUAKE shakes the ground. It roars and thunders, but no one is hurt.

PEOPLE OF EARTH

for we are the earth!

As they say this, the earthquake ceases.

BOWL OF WATER

The Young Girl places a bowl of water on the altar.

As Aren and Cramer dip their hands into the water, their transformation into the People of the Earth begins.

PEOPLE OF EARTH (CONT'D)

We thirst, and our joy is the water of life which we are for one another.

Thunder and lightening rumbles through the sky. A violent thunderstorm erupts with wild winds. It subsides as they say,

PEOPLE OF EARTH (CONT'D)

We nurture one another. Our bodies are chalices of life's healing water.

A SMALL TREE

The Young Boy places a small tree on the altar.

PEOPLE OF EARTH

The tree and all that root are our lungs. Our breaths are a single breathing.

A BOWL OF FIRE

The Young Girl places a bowl of fire on the altar.

PEOPLE OF EARTH (CONT'D)

Fire is our desire. The passion of our heart. Our yearning to become more.

THE THREE NEPHITES

The Three Nephites appear. Nephite #3 advances and places the Venus of Willendorf on the altar. Aren and Cramer both hold it up for all to see. Cramer drops his hand. Holding the Venus Aren turns towards Cramer and says,

AREN

The goddess returns!

Cramer opens his arms.

CRAMER

The goddess returns!

As Cramer speaks, he steps forward and embraces Aren.

CRAMER (CONT'D)

The Father loves The Mother.

AREN

The Mother loves The Father.

Arms locked, they turn towards the people.

AREN & CRAMER

The Mother and Father love all the children.

The crowd cheers and dances about. The voices of the angel rise in symphonic praise.

As the cheering and dancing subsides, Aren and Cramer say,

AREN & CRAMER (CONT'D)

Let us celebrate the passing of loneliness and the return of The Holy Family.

DAISY-CHAIN

The Young Boy and Girl bring a long-flowing daisy-chain. Aren and Cramer let it flow over their necks and wrap around others of the People of the Earth.

AREN & CRAMER

All of us are daises. Humble yet radiant with the love of earth and water, wind and sun-fire. All of us are flowers, blossoms on a common vine.

PEOPLE OF EARTH

The goddess is within you. Come forth all men and women and know from today forward that you are the image of our Father and Mother in heaven as you embrace one another! For we are all, now and forever, holy, we are The Holy Family!

Aren and Cramer embrace and kiss. All around embrace and kiss.

AERIAL VIEW

pulls away and shows the crowd and the valley surrounded and bathed by an aura of light. The "Star of Bethlehem" pulsates in ever increasing brightness.

EXT. THE HOLY FAMILY -- SPFX -- CONTINUOUS

The Light forms into the appearance of The Holy Family: father, mother, son and daughter. Again, the images in The Holy Family slowly change into in the faces of the People of Earth.

Celestial music swells to an ear-piercing intensity and then shatters into SILENCE.

The screen remains bathed in the Light's aura.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AREN AND CRAMER AT HOME -- SUNSET

Aren and Cramer sway on a porch swing. Aren holds her baby DAUGHTER. On the lawn in front of them their SON plays.

Cramer waves to his son to join them. The child, holding a stuffed LION, toddles up the steps.

The boy sits on his father's lap. Cramer places his arm around Aren. He quotes Isaiah 11:6.

CRAMER

"... and a little child shall lead them."

Aren pulls out a stuffed LAMB and places it next to her son's Lion.

AREN

For them a New Heaven and a New Earth ...

As they rock back and forth, the faint outline of the Sun is seen as the Moon comes into fuller glow. The beauty of the snow-whitened peaks of the majestic Wasatch Range is manifest.

THE HOLY FAMILY -- SPF

The image of The Holy Family overlays the closing scene.
