CHAPTER 9

ADVICE FOR THE MEN ONLY

One evening my father pulled me aside and said "Son, there are few axioms I have put together over the years of dealing with women and they have stood the test of time over and over again. If you adhere to these, then you will be years ahead of your peers and it will save you a ton of bullshit experiences with women, that could have been avoided. It will help steer your interactions with women in the right direction and keep you from losing your sanity".

  1. Who you marry will be the most important decision you ever make in life. Better make sure she's up for the job.

  2. Never get married or get tied down with a woman who you're settling for. You will be miserable. She will be miserable. And life is too damn short to spend it with a woman low in caliber, personality and desire to suck your rooster dry every day.

  3. Believe a woman the first time she SHOWS you who she is. Don't allow your emotions to blind you to her flaws and shortcomings.

  4. Women are not the enemy. They are merely following their inherent nature. Learn how to handle them and you will be rewarded with their positive attributes. Flail about blindly and be cursed with their negative attributes.

  5. Women are led by their emotions. Therefore, learn to use their emotions to your favor. Become the puppet master.

  6. Always lead a woman in the relationship. If you don't know how, then learn how.

  7. Women are just more sexual, if not more than men. They crave depravity. Do not be fooled.

  8. Be ready to walk away from the relationship at any time for any reason. If she acts up, be ready to walk. If you stay you will lose a small piece of self-respect, until eventually you won't even know who you are anymore.

  9. What is unsaid when communicating with a woman, is oftentimes more powerful than what is said.

  10. Buying gifts, groveling, begging and changing for a girl will never keep her around. You'll only intensify her disdain for you and speed up her hunt for an alpha rooster.

  11. Never fully trust a woman. It's not in their nature to be trustworthy. Self-preserve by only allowing for 60% of your trust given after a full and long courtship of at least 2 years.

  12. Never get married before 30 years and always marry a younger woman. No exceptions.

  13. The moment you make a woman "your life", is the moment she's preparing to walk out of yours.

  14. Watch what a girl DOES, not what she SAYS.

  15. If a girl dumps you, never take her back. She will never respect you the same and the relationship is doomed to fail.

  16. Always let her say "I love you" first. She'll love you more for your self-control.

  17. The more money you get, the more you will attract women who are attracted to resources. Learn to put on a 'Humble Front' at first in order to screen the gold diggers out.

  18. Never put aside your personal goals and dreams in order to please a woman. You won't please her and you will be miserable.

  19. Always Bleep her like it's your last time before you go to prison.

  20. Lastly, holding his both ears he said "Never hit a woman. No excuses! It is wrong from all angles".

CHAPTER 10

ADVICE FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT

  1. Make friends with successful people and occasionally buy them gift and surprise them with lunch because successful people always give and hardly get, so when you give them, they value the gift a lot.

  2. Get a mentor and follow his instructions and respect the relationship. Never beg your mentor for money or disrespect his or her privacy.

  3. Make new positive friends as often as possible and ensure you keep the communication line open. Create a network of friends and not just connections.

  4. Show kindness to everyone. Some small boys today will be big boys tomorrow. The biggest dog in the neighborhood was once a puppy. And keep the information/secret to yourself.

  5. Always plan ahead and be proactive. He that plans the future work less in the future.

  6. Listen to speeches and messages from great teachers. Both religious and educational.

  7. Attend seminars and training on any area you need to improve yourself. Train the trainer, personal development, public speaking, sales etc.

  8. Have the habit of keeping a pen and a writing pad handy because ideas come in the form of flashes. The smallest pen is bigger and better than the biggest brain.

  9. Make sure at every point in time you are reading a book. If you spend 20 minutes reading daily, for 52 weeks you would have consumed 1,000,000 words.

  10. Stay away from television as much as possible. You can watch educational channels. Men with big TV sit in front of them to watch men with big library.

  11. Put control over your mouth, never say evil of any man, what you are not certain of should not be said. Say good of all men.

  12. Always show appreciation for any good deed you received and always helps someone in need.

  13. Live a debt free life. What you can't pay cash for is not your size.

  14. Give out loans that you can part with as gift, so that you don't destroy your business and relationship.

  15. Create legitimate multiple source of income and save at least 10 percent of your income.

  16. Invest a portion of your income. And be patient to see it grow. If what you have in your hands is not good to be called a harvest then it's a seed, sow it.

  17. Keep a good financial record of all income and expenses, so you won't ask later "where did my money go"

  18. Be involved in community service. Control traffic, free lesson class for students etc.

  19. Keep getting better on your daily goals and dream, develop yourself on them and make sure you get to the top 10 % of your industry.

  20. Make sure you engage in exercise. It keeps your brain alert and your body fit to enjoy your success.

MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES
