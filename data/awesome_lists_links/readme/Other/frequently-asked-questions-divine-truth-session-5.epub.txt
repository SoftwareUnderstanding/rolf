### This ebook is a collection of answers given by Jesus (AJ Miller) on the topic of God's Truth (Divine Truth). The answers were given in an interview with Mary Magdalene (Mary Luck), who posed frequently asked questions from members of the media and public, on 29th September 2013 in Wilkesdale, Queensland, Australia. In this session Mary questions Jesus about providing more detail about some of the specific "qualities" or "attributes" of God's Truth, and how the examination of these qualities can be applied practically in our personal daily lives. Qualities thirteen and fourteen, that Jesus mentioned in the last question of the first session on the subject, are discussed in far more detail in this session. Jesus has much more to say about the subject, but is here providing an introduction to each "quality" or "attribute".

### Reminder From Jesus & Mary

### Jesus and Mary would like to remind you that any document produced by Divine Truth containing any information from Jesus, Mary or any other person includes only a portion of God's Truth that they have personally discovered.

### It does not and cannot contain the entire of God's Truth since God's Truth is infinite and humankind will forever continue to discover more of God's Truth as we progress in receiving more of God's Love.

### Please remember that due to these limitations information contained within this document may need to be revised in the future.

### Many other ebooks have been published by Divine Truth, including ebooks translated into a variety of different languages.

0. Introductory comments

Welcome to the fifth session of discussing Divine Truth qualities, or you could say the qualities of God's Truth. If we look at the last few sessions that we've done, we can see that basically we talk too much (laughs) and therefore couldn't cover everything we'd hope to cover.

So this particular session we're hoping to cover the last couple of qualities of Divine Truth, so that'll be four questions and then have one more question about living in truth and what it means to live in truth. With the other sessions this will sort of round out all of the sessions on the Divine Truth questions.

There are still over a hundred questions associated with the Divine Truth subject that we haven't covered, but we felt that we wanted to cover these qualities of Divine Truth first, because it helps overcome the questions of "how do I determine what is God's Truth and what isn't?" So that's our primary purpose today. So I hope you enjoy our session today and I think this time we will get through the four questions we have to answer. Thanks guys. (Laughs)

1. Quality thirteen: What do you mean when you say "Divine Truth is felt, it is emotional"?

Yes I feel this again is a very important quality of God's Truth in that it is not something that you can intellectually accept, it's something that also has to be emotionally accepted. A lot of people seem to believe that they can intellectually accept God's Truth and then try to put into practice God's Truth in their personal life and that's actually not possible.

It has to be an emotional experience and if you're trying then it means that you're not going through the emotional experience. The soul is automatic once we go through the emotional experience; it's automatic that we practice God's Truth once we've gone through the emotional experiences of clearing away the soul's error. If we have to try then it means it hasn't been an automatic process and therefore it can't be God's Truth, it's not yet accepted in the soul as God's Truth; it might be accepted intellectually, but it's not been accepted in the soul.

There's also this issue of having to try, with regards to God's Truth; the reason why we have to try is because we only have the truth intellectually and this is going to be a problem for the rest of our life if we are not careful. We can only progress to a certain degree by trying intellectually, because the actual soul change has not occurred. The only way a soul change can occur is something has to be felt - so error has to be felt and truth has to be felt. There is no other way that you can have a truth enter your soul without it being felt and there's no way for an error to leave your soul without it being felt.

So all of God's Truths must be felt before they can be truly acknowledged as a part of your own experience. Before that time you basically just have to try intellectually to understand it, but there are going to be some major problems with that because the intellect isn't designed to understand all of God's Truths. The human intellect usually exists within the spirit body of the person and the spirit body is only able to intellectually understand God's Truths to the point of the sixth dimension, so any truths that are above the sixth dimension cannot be understood without feeling them and for that reason, Divine Truth must be felt. It is an experience that we have to have, rather than just thoughts that we have.

This is where I feel the majority of the Earth's religions and religious practices have gone wrong. Most of the Earth's religions have focused on the intellectual acceptance of God's Truths or attempting to intellectually accept God's Truth, and it's quite obvious that they haven't emotionally accepted God's Truth, because if they had then they would not war with each other, they wouldn't promote violence, they wouldn't even argue with each other about their differing opinions. They would present what they believe perhaps, but if Divine Truth was felt, what eventually happens is everyone finishes up with the same belief.

It's like everybody will eventually finish up having the same belief about gravity, and gravity is one of God's Truths. So from a physical perspective we accept that everyone will eventually finish up having the same belief about things like gravity, aerodynamics and all the other scientific principles of the Universe, and it's time that we started to understand that we will eventually have the same beliefs about love, and we'll eventually have the same beliefs about God's Universal truths relating to the spirit body and to the soul of the individual and the emotional content of the individual.

So we'll eventually have the same belief systems. It doesn't mean that we'll have the same expression; we'll have the same belief systems. If we are differing in our opinions to others and differing in our opinion to God's Truth then of course it's impossible for us to have the same opinion as God on any matter and this is something that we need to do - we need to come to accept God's opinions on the matter.

**Mary:** And you're saying though that the only way we are going to do that or the world globally is going to do that is through a feeling process.

Exactly.

**Mary:** So it's not a matter of just hearing something and adhering to a doctrine? The truth has to be felt within the soul of the person, not in the spirit body, but the soul.

Yes and if you understand that love is an emotion - to actually feel the sensation of love you have to feel an emotion and if we understand that all of God's Truths are loving, then of course it means that all of God's Truths are also emotional, they have to be felt.

So while we might come to accept certain physical truths intellectually, in the reality we also come to accept them emotionally. So pretty much everyone on the planet by the age of two to three years have accepted the truth about gravity emotionally. They realized that every time they tried to bend the Laws of Gravity, some hurt occurred, some emotional experience occurred, and so they have come to accept in their soul the truth about gravity, from an emotional perspective, from an experiential perspective.

It's the same with all of God's Truths; to come to terms with all of God's Truths we are going to have to experience every single one of them emotionally. We can't expect to go through a process of intellectually hearing them and then knowing them.

What I see a lot of people doing with our seminars is, they think they know God's Truth and yet they've yet to have an emotional experience to release the errors that block them from knowing God's Truths. So it's impossible for them to actually know God's Truths in that state, as a result it's impossible for them to be loving and that's why many of them are still very unloving. It's impossible for them to express love and receive love under those conditions and it's also impossible for them to accept God's Truths under those conditions.

So it's very, very important that we understand that this emotional experience is essential to our progression, without it no progression can actually occur. The soul is built to progress only through an emotional experience.

**Mary:** And you said earlier that change would be automatic - once we have this feeling process, are you also saying it would be permanent?

Yes, so once we've actually released the emotional error - which will be an emotional experience every time - and once we accept God's Truth on the particular thing that we're experiencing - which will also be an emotional experience every time - then the truth will be in our soul, it will be a part of our very being. As a result of that it's impossible for us to act against it without experiencing a lot of pain and so we automatically then tend to operate in harmony with it, and as a result we do things all the time without having to try to do them. We are automatically doing them; we are automatically being loving; we automatically know what the truth is under those circumstances.

So it's really important that we understand that it's impossible for us to intellectually receive God's Truth without going through some kind of emotional experience for us to understand it.

I feel there is still a deep misunderstanding about that in almost everybody that listens to our presentations. They still believe they can go through some kind of intellectual experience of understanding the truth without it being an emotional experience and that's impossible. This is one of the qualities of God's Truth and what I love about it is - in a way it precludes the intellectual experience - so unless it's an emotional experience there is no way that we're going to discover God's Truths on a particular subject. This is a very beautiful way that God has made the Universe, that we're going to have to experience the Universe to understand the truth, rather than just think we know.

**Mary:** Yes, and try to understand it with our thoughts.

With our thoughts, yes. In fact there are many, many spirits in the spirit world below the sixth dimension, or the sixth dimension and below, who have no knowledge of the majority of God's Truths, particularly the major truths influencing the soul, and the reason why they have no knowledge, even though they have highly developed intellects, is because they have denied the emotional experience. They don't understand this particular quality of God's Truth and that Divine Truth has to be felt, rather than just intellectually heard.

**Mary:** Okay, what if a truth requires us to actually deny emotion, or to distance ourselves from emotion. Because we see that a lot, don't we?

Yes, so if somebody is presenting to us an idea or a concept as the "truth", or as "God's Truth": if we have to deny the emotional experience, a positive emotional experience in order to receive it, then it means that it can't be God's Truth, it just has to be a man-made idea.

So perhaps I can give some illustrations of that from a religious perspective initially. From a religious perspective many Christians would say that I died for their sins. Now if we look at this from an emotional perspective rather than just an intellectual one, how just is it for one person to die for the sins of many? Like you would never ask your own child, who was a good child, to die for the sins of the other child \- even if it was your own child - another child who made some kind of error. You would ask the child who made the error to pay for its own sin.

In fact in our current day and age, if a parent blamed one child who did not "sin", let's call it, or did not commit the wrong doing, for the child who did commit the wrong doing, we would view them as a very unloving parent and a very unfair parent. And interestingly enough, we would probably be quite upset with that parent about the injustice that the parent has perpetrated.

Ironically when it comes to the same reasoning about God we think that God's going to be unjust and that's not true at all. God is never going to be unjust. In fact the very thought of it rebels against the emotion of, "Where's the justice?" for the person who's having to pay for the sins, in this case myself. (Laughs) If I'm meant to have paid for the sins of everybody, if Jesus is meant to have paid for everyone's sins, then where's the justice for Jesus? There is none and therefore from an emotional perspective that particular teaching cannot be true, it cannot be God's Truth, it has to just be a man-made idea. In fact man-made ideas are full of injustice (laughs), and full of intellectual thinking without actually feeling through the process emotionally.

**Mary:** Do you also feel within that common widely held belief, that you died for people's sins, certainly there's a distancing from the natural kind of emotion that we would have about how unjust is that, but also is it not a way to distance myself from my own compensation for things that I have done emotionally by saying, "Actually I just need to believe in Jesus' blood and I don't actually have to deal with that"?

Yes I feel people have a justification for it, I don't know if that relates to our topic.

**Mary:** I was just talking about the distancing from emotion that that belief fosters.

Of course it distances us from emotion and basically it's also distancing the individual from responsibility, from personal responsibility. So it distances the person individually who believes in that belief from a lot of personal things that they need to go through; taking responsibility for their own life, feeling about it from an emotional perspective, feeling about it from Jesus' perspective; how would he feel about having to pay for their sins and feeling about it on a number of levels?

Now what I'm suggesting is if you feel about the particular doctrine that's being presented to you as God's Truth and it rebels against the feelings, in other words if you were placed in the situation personally, would you feel it was fair? And if you wouldn't feel it was fair personally, placed in the situation, then why is it fair for Jesus? It's not fair for Jesus obviously and as a result it rebels against the emotion.

Now of course people do have emotions that would cause them to want other people to pay for their errors, but they're not very just. In fact in this day and age we have a whole set of laws of the land which stop you from actually paying the price for somebody else's wrong doing. So if man-made laws do not allow it and then we assume that God's Laws do, then we have some pretty amazing thinking to adjust, because the reality is what we are doing is we're assuming that God is worse than the most loving person on Earth.

The reality is all of God's Laws are much higher and therefore more just and more loving than any person's laws on Earth and if on Earth we would rebel against the thought of you paying for my wrong doing, then we also should rebel against it from a religious or spiritual concept. And that is an indication of how - or an example of how - we need to look at this particular truth. This particular truth is telling us that unless we feel and we feel it's all right, we feel it's all in harmony, it's all balanced, and it's all ethical, unless we can feel that in whatever is presented to us: it is not God's Truth, it's quite simple.

**Mary:** Sure. Okay, just some things from the notes here, you contrast personal truth, or a soul's truth with Divine Truth in terms of emotion.

Well let's look at it from a soul's perspective. What is the soul's truth? In other words, what is my soul's truth? Well that's my beliefs, my desires, my passions, my emotions, my love principle - the expression of my love: that's my truth. From God's perspective God's Truth is: God's Emotions, God's Desires, God's Passions, God's Love and all of the things associated with God: that's God's Truth.

So really it's quite simple, we can look at those two things and see well okay for myself I am going to have to experience some kind of emotional experience before I can absorb truth. Before I can release whatever is the opposite of God's Truth error within me, I'm going to have to go through the emotional experience. It's going to involve my emotions, my passions, my desires, my longings and the love that's within me to do that, I'm going to have to engage that.

From a point of view of receiving God's Love we need to understand that God has Emotions, Desires, Passions, Longings and Love and we have the ability to receive these particular emotions, and I am going to have to go through a process of bringing my truth into harmony with God's Truth before that can occur. And the way I do that has to be emotional because God's Love is emotional: an Emotion from God.

**Mary:** And even you were saying that truth is centred emotionally in God and within us.

Without it being an emotional experience it doesn't actually exist in reality inside of our soul, that's the truth.

**Mary:** Which is quite an amazing statement really, isn't it? Actually saying that all of this busy-ness that goes on intellectually; unless there's an emotion attached to all that I'm experiencing, it doesn't even exist.

Exactly. It's not even real yet. It has barely any, if any, effect on my life. It has barely any effect on how I feel, because it hasn't entered my soul yet. It has barely any effect on how I feel and it has barely any effect in terms of what I can transmit to others. Unless I feel it, nobody else can feel it from me either. So I can think that I love them, but if my feelings are the opposite to that in some manner, then I don't love them. The feeling I'm having is a completely different feeling, whatever that feeling might be. When the feelings are true, then you could say another person should be able to then feel that feeling, as long as they are open to the reception of that feeling.

So just because I love you, it doesn't mean that you will be open to the reception of that love. There's got to be an opening in your soul, an emotional experience in your soul for you to receive that particular love. The same applies to God; just because God loves you, it doesn't mean that you're going to automatically receive God's Love, unless you feel something, you're not going to receive it - as simple as that. So you can think that you're praying for God's Love, you're not going to be receiving it until you're feeling something for God's Love to enter you. You'll actually feel the emotion as God's Love and you'll be overwhelmed with emotion, it'll be an emotional experience. You can't avoid it and if you're trying to avoid it, you cannot receive God's Love, as simple as that. If you're trying to avoid the emotional experience, you cannot receive it and that's something that we need to understand; that we cannot receive God's Truth or God's Love without there being an emotional experience.

**Mary:** Okay, so then how do we analyse truth, if from what you've just said, it doesn't really exist if we are just thinking about it?

In terms of how do we analyse it?

**Mary:** What is truth, how do we analyse what is truth?

Well if we look at this particular quality, basically what we're saying is the way to analyse truth is to work through the emotion, that's what we're saying. So we're saying that you're going to have to have some kind of emotional analysis of everything that you receive, not just an intellectual one.

If you think about the truths that are established from a physical perspective again, so if we go back to gravity as an example, the emotional analysis of gravity usually happens when the child starts walking so it's an automatic process basically. The child starts walking, it has an unbalance, then it starts making a few steps and it falls flat on its face. It has a big cry, starts to feel the effect of gravity on itself and then it knows that if it gets up higher or climbs up something and falls down, there's more hurt then, it hurts more. So therefore it understands that the higher you go the more it hurts, if you don't obey the law.

So you start taking care with the Law of Gravity automatically and you do it automatically because it's been an emotional experience. And it doesn't matter how much a parent says to the one year old, "You've just got to be careful now how you're walking," it doesn't matter how much the parent tries to explain that to the child; until the child goes through the personal, emotional experience, it will not have a respect for that Law of Gravity. It will not have a feeling for the Law of Gravity, it will not have a feeling for its own safety, it won't have a feeling and an experience. Every time when there was pain when it tried to break the law it won't have any of those things and that's why every child goes through the experience, even though the parent knows the Law of Gravity, herself or himself.

So if we look at that, the way to analyse the Universe from a larger perspective is to analyse it in the same manner. We look at everything from an emotional perspective as well as a logical, intellectual one and the two have meet each other, there has to be an agreement between the emotional and the logic. The emotion has to have a logical explanation in it and it always will with God's Truth - everything is like that with God.

So every Truth of God always has a resonance with the emotion as well as with the logic and by the way if you preclude the logic then obviously there's a problem as well. So if you're precluding logic in the analysis and you're only having the emotional experience, then that's also a problem. But that's not the main problem that most people on Earth have - most people on Earth prefer intellect and preclude the emotion.

**Mary:** Yes. Okay, what about if we have emotional errors still inside of us, can we see truth then?

No, again the emotional error that exists inside of us is basically like a wall - it's an emotional wall that prevents the absorption of emotional truth on the same subject. So as we've said in "How The Human Soul Functions", which is another set of frequently asked questions that we answered, if inside of our soul we have an error emotionally on a certain subject at a certain time, then at that particular time and on that particular subject none of God's Truth can enter us because all of God's Truth on the subject is going to be emotional as well. The two emotions are in complete opposition to each other \- the emotion of error opposes the emotion of truth.

So the only way we are going to be able to absorb the actual truth, no matter what we think in our intellect, the only way our soul is going to be able to absorb the truth, is by first going through the process of emotionally releasing the error. Once the emotional release of the error has occurred, now we have the ability to emotionally absorb the truth.

This is why it's so important to understand this particular principle about God's Truth, because if we think that we can with our mind absorb God's Truth, while at the same time retaining an error in the soul about the same subject, then we are just deluding ourselves. It is also impossible for us to under those circumstances to automatically change and automatically do what the truth dictates.

So what we need to understand instead is that God's Truth is such that it is emotionally felt and experienced. If I'm not emotionally feeling it and experiencing it, then it means that I have an error within myself that is also an emotion that needs to be experienced before that emotional experience of God's Truth can enter me.

So we need to understand this relationship between how our soul blocks the absorption of God's Truth and one of the primary ways it blocks it is by not allowing the emotion. That's one of the ways that the majority of people who have heard Divine Truth for many years, the reason why they do not progress as rapidly as they could is because they are usually constantly blocking the emotion, and when you are blocking the emotion it is impossible to receive new truth.

**Mary:** Okay just a final part from your notes here, you said, "Eternal growth towards universal truth is only possible when we have emotional intelligence." What do you mean by this emotional intelligence?

Well if I could define the term as I would express it, emotional intelligence is your emotions in complete harmony with logic. It's not just emotions expressed without any intelligence or logic.

So for example the emotion of anger to me is not an expression of emotional intelligence. It's an emotion of error that we need to have leave us. So we need to let it flow out of us and if we have emotional intelligence, we would understand that the anger needs to flow out of us and so therefore we would allow it's experience in a safe environment, but we would allow it in such a way where it wouldn't harm another.

So in other words we wouldn't all of a sudden get into a rage and decide to murder somebody; if we had emotional intelligence we could not do such a thing. The reason why is because there would be other emotions inside of us that say, "It is wrong to murder somebody, it's taking away their will, it's taking away their life, it's putting them in our control, which is not something that would be in harmony with love." For that reason we would automatically feel that it's impossible to go and murder somebody under any circumstance, even if they tried to murder ourselves or murder our loved ones, we would still feel it was impossible if that particular belief was in our soul.

So it's very important for us to see that if we had emotional intelligence what we would know is that we have to let go of error in order to receive truth and the process of letting go of error is an emotional experience. We would also know that the process of absorbing God's Truth is an emotional experience, and if we have emotional intelligence we would know that and we wouldn't fight the process.

Now what I see a lot of people doing is fighting the process tooth and nail and they spend a lot of their life avoiding the process with their intellect or fighting that process; that is an indication that there is little emotional intelligence present.

We need to develop some emotional intelligence if we are ever going to understand all of God's Universal Truths; the reason why is, as I've said, up until the sixth dimension it is possible to receive truths intellectually and try to do something different and actually make some changes over long periods of time. However the soul has yet to really fully change and the only way full change can occur is for the soul to go through the emotional experience of releasing its error so that it has the emotional capacity to understand God's Truth. That is a process that will need to be engaged by every single person who ever wants to become at-one with God.

If we don't engage that process we are not really displaying emotional intelligence. We might be thinking that we're intellectually intelligent, but the reality is that for a person to be happy completely there needs to be some emotional intelligence. In fact once they have that completely, there'll be complete emotional intelligence, just like their intellectual intelligence will be completed to a large degree as well. So they'll at that point have the ability to absorb new information because there is no blockage emotionally to the absorption because all the emotional error that prevents the absorption has been released.

**Mary:** But first we need to allow this emotional process.

Exactly, just like the child goes through the experiential process when it discovers the Law of Gravity; we need to allow ourselves to go through the experimenting and experiential process to find all of God's Truths, all of them.

So if you like we're engaging an emotional process of discovering truth, that's what we're doing, and we need to understand that that's what we're doing. It's not just an intellectual, "How does this work, how does that work?" It's an emotional feeling about how it all works and a knowing as a result. Because we've released the error, once the truth enters us we know how it all works and it's very, very easy for us then to put it into practice. In fact it's impossible for us to not put it into practice under those circumstances.

So everyone who's struggling to love has yet to engage that particular process, they are yet to understand that God's Truth is always going to be felt, it's always going to be an emotional experience. If you're struggling to practice it, it means that there are emotional blockages of error within that need to be released.

And why would it be that you're not experiencing this error? Well that's because you have a belief that the intellect should be dominant over the emotion and that's not the way God created the soul. God created the soul as we see it expressed in the child, and you can see the child goes through the experiential process. So it doesn't matter how much the parent lectures the child (laughs) about something, some kind of danger, sooner or later the child will only discover that danger through its own experience. And that is the beauty of the way God's made it.

If we understood that from the beginning, we would have less intellectual engagement of what's going on in terms of "what is truth, what isn't?" and we wouldn't have these large debates about what is truth and what isn't, we would have more emotional engagement. We would be looking at everything that's coming to us and we'd be going, "Okay, I hear that person presenting to me what that person believes is the truth. Let me analyse this truth from an emotional perspective. Does it make sense to my emotional intelligence? Not just to my intellect, not just to my logic," because there are a lot of seemingly logical things that are presented that as soon as you allow yourself to analyse them from the heart perspective, from an emotional perspective, you can instantly dismiss them, and that applies to the majority of spiritual teachings on this planet. You could instantly dismiss them if you analyse them just through this particular perspective.

2. Quality thirteen. What does a soul based understanding that, "Divine Truth is felt, it is emotional", look like in my personal life?

Well firstly we would not try to do anything, we would understand that the process we've got - with regard to love - is not automatic. In other words if I do not understand God's Laws automatically, then it means that there is an emotion that I have to experience that opposes my understanding; not an intellectual understanding that I've got wrong, but rather an emotion that I've got inside of myself that's out of harmony with love and truth.

If I understood that, the wrongness, if you could call it that, is emotional and not intellectual - it's not a lack of intellectual knowledge - then I would have a lot better understanding about this particular quality.

So in my day-to-day life I wouldn't try to do everything or anything, I wouldn't be using my intellect to make decisions, I wouldn't be changing just my actions; I would instead want to feel every feeling that I actually have on that particular subject and when I notice the feeling was out of harmony with love or truth, I would wish to release it from myself, and I wouldn't resist that process if I understood this quality. I would love that process; I would actually engage that process willingly.

So as you know there are not many people on the planet who yet love that process and so therefore they've yet to have a soul understanding of this particular Divine Truth.

**Mary:** Alright, some things from your notes. I think you just covered this one, "I do not try to live in Divine Truth, rather I feel Divine Truth as emotions within my soul. I understand that if I'm trying, it is because I am yet to actually make the soul change needed."

And that's a very important understanding to get at the soul level. To understand that if you are having to try and if you are having to change your actions, but you still have a longing in your soul to keep doing the previous thing you were doing, that you know was unloving, then it means that there's yet to be a soul-based change.

So for example the person who's smoking decides to stop smoking. They stop smoking but they still feel like they'd like to have a cigarette. (Laughs) That is an indication that nothing's changed at the soul level - the cause of them desiring the cigarette in their soul had not changed. It's like a person who wants to drink to get drunk all the time; if the change hasn't been made in the soul, then you'll feel drawn back into that pattern of behaviour, no matter how much of an intellectual change you've made.

This is why New Year's resolutions don't work very well, generally. Most people sit there on New Year's day, or New Year's eve and they go, "Oh I want to change my life, I want to have some new experiences this year that I haven't had last year, I want to be more good to myself and ...," Usually it's after a whole couple of weeks first of being bad to themselves they get to this point. Then what they do is they go, "Okay, I'm going to make some resolutions."

Usually by two or three days into the New Year, most of those resolutions are out the window and the reason why is that we can intellectually think our way through things as much as we want, unless there's going to be some soul-based change, no change is really going to be very easy to engage.

**Mary:** So unless we have a big cry on New Year's eve, or New Year's day ...

... about the subject that we want to change, it's highly unlikely that the next day, there will be a change.

**Mary:** Okay, "I always see that there's an emotion within me when I'm out of harmony with Divine Truth."

Yes, so let's say in my intellectual analysis, my logical analysis, I see that God does a certain thing, but I don't do it, or God seems to have an understanding a certain way, but I don't seem to have that particular understanding. Instead of trying to change my mind on the subject, I need to change my soul on the subject. And the only way that a soul can change is by going through an emotional experience of releasing the error to absorb the truth. I understand that, I don't avoid that. I don't think myself away from that, I don't try and intellectually reason that I should be able to avoid the pain of the error, I don't try to get away with the error. I allow myself to go through the experience, that's what I would do if I had a soul-based understanding of this quality of God's Truth.

I would also choose actively to feel the emotional experience rather than choosing actively to avoid it. So I see a lot of people doing that \- there's a choice actively to avoid it. We start discussing a truth, the emotion starts rising in the person of error, the error starts coming out and they start shoving it back down (laughs) and suppressing it. Well that's because there's no soul-based understanding of this particular Divine Truth - that all of God's Truth is going to have to be felt. You're going to have to allow the emotional experience.

**Mary:** Yes, absolutely. So we actually want to identify and experience the emotions that are out of harmony with love.

Yes in fact it becomes our first point of concern in every aspect of life. So let's say something bad happened to us today, let's say we had a car accident. Instead of trying to fix this accident from an intellectual perspective, or fix the results of this accident from an intellectual perspective, I am going to be focused emotionally on, "Why did this accident occur?" There's got to be something in my soul that caused this particular thing.

If we look at it from the perspective of a disease, a lot of people catch severe diseases, something like AIDS, or cancers or heart disease, or diseases are life threatening, what they have a tendency to do is go and change their life, but not change their emotion. Now if you change your life, sometimes it will trigger some changes in emotion and therefore some benefits. But a lot of the times if you don't change something emotionally, you will continue with your cancer, your cancer will worsen, or your AIDS will worsen or whatever disease that you've got will worsen, it won't improve. It can only improve by releasing the emotional error that creates it.

And while I'm focused intellectually on changing my diet, changing my day-to-day practices without going through any emotional experience, it's highly unlikely I will find a cure, except medically. But if I go through the emotional experience it's highly likely I will be cured. But we need to understand that the fact that we've got a disease is telling us how shut down we are emotionally, so it's already telling us how resistive we are to experiencing the emotions that create the disease - otherwise the disease wouldn't have gotten created.

So the fact that we have the disease is an indication that we have huge amounts of resistance and huge amounts of addictions to go through, that we have up to that point in time been unwilling to go through, and we need to be willing to go through it if we're ever going to have a soul-based change on the subject.

So even if I had a headache, my first port of call wouldn't be a pain killer, my first port of call would be, "Okay, what emotion am I suppressing now?" Like, "What experience out of harmony with God's Love and Truth have I had inside of myself that I'm not allowing myself to feel about, that's causing this particular headache that I've got?" That would be my first and probably, once I understood this truth, my only port of call with regard to trying to solve the problem.

The majority of people don't do that. What the majority of people do instead is they instantly look for the physical cure and then once they have the physical cure, they have no desire to find the emotion and that emotion in going to stay within the soul, preventing the access to God's Truth. I find that very unfortunate, so this is something we need to understand with regard to this particular quality.

**Mary:** So following on from that I suppose is, in your notes, "I do not intellectually deny, nor falsify my own condition to myself."

Exactly, so I'm not there telling myself that, "The accident that happened today was caused by somebody else." I'm not there telling myself that, "This disease that I've got can be cured physically." I'm not there telling myself all the errors from God's perspective, I'm telling myself the truth: everything has an emotional connection there's a reason why I've got this particular thing, or had this particular experience that's been painful. It's always going to have something to do with my emotion - always going to have something to do with it. And I will want to know what that was instead of trying to find out some intellectual solution.

It surprises me still that people who've come along to sessions about Divine Truth for five or six years still try to have the intellectual solution. And this is an indication of how frightened they are of their emotional experience and also how they do not yet understand this basic quality of God's Truth, that without the emotional experience you cannot receive God's Truth actually.

So my feelings are I want to go through the experience, not avoid it. Why would you want to avoid it when the emotional experience is the only way you are going to discover the truth? Why would you try to avoid the emotional experience, if you knew that? Of course you wouldn't.

So every time that we are trying to avoid the emotional experience, we are really reminding ourselves, that we as yet do not understand Quality Thirteen of Divine Truth, this quality that Divine Truth, God's Truth, has to be felt and experienced, before we'll be able to understand it.

**Mary:** Yes. Okay, "I emotionally understand that I cannot teach the Divine Truth if I cannot feel it."

Yes well it makes sense that if I cannot feel Divine Truth personally in my soul and therefore automatically act upon it, then I'm pretty hypocritical attempting to teach it to somebody else. Obviously I'm just teaching them an intellectual concept, because the only way they are going to learn God's Truth is to go through an emotional experience that I have yet to go through. (Laughs)

So any person who attempts to teach another person God's Truth, while at the same time denying their own personal emotional experience is basically a hypocrite. They do not yet understand the importance of the emotional experience and Divine Truth is all about the emotional experience. So yes it's impossible really to teach another person something that you yourself have yet to personally experience.

You might be able to say to them things like, "Well I've been told that ... but I've yet to experience it. I think that the reason why I'm yet to experience is because I can feel this emotion inside of me of error that's telling me to do the other thing." We could maybe say things like that, but we can't be dogmatic about what is God's Truth, or firm about what is God's Truth, without having gone through the emotional experience ourselves. And if we are, then I would suggest to the person that their dogmatism or their firmness is not based around love, or their personal experience, but based around some other kind of fear that they have.

**Mary:** Yes, and related to that, "I emotionally understand that I cannot assist another with truth if I am yet to feel it myself."

Yes, so how can you help another person understand the truth about themselves when you're yet to go through the emotional experience, understanding the truth about yourself? I see this happening constantly with people.

There are a lot of people engaging mediumship for example who do this. They are telling other people what they believe is truth, or what the spirit believes is truth, when the person who's the medium has yet to go through the experience.

Now it's highly unlikely if that's the case that the person who's the medium is actually saying the right thing to the person who's yet to go through the experience as well. The medium first needs to go through the emotional experience themselves and now they are open to the truth. And in being open to the truth they are then going to attract spirits who are also open to the same truth - that Divine Truth has to be felt - and they won't be focused on telling the person something about their life that's completely a furphy or something that's misleading. They'd be more honest and truthful about what's really going on for the individual.

It's impossible to assist somebody else when you're yet to go through the emotional experience. So just give up doing that. (Laughs) Stop believing that you can teach somebody else how to love unless you have learnt how to love yourself. Stop believing that you can teach somebody else about some kind of God's Truth, unless you've felt that truth inside of your soul, because if you haven't felt it inside of your soul, it's impossible to teach it.

**Mary:** Okay. Last one, "I understand that unless I feel, my understanding of the Universe will be flawed."

Exactly, this is one of the infinite things that we need to understand about emotion: emotions are such that they can grow infinitely. So in other words our soul has been made by God to receive God's Love, which is an emotion, and this Love that we receive from God transforms our soul in its capacity to receive more truth. In other words without love and emotion, we don't have the capacity to expand and therefore receive more and more of God's Truth.

Now if we really understood that, we would see that there's going to be a limit to our intellectual understanding of the Universe, if we don't engage emotionally. We're going to understand certain things, and be fascinated by certain things, but in the end there'll be a ceiling beyond which we will never be able to go, unless we go through some kind of emotional experiences.

God has made it that way that there are certain parts of the Universe and certain parts of your own self that you cannot understand at all with your intellect and you must go through a personal emotional experience to understand. Now humankind does that pretty naturally from birth, but unfortunately by the time a child is seven years of age, generally that's been heavily suppressed, that experiential process. That's our problem - because we've now suppressed it and we believe the intellect should dominate, we have now prevented our universal and infinite expansion of our own soul, and that is a sad fact unfortunately.

So there are many people who are very intellectually clever and intellectually aware who have very little emotional experiences of God's Truth and they will remain in such a condition until they allow themselves to start going through the emotional experience. When they do their capacity to understand, even intellectually, will grow beyond that point, because their soul engages the process far differently to the intellect. As a result it creates opening pathways inside of the soul that allow us to absorb more of God's Truths, because we have now absorbed enough love to understand them.

In other words we've come to be in harmony more and more with the Universe around us, because we've come to be more loving, and as a result we've come to understand more of God's Truth than we understood before. And in fact if you don't transform with regard to love, you will not understand - there are certain things that it's impossible to understand in fact. It doesn't matter how much you exercise your intellect - you will not understand them. It's only when you engage this emotion of love that you'll actually be able to understand them.

So if we look at that particular quality and see again it's a pretty important quality to understand from an emotional perspective, to understand how to determine truth, and perhaps if we give some examples there again.

Every single time something rebels against us emotionally, in other words we feel like, "That's not right, that's not just, that's not loving," then it's highly likely that we need to examine it under those circumstances. Now it could be that our sense of justice is skewed, that our sense of love is skewed, so that's the very first place we need to call. If we feel those emotions and then if we're not connected to God on those particular subjects it's highly likely that we'll find out that our sense of love is skewed, or our sense of justice is skewed, but once we've gone and actually maintained a connection with God, with God's Love, we'll be able to determine quite rapidly what the truth will be on any given subject.

**Mary:** Yes, obviously sometimes even some of our sense of justice and logic is very skewed, isn't it? Even someone saying the truth to another person often people feel that that's not loving and they have an internal rebellion, and this is where you're saying we need to analyse really what's going on for us emotionally, before we assess.

Exactly, so if we logically assess it we go, "Okay all the person was doing was telling me what they believed was the truth," and we've got to analyse the feeling. Were they trying to do that because they are trying to attack us, or trying to pull us down? What's their history? Have they always been loving? The way they deliver it - were they yelling and screaming when they delivered it, or were they being condescending? Or were they being arrogant when they were delivering it, were they being condescending towards us? Were they trying to ridicule us and make us feel bad? Well no. Then all he did, or she did, was try to tell us a truth.

If I feel bad about the reception of it, so let's say it was a husband and a wife, and the wife goes up to the husband and says, "Do I look fat in these jeans?" and the husband goes, "Yes, you look pretty fat in those jeans and in fact, you've been looking pretty fat lately actually." If he delivered it in that way with love and care for her, then if she gets all upset about it, then she's got to first go into, "Wow, why have I gotten so upset?" and most of the time our worth is tagged in to our body weight it seems sometimes (smiles) and as a result we have to work through why that has happened - what particular thing has happened to cause that emotional experience? And we have to understand that that would have to be an error from God's perspective.

So there are ways that we can determine what is true and what isn't true, by asking ourselves those particular things. But if a person comes to us and they're yelling and screaming and abusing us and ridiculing us, and trying to pull us down and attack us and we feel that, then it's highly unlikely that we need to even listen to what they've got to say, from God's perspective, because they are not in a place where they can tell us any truth. They're not in a place where they can show us any truth. These are emotions that they are going through that are out of harmony with love and out of harmony with God's Universal Laws of love, and as such we can dismiss the fact that we need to actually listen to those particular people, in that moment.

Mind you, there are times when people get upset and angry when they actually have a point. So if we were truly loving to ourselves, we would ask, "Do they have a point?" and we would work through that issue personally. But we wouldn't respond with rage ourselves, because every time we respond with rage ourselves, it's an indication that there's an emotional error inside of us that we need to look at. So look at it, allow yourself to go through the rage, not directed at the other person, go home, feel the rage, feel the experience, get to the fear and the grief that's underneath that you're trying to deny, emotionally trying to deny. Go in that direction, because that's the only way to solve these particular problems. It's the only way to bring yourself into more harmony with God's Laws.

**Mary:** Mmm, alright. Thank you very much.

3. Quality fourteen. What do you mean when you say, "Personal 'truth' must be faced before Divine Truth can be found"?

Yes, probably the best way to say that, would be to say that personal error must be faced before Divine Truth can be found, because most of the time the thing that prevents us from receiving Divine Truth into our soul is the error that we're in on particular subjects, whatever those subjects are.

Now what I mean by that is, that we need to understand that our soul, while it contains the error, is exercising its will to resist God's Truth. And unless we are willing to face our personal error, what we believe is true inside of ourselves that's actually error, and remember it's an emotional experience, so we have to face it and experience it emotionally; unless we're willing to do that, we will not be able to find God's Truth on that particular subject.

So this is basically how we use our will - we need to learn how to use our will to allow ourselves to face all of the things about ourselves, inside of ourselves.

Now remember that this personal truth, or we can call it personal error, depending on what type it is, exists as emotions, desires, passions, longings, it exists as intentions within the soul. It doesn't exist as an intellectual concept; it exists inside of our soul, that's the thing that's preventing us from receiving more of God's Truth.

So we have to face what's really inside of our soul; not what we want to be inside of our soul, or what we prefer to see inside of our soul, or what we hope is inside or our soul, or what we hope everybody else thinks is inside of our soul or any of those things; instead what we need to do is face what is really inside of our soul. What is really there, what is really there as our intentions, what are our real intentions, not what we hope to think our intentions would be or what we hope that everybody else believes our intentions are, but what they actually are and what about the condition of love that's inside of my soul; not what we hope it to be, not what we hope everybody else thinks it is, but what it actually is.

That's what it means to face the personal truth and error - this quality, quality fourteen, is saying we must face this truth and error within our soul before we can receive God's Truth about any particular subject inside of our soul - until then we're just hearing the words.

So this has been the problem for many people coming along to our seminars. They come along to the seminars and they hear the words, "Da da, da, da da" and I speak a long time, as everybody knows by now. So they hear a lot of words, and some of which they retain, but very little is retained because there is very little openness in the soul to examine the personal truth or the personal error that's within the soul from an emotional perspective.

So it's like the truth is presented and it goes in one ear and as the saying goes, out the other. (Laughs) It doesn't get stored anywhere very frequently because there are all these emotions of error inside, intentions and beliefs of error that's inside the soul, that have yet to be experienced emotionally that have to be experienced emotionally before the truth can enter, and we've got to learn to face this personal truth.

Now what I see a lot of people doing is they have a huge desire to know God's Truth on a certain subject, and at the same time they have no desire whatsoever to understand their personal error on the same subject. Now this is not very conducive to receiving God's Truth, because unless you understand and feel and experience your personal error on that subject, you will not ever really know God's Truth on that subject. It's impossible in fact to know God's Truth on a subject while your personal truth is still inside of you dictating what the outcome is going to be. It is an act of will, the use of your soul's will to change that; at some point you've got to be willing to examine yourself completely honestly, completely truthfully, with no holds barred, you've got to be willing to go through that process.

The majority of people who hear Divine Truth are not willing to go through that process for many, many years and the reason why is because they have all sorts of judgement about the process. They want to live a happy life - they think they can manage a happy life without releasing error, which is not actually true. So there are a lot of beliefs that are in the soul of the individual generally that prevents Divine Truth from entering them, no matter how much you speak it.

So this is why I've spoken Divine Truth to some people for five years and during that period of time none of it has entered them and that's because they have not been willing for it to enter them. There have been emotions inside of their soul that they are unwilling to experience that prevent them from experiencing or receiving the Divine Truth inside of their soul. And because the Divine Truth hasn't been received in their soul, nothing can change, and if nothing can change then it means they become the same person they were five years ago. And then they go, "This doesn't work." Well of course it doesn't work if you use your will to block the process. It's never going to work that way, ever.

**Mary:** I used to think or used to say I felt this is such a beautiful system, actually as God engages with us as a very loving parent, He's desiring for us to know ourselves and in order to know ourselves we have to face ourselves. And I suppose in all honesty I used to feel that that is a beautiful thing that God loves us so much that He doesn't just want us to know Him ...

Or to make out we know him.

**Mary:** Yes, but He actually wants us in that process of coming to know Him, to actually find the beauty inside of ourselves and really heal ourselves. Now living that, really in all honesty I find it very confronting to face some of the things that are actually inside of me, the emotions of error that are inside of me and ...

And they must be faced if we are going to receive more Divine Love and if we are going to receive more Divine Truth. This quality is basically saying we must face these things we don't want to face in order to receive more Love and Truth; we must face them. And we must choose to do it from our heart not from our head. We can't force it, we can't force the process, we have to go through the process as engaged from the longings of our soul to do it. It has to be an emotional experience that we engage fully with awareness at the emotional level.

**Mary:** And again intellectually I can see how beautiful a design that is, I can see the beauty in that design that God is actually asking us to develop our will in this very sincere way as we come to know Him.

Because it means we really change, it means that we really grow, it's not all fake, it's not all just a facade, it's not all just learning something that we're not really interested in. We have to be interested in it to learn it. That's the beauty of all of God's Truths - you must be interested with a passion to learn it and in fact there is a quality of the soul that says that if you're not with your passion interested in one of God's Truths you will not receive it. It's impossible for you to receive one of God's Truths when you have no real interest in receiving it.

**Mary:** Yes. Alright so from your notes here, you say, "If our personal emotion is in opposition to Divine Truth then we cannot feel Divine Love completely."

That's correct. So if we think of our personal emotions, remember our emotions, our intentions, our beliefs, our passions and desires, these are all a part the soul; these determine the will of the soul. So when we use the terms "will" or "long for God's Love using your will", to "long for God's Love", we're basically saying that we have to use our passions, our desires, our beliefs, our motivations, our intentions in harmony with that; that's what we're saying. We're going to have to bring all of these things into harmony in order to have an expression of our will where we long for something.

Now when we truly long for something, we will receive it, most people forget that. They go, "Oh, I'd like to receive some Love from God. No I'm not really feeling anything, God mustn't have wanted to give it." No you didn't want to receive it yet. You've got a block inside of yourself emotionally that prevents you from receiving it yet. Find the block, what is the block?

One of the blocks could be just apathy that you don't think it's going to be worth anything to you in the end, that can be a block. There are all sorts of blocks. Another block could be that it's not possible, that it's impossible. Another block could be disillusionment; these are all blockages that we need to allow ourselves to feel before they'll release and therefore allow - after they've been released - allow the truth to enter.

**Mary:** You listed quite a few examples here that we should go through them.

Yes I feel so.

**Mary:** So if I believe myself to be worthless and unlovable.

Yes so a lot of people say to me, "I've longed for God's Love but I don't receive any," and I go, "Okay. Are you sure you've longed for God's Love? "Oh yes, I've longed for God's Love." "Do you believe yourself to be worthless and unlovable?" They go, "Yes, I do." "Well if you believe that, how can you say you long for God's Love?" The real feeling coming out of your soul is, "I'm worthless and unlovable." That's the prayer, that's the statement that's going out to God, "I'm worthless and unlovable." So what's that saying to God? "Don't bother loving me, I'm worthless and unlovable."

**Mary:** And this is where you are saying that personal emotion is actually in opposition to Divine Truth.

It is in opposition to Divine Truth; from God's perspective you are lovable and you're worth everything. You're more important to God than any other physical thing God's created, other than other people's human souls; that's how important you are to God. So you're worth more than the Sun, you're worth more than the Earth, you're worth more than any other thing in creation, according to God, other than any other person.

So while you're believing you're worthless and unlovable, you've now got an opposition emotion. Your emotion is in opposition to God's Emotion. Now the only way you can get rid of an emotion that's in opposition to God's Emotion is to feel the emotion. So you are going to have to feel why you feel worthless and unlovable. You are going to have to feel the pain of that. Once you feel the pain of that emotion, now when you have a longing for God's Love, you're going, "I'm worth something and I'm potentially loveable, would you be able to give me some love?" And of course some Love can flow into you from that place, because you're now open to receiving it.

**Mary:** Because you're in harmony with Divine Truth on that issue.

Because you're in harmony with Divine Truth on that issue, but also because you now have an opening in your heart that's saying "I am worth something and I am worth being loved and I desire that love," whereas before you were saying, "I'm not worth anything, I'm not worthy to be loved, I don't really want love," that's what your soul was really saying.

At some point your soul has to change what it's saying. It's not your intellect that prays for love, it's your soul. So you've got to be willing to change the feeling inside of your soul. And if the feeling inside of your soul is, "I'm worthless and unlovable," you cannot receive God's Love in that place, because it's in complete disharmony with truth from God's perspective. From God's perspective you are worth everything and you are worth being loved and until you are willing to give up "I'm worthless and unlovable" by feeling it, you will not receive the truth from God that you are worthy and lovable. So that's an example of how your personal truth or your personal error has to be faced before God's Truth can be found.

**Mary:** Okay, another example. If I believe I'm better than other people.

Okay, let's say in my soul there is an arrogant sort of feeling of superiority, "I'm better than you, I know more than you. I'm worth more to God than you are. I'm worth more to other people than you are," you know that kind of a feeling. Well that feeling is in direct disharmony with God's Truth on the subject, because God's Truth is you're worth the same as every other one of God's children, not more, the same, that's God's Truth.

While you have inside of your soul this arrogant superior feeling saying that you're worth more, you will not receive God's Love, you cannot receive God's Love and you cannot receive God's Truth in that place, on that subject. God's Truth is you're equal. You're going to walk around with this sort of arrogant feeling of condescension and disapproval, superiority over other people, you're going to walk around with that, everyone around you is going to feel it and God knows that you are out of harmony with God's Laws. You are not going to receive God's Love in that place. You might receive some nice pandering feelings from spirits, or something like that, who are not very good in their condition, but you're not going to receive God's Love, because your soul is using its will to remain directly out of harmony with the truth.

Now how do I get rid of that? Only by feeling my own arrogance, feeling my own superiority, feeling where it came from. What got it there? Why do I believe I'm so important, more important than everyone else? A lot of times it means we were treated with a certain degree of favouritism as a child over other children and things like that, and so we grew up to believe that we are better, as a result. Or our intellect might be more clever than somebody else's and so we believe we're more clever because of that. Or you know we have a certain scientific bent and we believe that's better than other people; or whatever it is that causes us to remain in this arrogant condition. Whatever it is, it needs to be felt and released, because if it's not felt and released, this personal truth isn't felt and released, God's Truth cannot enter you. God's Truth, which is, "You're equal to the other person," won't enter you.

**Mary:** Okay, next one. "If I believe that I can keep breaking God's Laws without penalty.

Yes. I see a lot of people thinking that they're longing for God's Love, not receiving anything and then thinking that it's all God's fault, and basically that they are doing nothing wrong. Well no, the fact that you're not receiving God's Love when you think you're asking for it means you're not asking for it in a way that God designed, or it means that you are already breaking God's Laws - of which you're conscious of - and you have no intention to change.

I see a lot of people in that state, having no intention to change. You can speak to them like until you're blue in the face about the particular subject they face and they have no intention of changing it. Therefore their soul's will is being used to not face it's own personal truth, it's not faced its own personal condition and in that moment. What's happening is they are blocking the reception of God's Truth, they are blocking the reception of God's Love as well, and that can continue for... I've seen it continue for thousands of years.

Some of my friends from the first century are still in the hells because of that one particular problem, because they believe that they should be able to get away with breaking God's Laws and also receive God's Love and improve and be in a nicer place and a nicer condition in the spirit world. It doesn't work that way. None of God's Laws allow it to work that way in fact, which is great in fact.

**Mary:** It's a very good thing, isn't it?

It's a very good thing and yet the majority of people on Earth believe they should be able to manipulate law. So you get the average person who gets caught for speeding, they want to find a way out of it. The average person wants to manipulate their way out of something happening.

You can't manipulate any of God's Laws. Once you've broken the law a penalty is automatically imposed. Bang, there's nothing you can do about it. You can't go to God and say, "Oh, I'm sorry, can you just let me get away with that, I'll do better next time." None of that will work with God. Most people on Earth think that it will and they think that it will because they've been brought up with that, they got away with things with their parents when they were little, they got away with things in society as they were growing up, so they now think that they should be able to get away with things, depending on what they believe is right or wrong. You can't stay in that state and receive God's Truth - it's impossible.

**Mary:** I've heard recently quite a few people that we know saying, "Yes well I know I've got that issue, but hey, I'm in a pretty good space emotionally. I'm no worse than anyone else here," and that's really a way of just avoiding the laws that they are consciously breaking, isn't it?

Yes and I feel quite sad for a person who says, "I'm no worse than anyone else here," because basically what they're saying is, "Everyone else here's in the hells, because basically that's the general condition of the Earth's population and I'm no worse." Well I don't think that's a fantastic thing - what I mean - to me I wouldn't be bragging about that, I'd be saying, "Yes, I'm no worse, that means I'm not in a lower hell than everyone else," but you're still in the hells. What's the point of that when you could be acting in harmony with love? Those kinds of comments come from people who are using their soul's will to have no desire whatsoever to grow in love. They just want their current addictions met and they have no desire to grow in love, otherwise they wouldn't say those particular things. A person who truly wants to grow in love never says those things in fact.

**Mary:** Yes. Okay here's another example, perhaps a little bit more confronting. "A person suffering child abuse who refuses to work through the issue emotionally."

Yes, so this is one of the difficulties that a lot of people on Earth face, being abused as a child, either violently or sexually. The problem with such abuse is that we grow up trying to stay away from it emotionally, we grow up trying to disconnect from it emotionally. Now the only problem with that is that our soul is using its will to disconnect from its own emotion.

Now if God's Truth can only be experienced emotionally, it will be impossible for the emotional experience of God's Truth to enter that soul while that person is denying its own emotional experience. In order to grow towards God, this person who's been abused will need to choose to feel its emotional experience of what happened in its past. Now that can be quite a difficult process to go through, but essential, because if it doesn't do it, it's going to be in denial of its own emotion and therefore in denial of any new emotional experience.

As I've discussed in the "How The Soul Functions" series of questions and answers, the soul isn't built to selectively choose one emotion over the other. If you choose to shut down a large portion of your life... and a person who's shut down from abuse generally is shutting down their entire sexual life and their entire life with regard to fear, there are huge areas of shutdown and we cannot expect to continually receive God's Love while we remain in that condition.

We're going to have to open to those emotions. Now while a person may want some help to do that, or want to go to a therapist to get some help to do that, they can still do it all with God by themselves, but they will need to be willing to go through the process. So the process of feeling our emotions is independent of who caused them; whether we caused them through our own choices or whether somebody else caused them. If we choose using our will to shut down the emotional experience, we are not going to face our personal truth and if we don't face our personal truth God's Truth cannot enter us, God's Love also cannot enter us under those conditions.

**Mary:** It's often quite confronting too for people, isn't it? We see a lot of people holding onto things from the past because they feel, "I didn't do it, why should I have to go through it?"

And when you think about it that is really an angry statement, it is a state of anger going, "I didn't do it to myself, so I shouldn't now have to go through it," is really being angry with the person who did do it and it's really being angry with God or anything externally. So you're going to have to own and feel those emotions. When you start feeling those emotions you'll start receiving some love, that's the reality, because God's Truth can enter you.

You get to the point where you realize that, "Ah, I realize all of a sudden, that without my feeling of my emotions, no one else can do it for me. No one else can actually feel my emotions for me, no one else can have my experience." And once you realize that, you realize that all of the emotions that are stored within you, whether they came from your own poor choices in your life, or from somebody else abusing you or harming you - all of those emotions are now in you and only you have the power to release them. Nobody else can do that for you and in fact that now gives you the power to change.

If it were dependent upon other people then it might be even dependent upon the person who abused you, which would mean that you'd have to wait until they change before you change, and that wouldn't be very fair. The way God has made this system is that you must change for God's Love to enter you; for somebody else to have God's Love enter them, they must change. And God has made this system very wisely that allows you to get total control over your own personal life, so that's a very good thing.

**Mary:** It is, yes. And something I think not many people think of.

Not at all, because when you're in a state of anger when you feel like you want to blame other people, you often don't think about the other side of the issue from God's perspective. That is the truth that God created everything perfectly so that you, between you and God, can have a relationship and you need no one else and that's fantastic. You don't need a priest, you don't need the abuser to repent, you don't need anybody who's harmed you to repent, you just need to go through your own process of forgiveness and repentance with God and that's all.

**Mary:** Okay, a couple of other points that I think you've covered. "We cannot avoid the feelings of personal truth and at the same time receive Divine Truth."

Yes that's fairly obvious. While I'm trying to avoid my personal truth and remembering my personal truth is emotional - desires, passions, intentions, belief systems, everything that's inside of me - while I'm avoiding the reality of it, avoiding being honest about what's there, God's Truth can't enter me because God is honest about what's there. So while I'm avoiding honesty about what's inside of me, I am in direct opposition to God's Truth entering me. I'm using my soul's will to block the reception of Divine Truth.

**Mary:** It's really so simple, isn't it, and yet as you've mentioned previously, simple for a child to do to be honest, and yet we create all of these blocks toward such a simple process, don't we?

Yes it's simple but as an adult who's learnt over many, many years to deny the truth about themselves in particular, learned over many years to shut down their emotions, learned over many years to deny love, obviously there's going to be a lot of blockages to the process as an adult, which although it's a simple process it becomes a hard process, not easy, because of all of these blockages. So we are going to need to work our way emotionally though all of these emotional blockages. All the anger that we have about doing it, and then all the fear we have and then eventually all the grief will flow out of us. And once that happens, then the receiving process is very, very easy.

**Mary:** Okay, final one you have here. "Feelings that oppose love and truth must be released by experiencing them before God's Truth can enter us as a feeling and experience."

Exactly, so this is just an extension of what we've been saying - feelings of love and truth that are out of harmony with love and truth are the blockages.

**Mary:** So just again, feelings that are out of harmony with love and truth are the blockages.

Are the blockages, yes, to receiving God's Truth and receiving God's Love. So the only way that I can let go of these feelings that are out of harmony with truth and love that exist inside of me is to feel them. Now it doesn't make them true, it just means that I have to feel the error that's been created that now exists within my soul.

Once I feel this error, now the error leaves me and the wall that blocks me from receiving truth has now been deconstructed. Now there's no wall and truth can flow easily as soon as I long for it. If I have a sincere longing for it the truth and God's Love will flow, but I need a sincere longing for it still. So I need to let go of the error and to do that I need a sincere desire to do it; I have to let go of the error and then I'll have to choose to long for the Love and Truth from God. before the truth can enter me. And that is me facing my personal truth, so that I can then receive more Truth from God; and that means me letting go of all the things that are error inside of me that prevent me from receiving this truth from God.

**Mary:** Mmm, yes, great.

4. Regarding quality fourteen, "What does a soul-based understanding that 'personal truth' must be faced before Divine Truth can be found", look like in my personal life?

Well firstly I would always be seeking to know what's really going on inside of myself, not what I hope's going on inside of myself, or hope everybody else sees, or what the facade is, but actually know what is really going on inside of myself by feeling it. I would not avoid that process of feeling what's going on inside of myself. I would want to know more about myself, whether somebody who's in a better condition of love than I am can tell me, that would be fantastic, I would actually look forward to them telling me rather than trying to avoid what they say.

I would allow the Law of Attraction to expose to me what my real condition is through the law. So instead of ignoring what happened today, I'd be looking at what happened today? What does this show me about my soul that's out of harmony with God's Truth, that's out of harmony with God's Love? What inside of my soul is causing these particular problems?

It could be two sets of issues. It could be issues relating to being attacked all the time, which is related to self- love, or it could be an issue where we're willing to attack others or harm others, and that's an issue of loving others. Either one we would need to address and we would look at honestly what went on inside of our soul. We would look at what we've attracted during the course of the day with regard to everything from the way insects integrated with us right the way through to the way other humans worked with us - we would examine everything.

We would examine everything: what's going on in my relationship with God, have I received Divine Love today - because if I haven't then it means that I'm blocked - I need to face some personal truth; there are some more truths that I need to discover about myself; pray about wanting to know what are the truths. Or is the truth on a certain subject? Or are the truths regarding our entire person? Pray about knowing those particular things; develop a personal longing inside of yourself to know - that's what you would do if you lived in harmony with this quality.

You would realise that without going through this process of finding out what I really am like God's Truth can't enter me. God's Truth is what I really am like - when God's Truth enters me it will tell what I'm really like. If I'm resisting knowing what I'm really like how can God's Truth enter me? It can't, so I would see this as a primary priority in my life. I wouldn't put it on the back burner and just try to have fun every day and do a two minute analysis at the end of the day. My whole life would be focused on trying to bring my life into harmony by feeling what's going on inside of me as it really is, not as I hope it to be.

**Mary:** Alright, do you want to talk about some of the things from your notes?

Yes. Thanks.

**Mary:** You've covered a lot of this in your intro, "I have a strong desire to see myself as God sees me, rather than deny or ignore my emotional truth."

Yes, so we've got to remember that God's Truth is how God sees the Universe. Now because you're a member of the Universe, you're in the Universe, God's Truth is also going to be about how God sees you. Now if you're unwilling to feel about how God see's you then you're not going to be in harmony with God. And if you're not in harmony with God, you're not in harmony with God's Laws and you're not in harmony with God's Love, so you can't expect to receive God's Love or God's Truths in that space.

So at some point you're going to have to come to terms with the fact that how God sees you is the most important thing. So I need to know how does God see me, I need to start to try to understand it intellectually but more importantly, once I see how I feel about myself is not the way God sees me, then I'm going to have to change a feeling inside of myself. That's going to have to be something that I choose to use my will to do. No one else is going to force me to do it. I'm going to have to choose to use my will to do it and that means that I'm not going to get pushed by somebody into doing it; I don't have to get helped by somebody to do it, I need to choose to do it for myself.

Now if I did that I would be living more in harmony with this quality, in that I understand that this personal error is a major blockage to my relationship with God, and if I really badly want my relationship with God, I am going to want to know what my personal errors are.

**Mary:** Yes. Okay, "I do not resist what God is showing me through the Law of Attraction, rather I embrace it." You talked about this.

Let's talk about it a bit more. Embracing the Law of Attraction is a lot different than what most people do. What most people do is resist almost totally what the Law of Attraction has brought them in a particular day. Remember the Law of Attraction operates upon your soul, so it's really telling you what your real soul condition is. But what most of us finish up doing is we create a life where we circle ourselves with comfort, we don't engage anything out of the normal and that's what we're used to. The reason why we do that is it helps us avoid what we've attracted, what we would normally attract if we didn't engage this comfort, and that's why when we go travelling for example we get more triggered, more emotionally unstable generally. The reason why is because there is more opportunity for us to notice the differences as to what the Law of Attraction is bringing us, based on what our soul condition is.

So we need to be engaging new things in the course of a day and doing new things, engaging new people and doing all sorts of other things in the course of a day. If we truly loved the Law of Attraction in this case, what we would do is we would want to engage it. We wouldn't be spending our life trying to avoid it, we wouldn't be spending our life afraid of it, we'd be wanting to engage it because it's God's messenger of truth to us; it tells us what God feels about us.

Remembering that all of God's Laws are perfect and therefore all of the operation or the Law of Attraction is perfect, it's telling us the truth about ourselves. So if we're getting attacked for example it's telling us that we don't love ourselves very much. If we're attacking other people and other people are getting angry about our attack of them, then it's telling us that we're not very loving to other people very much and we need to see these issues of love as they truly are - errors within our soul - and allow ourselves to release them. In fact if we really understood this quality we would want to see them and we'd want to release them. We wouldn't want to avoid them.

**Mary:** Yes, okay. "I do not try to falsify a position of Divine Truth when I know my personal truth is very different."

Yes, so in other words I don't try to "fake it until I make it", which is a saying that is in the world that's very prominent and very prominent in the New Age movements. "Fake it until you make it"; it's also very prominent in most religions, "Fake it until you make it", type of thing; fake it until you believe it, or until it becomes a part of yourself.

It's not the way to proceed, God is never fake with us, God knows your real condition, the best course of action with God is to not fake anything and to be who you really are and see who you really are, warts and all. And if that means seeing a whole heap of bad things about yourself initially and having to come to terms with that, then allow yourself to do that. Stop trying to falsify yourself with God, it's not going to work, God already sees everything and God's waiting for you to see what God's sees, that's part of really receiving God's Truth, you seeing what God sees.

So allow yourself to go through this acknowledgement of what's really inside. Allow yourself to see what God is seeing inside of you. Now God sees a lot of good things that you can't see and God sees also a lot of things that are not very nice, that you think are fine - that's the reality. So God sees positive things about you that you think are negative and God sees negative things about you that you think are positive, and you're going to have to change on both positions if you're going to become in harmony with God's Truth.

**Mary:** Okay, "I do not try to hide from myself or others my true desires even when they are unloving."

Yes, so in other words I allow myself to go, "Wow, I really don't like that person," and I don't hide that from myself, I don't try to make out that I do like them. I go, "Yes I don't like them, let me feel why I don't like them. What's going on inside of me that causes me to not like them? What's the emotion that's driving me? What's my personal error that's inside of me that causes me to hate my brother or dislike my brother, or not enjoy their company?" or whatever it is. "What's going on inside of me?"

When I'm truly in harmony with this quality - this quality of facing personal truth - I'm going, "Wow, that's true, I feel like that about that person, wow that's not very loving," but it's not a judgement of myself. I've got to go, "Okay, I'm not very loving there, what do I want to do about it?" Do I want to feel the reason why I'm not very loving, or do I want to ignore this and just make out that I'm fine?

Now as soon as you choose to ignore it, you've got to understand the ramifications; you choose to ignore, you can't receive Divine Love anymore and you won't receive Divine Truth anymore, until you choose to acknowledge that's the way God's Laws work with regard to the human soul and truth and love.

So when I'm choosing to ignore what I really am doing inside is I am automatically blocking the flow of Love and Truth from God into my soul, and I've got to see that rather than try to make out that everything's fine. And the best way to see that is look at your life today and then look at your life two or three or four years ago, and ask yourself, "Have I really changed? Do I feel differently, do I feel more loving, am I treating people more lovingly? Do I feel more positive, am I treating people more positively? Do I feel more desire for truth, am I longing for truth more? Do I feel more desire for God's Love, am I longing for God's Love more?" And have an honest assessment of yourself today and yourself four years ago.

How much time do you spend doing those particular things? And most people will find that four years ago and today there's very little difference, aside from their location. (Laughs) Perhaps, or the person they are with or whatever, but aside from that there are usually many of the same feelings inside the soul as there were four years ago. Now if that's the case it means that during that four year period of time you have not faced much personal truth, you have been unwilling to face personal truth.

The primary reason why you haven't grown - the only reason in fact - why you haven't grown is because you haven't wanted to know about yourself. So stop that. Stop not wanting to know and start wanting to know. You know start absorbing the truth about yourself. God's got plenty of things in the Universe telling the truth about yourself.

**Mary:** Minute by minute.

Minute by minute.

**Mary:** Presumably in that what you're saying about not hiding yourself or your real feelings, presumably there's the sort of three conditions we can be in. One is the facade and really wanting to hide that from everyone and ourselves. The second is sort of what you referred to, which is acknowledging and like taking responsibility for it.

Feeling your injured self, but wanting to still be your injured self. A lot of people stay in that place.

**Mary:** Okay. That's the one I was getting to.

See I feel like there's the facade, which is not even wanting to know what you really feel, making out that you're someone different than you really are, so that's always going to be a problem. But then there's a second thing where you're actually feeling you're injuries, but not wanting to actually do anything about them, not wanting to change, not wanting to grow in love, in fact you want to rebel in that place a lot of times. To me that's feeling the injured self without any desire to become more loving.

**Mary:** Yes and I suppose I see people being quite abusive in that state, because they abuse the principle of truthfulness and say, "Well no, I've given up my facade, this is how I am right now."

"I'm just a bitch and I don't care, you've got to put up with it," and that's very unloving, in fact what you're doing is more damage to your soul in that place.

**Mary:** And telling people "truth".

Yes, going around saying, "You're this and you're that and not even examining truthfully your own personal motive for doing so, which most of the time is to pull them down so that you feel better about yourself. So the reality is you're not being very honest about yourself in that place really, you're still in a facade in some ways, you're not really feeling your own causal emotion. So most people start being honest about their causal emotion but still choose to not feel it.

To truly be honest about your own emotion inside of you, you have to feel it. So a lot of people have a facade and then they get out of their facade and start to see what they feel. Like they start to feel what they feel, but they have no desire to truly feel it. They have a desire to rebel against it and get angry with the world and all that stuff. That's improvement over a facade, but it's not more loving.

The reality is you're now in a destructive phase and if you continue on your path of destruction your soul's going to get even darker, if you stay in that destructive phase; so it's not very helpful for the development of your soul or to progress in love. You need to get out of that and go into this willingness, a desire to feel your true self, that's a desire to feel your injured self, your true injuries, without blaming anyone else, without projecting it on to other people, without damaging other people with it. That place very few people have reached at this point.

**Mary:** Yes and perhaps it's for another discussion, but I feel there's a lot of blockages and things people come up against in moving to that ultimate third state which is really facing personal truth, which is humility.

I don't feel that's the ultimate state. The ultimate state is the fourth state, which is coming to see yourself as God sees you completely without any injuries.

**Mary:** Of course, yes.

That's the real state that we were created in, the state that we can grow towards and the state that we can become at-one with God in. So that's where we're headed, but you can't go to that state by jumping some of the others, generally. Of course I do feel that you can jump the state where you feel the injury and then go, "Stuff the world, I'm just going to stay in these injuries," you can certainly jump that state. That's just an exercise of your will.

**Mary:** Yes, I'd like to talk to you some time about that, because I often see people in that second state without seemingly any sense of morality or ethics.

I agree, which is a huge problem if they ever want to become more loving.

**Mary:** Yes. Or on the other hand, where I suffer, is where I see that and I then judge myself, which ...

Which is also not ethical. (Laughs)

**Mary:** No, because I'm treating myself badly.

Well not just because of that, the majority of people have errors within them because of somebody else doing something to them. There are only two reasons why we have errors within us generally: one is that we've made choices that are out of harmony with love, or two that other people have made choices towards us that are out of harmony with love. Now for the majority of us we have a mixture of those things, so if you judge yourself, you're not always honouring the second thing, which is that other people may have damaged you, caused many of the things that are now damaged within you and you're not being truthful about that, so that's not ethical either.

To be ethical you've got to be balanced right across the board, that means that I am responsible for only the things I chose to do out of harmony with love; other people are responsible for what they chose to do out of harmony with love towards me. I am responsible for feeling all of my emotions, I need to choose to feel both sets of emotions. So these are the things we need to understand if we're truly going to be facing our personal truth.

**Mary:** Yes, okay. "I have a willingness to be humble at all times, seeing that my personal truth is often not loving."

Yes. So humility is remember firstly the ability to feel all of your own emotions, whether they are loving or unloving. Secondly humility allows you to examine yourself, honestly as God sees you. So it's a desire to examine yourself as God sees you.

Now if we examine ourselves as God sees us and we find oh, there we see something, humility would also then by extension go, "I want to feel why I feel this." I would want to go through the experience of feeling this error so that it can leave me. Humility would dictate that, so while many people have heard the definition of humility, very few are practising it.

To practice humility you have to feel, you have to have an emotional experience, and this is where most people fail when it comes to the path towards God. That's why religions got created in fact, because many people did not want to feel and then as a result they want to believe rather than feel. They want to believe in something rather than feel what they have to go through to become more loving themselves. They don't understand that the true religion from God's perspective is love - that's the true religion. Now that's not a doctrine, if you want to think of it a different way it might be called a doctrine of love, but it's not a human doctrine, it's God's definition of love, that's what true religion is. And if we choose to not feel, we are automatically choosing to be out of harmony with that definition.

**Mary:** Okay, final one. "I feel that I must release my personal truth - error - to get closer to God."

Yes, so the truth doesn't have to be released really, does it? So I have to release the personal error in order to get closer to God. I know and understand that if I live this quality I know and understand that with all my soul. I understand, "Wow, I can't get closer to God by acting differently, by taking some different actions, by saying different words, by ignoring truth about myself: I can't get closer to God. The only way I can get closer to God is by feeling my own personal emotions and feelings, which are my 'personal truths' if you like, even though they might be truth and error. I'm prepared to feel them, that's the only way I will get closer to God and that's what I need to remember from this quality."

If I allow myself to go through that process I will always come out of it in a new state, I will always be closer to God, I will always be closer to truth, I'll always be able to love more easily. If I'm still finding love very difficult and hard to achieve, I'm still not understanding God's Truths, I'm still not acting in harmony with God's Laws, then it means that I'm finding love really hard. And the only reason why I find love hard is because there's something inside of me that causes it and so I need to choose to feel that particular thing, and if I understood this principle I would choose to feel it. I would choose to face it, because I want to get closer to God.

5. What do you mean by saying, "we need to be totally immersed in Truth"?

Well this is a state that I feel that many people who first hear about Divine Truth and Divine Love don't understand very much about, because they don't understand the sincerity of the state. This is being so committed to understanding not only external truth, but internal truth, that you spend most of the time in your day-to-day life investigating it. So I think the average person who hears anything spiritual generally spends very, very little time investigating it. What they might do is they spend a bit of time hearing it and then they don't spend much other time, they just get involved in their day-to-day life until the next day, or the next few days and then they look at it again and do the same thing.

When you're totally immersed in truth it's not like that. If you really desperately want to have a relationship with God, and you desire that relationship with all your heart, you will want to be totally immersed in truth every single day of your life. You'll want to know what God's Truth is every single day of your life. You won't be avoiding it any single day of your life, you won't try to have a happy day in order to avoid it; you won't also try to have a sad day in order to avoid it; you won't try to do anything in order to avoid discovery of more truth. You won't create your lifestyle so that it avoids the confrontation of truth; you won't stop being with different people to avoid the confrontation of truth - to personally, I mean - to avoid the confrontation of truth.

You will engage every single thing that happens in your life, every email, every Facebook interaction if you have Facebook, every personal interaction with a person, every phone conversation, every interaction with nature, every interaction with your day-to-day life at work and at home, every interaction with your children, with your parents, your family, your close associates, your extended associates, and general people in the world, every interaction will be you wanting to know more truth. That's what it means to be totally immersed in truth.

Now the average person I feel who even hears about Divine Truth is not engaged in discovery of truth in that manner; remember to do it you would also have to engage it understanding all of the qualities of Divine Truth that we've just discussed - all the fourteen qualities and attributes you would want to engage in this process. The majority of people don't want to do that.

**Mary:** No just a single one can be quite confronting.

Exactly, for the majority, we're lucky if we're even engaging one of the aspects or qualities of God's Truth in our day-to-day life, let alone the whole fourteen every single day.

**Mary:** In your notes here you've written some statements that are actually what it would be like if I was totally immersed in truth. So perhaps I could read them and you could comment. So, "I'm totally immersed in truth, I've learnt that when I act in complete harmony with what I know to be God's Truth I am also acting in complete harmony with God's Laws of love, this means that I give each situation I am personally involved in the best potential for the best possible outcome.

I feel this is very important again as an exercise of our will. What I notice people doing is they almost explain away why they have acted out of harmony with what they know love to be. They say things like, "Oh, I'm not that developed yet," or "Oh, well in this situation I didn't feel it applied." There are all sorts of internal justifications that people have.

When we are totally immersed in truth we understand the importance of truth in our day-to-day life, so much so that we see that every time we act in harmony with truth, we are acting in harmony with law. That gives every single event that you're personally involved in the best possible outcome for everyone involved, not only yourself but every single person involved who's involved in your life in that particular interaction.

By engaging this particular law you have honoured the fact in your soul that you are giving everybody the best possible gift, every single person around you. Now that to me is a wonderful show of whether a person is acting in harmony with truth, or totally immersed in truth.

Instead what I see happening a lot of times is that people justify the error constantly, they justify why they should continue believing the error, they justify why they should continue acting the error - acting out of harmony with love and acting out of harmony with truth. They say things like, "Oh, it's not a perfect world and I'm not perfect yet," as a justification for acting out of harmony with love and out of harmony with truth. These are all signs that you're not totally immersed in truth, because if you were you would not be ever saying these particular things.

**Mary:** And there's a big lack of understanding that every step we make towards God's Truth and acting in harmony with that truth actually maximizes positive potentials for everyone.

Exactly. So it's the most loving thing we could do.

**Mary:** Yes, absolutely.

And that is the thing that I feel that a lot of people are forgetting about truth. When they act, you know dishonestly or they don't tell the truth, or they don't act in harmony with the truth, they are basically choosing to not love and every time you choose to not love you are damaging your soul. You are actually doing something more that you are going to have to at some point in the future compensate for.

So you can see why most people never reach at-onement with God while on Earth, because in the course of a day there are many justifications for choosing to act out of harmony with love, which means that even though they might have a longing for God's Love in the morning, during the day they have chosen to act out of harmony with it, which now has caused additional damage to the soul that would need to be compensated for and it's very, very damaging to yourself and to other people of course.

**Mary:** Yes. I know just observing others and even from my own life, sometimes we just come up to a relatively small fear and in that moment we choose to dishonour what we know to be truth or God's Laws in that situation and actually by doing that, by stepping away from just perhaps short term. I sometimes say to people like, "Three seconds of discomfort really, we actually create like three months of difficulties, Law of Compensation, having to look at what went on," and actually the converse is true, isn't it? When we act in harmony with truth we maximise the positive potentials. When we choose to ignore what we already know because we want to avoid a little bit of discomfort maybe then we actually generate a whole heap of negative possibilities for everyone involved.

Not only that, those negative possibilities could potentially go on for months or even years, and even centuries, depending on the different choices that people make. So this is what we need to understand about error: error not only causes a problem in the moment, it causes a problem for the rest of the person's life until the error is addressed, whereas truth not only has a benefit in the moment, but it has a benefit to the person for the rest of their life.

**Mary:** And everyone else.

And everyone else. And if we really understood that about truth we would never avoid it.

**Mary:** Okay, next one. "I've learnt to be in personal truth at all times, with all people and under all circumstances, no matter what the potential outcome will be, because I will then be in harmony or be brought into harmony with God's Laws, which support my acting in harmony with love and truth.

So when we look at this particular subject what is it that you feel about it, when you read it?

**Mary:** Well, in the statement it is inherent that it's at all times and with all people there are no exceptions, so it's across the board, I've made a decision when I'm immersed in truth that I will always be truthful and also here you're saying, I might be just truthful about my personal truth, and that might have to be corrected, but by engaging in this way I allow the possibility of that correction to happen, rather than just avoiding it.

Exactly. A lot of people use the excuse that, "Oh I didn't act that way because I don't know for certain whether that's true or not." Well my suggestion is, do what you think is the truth at the moment and then let the law, God's Laws of Truth, correct you if you are wrong. If you were humble you would choose to do that, you would do the best with what you currently know. You wouldn't choose to not act, you wouldn't choose to avoid; you would choose to do the best with what you currently know. Then you would be open to change showing you that maybe what you currently knew wasn't enough and you would let yourself go through that process.

So it's a bit like the child when it gets up to walk. The child doesn't go to itself "I'm not going to try to walk because I'm going to fall over." The child says, "I'm going to walk because there are a lot of advantages in walking. I can scoot around now, I don't have to wear out my knees, it's a lot easier to get around, I can climb higher; there are a lot of advantages to walking." So the child doesn't choose to stay crawling just because it's afraid of walking.

Now if we look at the average person when it comes to truth, many times we choose to stay crawling when it comes to truth, rather than get up and walk because we're afraid of what walking might do.

**Mary:** We're afraid to fall over.

We're afraid to fall over, we're afraid to make a mistake, and honestly living a life based around fear of mistakes causes a lot of damage to your soul. You're actually causing damage to your desires and intentions, you're causing damage to your passions, you're causing damage to your personality because you're suppressing your personality. So it's very, very damaging to your soul to choose to do that.

Now the child when it gets to try to walk, it doesn't do that, it just gets up and it knows what it wants and it goes for it, even though it possibly knows that it might fall over doing it. It'll just get up and try over again. We often as adults don't have that same attitude, because we're afraid of dealing with certain emotions.

**Mary:** Yes absolutely. Right next one. "I've learned to state God's Truth at all times, with all people and under all situations, no matter what the potential outcome will be, when given the opportunity to do so by others and their own exercise of their own free will."

This is saying basically that I choose at all times in all circumstances in all situations to share what I know is God's Truth on any matter and I choose to live it, in every situation.

**Mary:** Presumably this is truth that we've felt, because we can't receive it any other way.

Well we wouldn't probably be living it without feeling it, but even if it's something that we know to be true, but don't feel just yet, I would still choose to do it. That's the reality, because I honour the fact that I know it, but not yet feel it, I know that there are errors in me that cause me to not yet feel it, but I would allow the process to expose the error. So I would even choose to do it then.

So if I know that yelling and screaming at somebody is not a loving thing and yet I still feel like yelling and screaming, I wouldn't yell and scream at them, because I would choose to do what God's Truth would dictate to me in that particular situation. Not my own truth, my own truth would say, "Yes go and have a good yell and scream at them." God's Truth says, "No, no don't do that because you're going to damage people that way, you're going to damage your own soul that way," but the second half is the important thing, so if we re-read the second part.

**Mary:** "When given the opportunity to do so by others and their exercise of their own free will."

Yes, now this is what many people forget. People give you an opportunity through the exercise of their will. You have no right to share truth with others except when you're personally engaged in it.

So in other words if you're in my life, I now must share the truth, because it's my life. But if you're involved with say, Igor, who's behind this camera in front of me at the moment, and you want to engage Igor with a certain truth and it's none of my business at all, then I have to wait until you or Igor express a desire to know the truth before I can share it with you. That's honouring the free will of the individual.

So I notice very many things going on around us that are very much out of harmony with love and truth a lot of the times and I say nothing until placed in the situation where one or more of the people involved has asked me about the issue. Then I say everything possible (laughs) that the circumstance and their will, will allow me to say, while honouring my own love of myself in the process. That's what we would do if we were totally immersed in truth.

**Mary:** Alright, point four. "I've learnt to live my life fearlessly in truth at all times. I'm no longer governed by personal fear and personal fear becomes subordinate to the higher importance of living in harmony with God's Truth."

Yes this is an extremely important thing to understand. To be totally immersed in truth we have to be prepared to subordinate our fear to God's Truth. Most people are not prepared to do this. This is the reason why the majority of people who have heard Divine Truth do not progress - because they are unwilling to subordinate their own fear.

In other words if we draw it like a diagram or an illustration, imagine if God's Truth is here, the majority of people have a certain level of fear associated with living or practicing that truth above that. That means that their fear dominates everything; the fear is not subordinate to the truth, the fear is the 'God'; it's the thing that determines what will happen. And the truth is subordinate to their fear unfortunately.

What we need to do, and what we would do if we were totally immersed in truth, is we would purposefully subordinate the fear, we would make the fear be less important. We still might have a lot of it, but we would view it as less important than honouring the truth emotionally inside of us. We would feel that it's more important to honour the truth even though I'm afraid. That's what we would do in every situation.

So there are some situations that I'm very afraid still, because I've still got some fear in me about certain situations, and yet I still choose to engage the truth, because the way I see my fear is that I must always make it subordinate to the truth. I feel it, I let myself feel my fear still, I let myself honestly feel what it's about, but I still act in harmony with what the truth dictates and not in what my fear would dictate.

**Mary:** And really what I observe you doing is that there might be a level of fear within you, but because of your honour of truth and really your embodiment of just about everything that we've talked about in this entire series, fear naturally becomes subordinate; not because you've released some fear but because the truth is so honoured by you.

It's more important to me than anything.

**Mary:** Because the only way we can reduce our fear is to release it, isn't it, but we can still honour truth above that fear, can't we?

Yes. So this is about not where you fear level is, it's about where you place your honour of truth. Now most people I observe place their honour of truth below their fear. So in other words they're prepared to be honest and truthful as long as they're not afraid.

Most people do not honour their truth above their fear - in other words even though they're afraid they're still truthful. Most people don't do that. The difference between myself and most people is that single difference often at times. The truth to me is of supreme importance, next to love it is the most important thing in the Universe, and in fact in some ways it's just as important as love, because it leads you to love - it leads you to a greater love. So you could say that love is dependent, to a large extent, upon you absorbing more truth. This is why truth is so important in your life.

Now if you place it as this very high priority in your life - number one priority in your life - you'll eventually be led to God, who will eventually become your number one priority. You'll be led to love; you'll be led to humility; you be led to a lot of other things; if you place it as a high priority in your life and you honour it. It's when we dishonour it, or when we view our fear as more honourable or more important, or as a higher priority, that we get ourselves into extreme difficulties when it comes to our progression. We also eventually choose to do things that are very damaging to our soul when our fear governs our action.

So to be totally immersed in truth we have to learn to subordinate fear and that doesn't mean to suppress it. You've got to feel it, you've got to feel the emotion of it, but not honour it, not do what it dictates, and that I feel is a very important part of being totally immersed in truth.

**Mary:** Well that's all I have on my page to discuss with you today. It's been really enjoyable talking about the qualities of Divine Truth.

So just as a general comment to everyone who's been listening about the qualities of Divine Truth. Hopefully going through the qualities has enabled you to come to understand how God's Truth actually works and how you personally can start to discover God's Truth for yourself, because all of these attributes and qualities of God's Truth are an important part of anything that's presented to you.

So allow yourself to see what's presented to you in the world - whether it's a religious thought, a philosophical thought, a political thought, or any other type of teaching - allow yourself to be presented it. Then analyse it through those qualities and ask yourself, does it have that quality about it? Does it have this quality about it? And you will find if you do that you will find it very much more easier \- well I feel it will be a lot easier for you to come to determine what is God's Truth in comparison to what is just mankind's ideas.

The world is full of millions of ideas, the majority of them are mankind's ideas. With a lot of these men's ideas, you can say almost all of them are not God's ideas, therefore not God's Truths. So what we need to do is come to see how to determine what is God's Truth in comparison to mankind's doctrines and ideas. And I feel if you just apply those fourteen rules to anything you examine, you will be quite easily able to throw away a lot of things as not being God's Truth because they are just obviously mankind's ideas and they don't match the qualities of truth. And you will also be able to accept a lot of things that mankind doesn't accept because they will become very plain to you as being God's Truths. So hopefully this discussion has helped you go through that process in a much more active manner.
