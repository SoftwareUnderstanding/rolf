#  Scene 1

It's morning. Too late for scrambled eggs, grits and sausage. Too early for an all American burger with a side of crispy, well done fries. The time on my cellphone reads 10:42 am.

"Oh, shit! I'm about to be late to the airport. My flight leaves at noon and I ain't put none of my luggage in the car."

Let me introduce myself. I'm Sasha. A finance manager by degree, an author by purpose, best friend to a few but my most major designation is being what everyone else needs. Whether it's a shoulder to cry on, a loan officer, psychiatrist—I transform like the chameleon for those I hold close to my heart. Somewhere during the whole cycle of winding myself up to tick at everyone else's command, I decided to stop transforming and start living. So my friends and I decided to plan a girl's weekend trip.

Now normally I travel by way of car to experience all the road has to offer—big trees, wondrous colors in the sky— the backdrop to nature sometimes. I have never been on a plane a day in my life, but today was going to be the day that changed that. Who knew that this whole weekend would end up being a life changing experience?

I've been living in the South for what seems like an eternity but has only been my entire life. At times I've wanted to escape this slow moving scenery. Lemonade, sweet tea, biscuits and cornbread was all I knew. I was secretly wishing that life would grant me the opportunity to experience something different. This was my change to take advantage of this opportunity.

My girls and I planned this trip to Vegas about six months ago and well, I'm nervous and excited at the same time. Yeah I'll miss my family, but at some point, I've got to get out of the South and have a life outside of being that chameleon. I don't drink or club, so why am I going to Vegas? Let's find out. Wait! Let me answer my phone first.

"Hello—"

"Hey girl, it's Mariah. What time does your plane leave?"

"It leaves at 12, but I haven't even left my house yet."

"What you trying to do, get left?" We both laugh so hard tears begin to flow.

"Shut up, girl. I'm all packed up now. I sure wish Chassidy and the other girls were able to join us; Maybe next time."

"Yeah—me too girl. Listen, as soon as I stop by granny's place I'll be headed to airport. I can't wait to see yall."

"I can't wait either. Bye Mariah."

I straightened my black hat, check my black sweatpants for lint and any other thing that wants to linger and take an uninvited plane ride, wipe off a little dust from my black Adidas and make my way to the airport.

The time is 9:55 in the am hour. Not as warm out yet as she would like, but it's nice enough out to let her cat, Myna, go take her morning stroll around the back porch. Mariah is ready for the world this morning. Dressed in all black too, Mariah Let the cat back in, grabbed her purse and heads for the door.

"Let me make sure all my lights and shit are turned off. Almost forgot my damn hat."

She waved bye to her cat. "I'm out" and threw deuces to the wind.

Mariah, the interior decorator and stylist to the stars, became friends with Sasha and the rest of their crew a few months after Life Behind the Beats came out in theaters. She definitely loved her some Shawn. After she finally quit her insurance job, Mariah decided to start her own business in interior design. She already had a portfolio and somehow it ended up in the hands of a celeb stylist and the rest—well, is history.

"Oh— my— God! Move out of the way. I got somewhere to be." Traffic was always bad around this time of the day; horns honking and everybody wanting to go to lunch at the same time. "I just wanna get to my grammy's house, make sure she straight, then head straight to the airport. I can't be late— Not today."

Mariah finally arrived to grandmother's house. Everything seemed to be in order. She walked around, gave life to her plants with some H2O. "Bye Grammy. I'll see you when I get back. Love you." She planted a kiss on her grandmother's head and walked back out the door.

"I'm so glad that I'm gonna be away this weekend. I need a break—tired of all these people in my face, invading my space. I gotta get my sanity back."

Clothed in a black hi-low shirt, black jeans and boots, Elan was ready to get out of town. A mother of two, she really needed a break. What better way to break than to enjoy it with your girls. No kids, no work, no interruptions. This was exactly what Elan and the girls needed.

Elan ran down the stairs. "Got my phone, my purse and all my bags are in the car. Let's get this show on the road."

She left the house and in record speed she arrived to the airport, gathered her things and headed for her flight. The smell of burning rubber, babies and strange people penetrates the airport. People standing around, gazing like deer caught in SUV headlights, some are reading the flight list, others standing at the vending machines eating made to order snacks.

"Hi. May I see your ticket, please?" the red-headed flight attendant asked.

"Here you go and here is my license too."

"Vegas, huh? Seems like a nice trip. Enjoy your flight."

"Thank you."

Sitting on the plane, flight 777-J, with her earphones in bobbing to the music, "I was running through the 6 wit my woes." I love that song. I'm about to be running through Vegas with my woes." She giggles. "This shit about to be lit. I hope none of my boo's call me this weekend cause I ain't answering. Let me straighten my hat. This Tequila got me feeling good already."

Jade was the wild one in the group. If you've ever seen a group of women out together and that one friend always has to get carried out of the bar that would be Jade. Some may call her rowdy, but to them, she was the life of the party.

Jade recently graduated from college and was ready to take over the world. Hell, she had already started. Right before graduation, she got a job working with some nice people. She was a writer too. She sold a couple books here and there. To be so young, she was decorated, educated and had a lot of mouth lol.

"Please buckle your seatbelts and watch the announcements on your screens for more instructions. Enjoy your flight," says the flight attendant

Everybody made it on time to their flights. All the girls were dressed in all black. It was their default color because it made them look so good and accentuated their hips, dips and everything in between. Besides, it would be easier to spot each other once their flights landed.

As he took a sip of his water sitting in the LAX airport and looked down at his watch, he noticed that his friends hadn't arrived to the airport yet. Chauncey, Julian, Shawn and Alec had just finished doing press tours all over the globe for their newly premiered movie, Life Behind the Beats. They had been surrounded by cameras, lights and microphones for nearly six months now. All he wanted to do was go somewhere where he could rest, relax and take it all in.

Life as he knew it had changed. In an instant, he went from being able to go buy a pack of pineapple Now and Laters from the corner store to being chased down the block by complete strangers just to get a picture with him. He couldn't shop on his own unless it was late night—you know the hours where you can't tell if it's a man or woman standing on the street corner.

"Damn, where these dudes at?" Chauncey looked down at his phone again, "We can't be late. Not today."

A bunch of laughter and noise erupts from the far end of the airport.

"Nigga, what are those?" Julian says

"Man what you talking about? You ain't heard? Curry made the special for ya boy." Shawn responds

"This nigga is a Curry stan. I bet he got Curry on speed dial," says Alec

"Hell nah," replied Julian

The guys laugh all the way until they get to Chauncey. Chauncey's face had no emotion on it at all.

"What's up bro?" Julian says

"Nothing man. I thought yall niggas was gonna be late. I'm ready to get the hell away from LA for a while." Chauncey says while giving his brothers their famous handshake.

"Man, I'm so ready to get to Vegas. Imma find me a sweet lady, spit this LA rap to her and have her tweeting about me for a month," Shawn says while flashing a smile and holding his gold chain. Shawn was a crowd pleaser. Like bees to honey, his personality always drew the ladies in. Son of a nationally known face, producer, director and actor, Shawn sought out to make a name for himself. He did just that with Life Behind the Beats.

"We bout to be outchea. Ya heard me," says Julian. Julian, New Orleans native with a smile that could brighten the darkest part of Africa, went from the bottom of the Old Bay barrel to being crowned king of his own personal throne.

"Aye, they calling us. Time to get on this plane and head to Vegas," says Alec. Alec: noble actor, man of class and style and the most gorgeous, soul stripping eyes a man could possess. More seasoned than the others, he can be found lingering in the background but he's full of laugher with a fiery personality.

Everywhere the guys went together they dressed in all black. It became sort of their thing since the movie came out. It suited them all so well. The guys showed their tickets, checked their bags and hopped on the plane. It was take off time. Occupied by books, earphones, FaceTime and movies, they all got settled on the plane and waited for take-off. The ride would surely be smoother than butter on a fresh baked homemade biscuit in the south.

#  Scene 2

Stepping fresh off the plane, the guys stretched their legs, looked around the antique-laced Vegas airport. People of all shapes, sizes, colors and creed packed the place. More Elvis impersonators than hands and feet could count.

"Vegas muthafucka" Shawn screams

"About got damn time", says Alec. My legs were getting kinda cramped sitting down for so long. Let's get our bags and—"

"Hey, there goes the shuttle for the hotel." says Shawn

"A nigga need to use the restroom, ya feel me?!" says Julian

"Julian you gone have to wait, man. Let's get to the hotel and check in before we get noticed out here." says Chauncey

"Yeah, you right Chauncey. At least I'll be in my own room so I can piss in peace," Julian says

The guys laugh in unison. They load their luggage into the shuttle and head for one of the most beautiful hotels in Vegas, Palazzo Resort Hotel.

"This thing takes forever. I just want my damn bags so we can go— about time." Elan says while she grabbed her bags from the baggage claim area. The lines were long and the bags seemed like they went around the globe twice and stopped for drinks before getting to her.

All of the ladies grab their luggage and head for the front doors of the airport. Jade ran out the door waving her hands like an angry black woman looking for revenge on her estranged lover. "You muthafucka! I know he saw me waving him down."

"Was that the shuttle for the hotel, Jade?" Says Mariah

"Hell yeah it was and this nigga drove off fast as hell. I know he saw me." Says Jade

"Don't worry about it, Jade. Here comes another one. We staying at the Palazzo Resort, right?" Says Sasha

"Yeah, that's where Nadya booked us at. Too bad she and the others couldn't make it. That was a hell of a discount we got." Jade says

"You ain't never lied. Let's get on this one and head to the hotel" says Sasha

The girls load up their luggage into the shuttle, buckle their seatbelts and head to the Palazzo Resort hotel. Large palm trees lined the streets. It was daylight out but the glamor of the buildings still outshined even the stars that line the sky.

Long strips along the sidewalks paved that yellow brick road to each hotel, designer store and justice of the peace. Large billboards with faces of well-known comedians, singers, actors and the like hung in the corners of the skies landscape. Vegas was truly a country inside of a country.

#  Scene 3

The men arrived to the hotel in record time. Everybody checks in, receives their keys and head to their rooms. Julian was relieved because he really had to piss. All of their rooms were located on left end of the 15th floor of the hotel; all the way to the end of the hallway. They booked it that way so that they could maneuver in and out, being very discreet.

Julian finishes his restroom session, washes his hands, and checks his face in the mirror. "You clean as hell if I do say so myself," Julian says to himself while looking in the mirror. "I think it's time to get a drink." Julian walked out of his room and knocked on Chauncey's door to see if he was settled in yet.

"Chauncey, man you alive in there?"

Chauncey answers the door looking tired and worn out. Eyes glaring low towards the ground, he responds "Yeah man, I'm alright. I'm bout to take a nap for a little bit."

"Aight then, Imma go see if Shawn and Alec wanna go hang out at the bar for a little bit. See if we can scoop some honeys for later tonight."

Yall wild, man. Go head. I'll be here when yall get through. Don't forget tonight we steppin out together. Make sure you suit and shit is ready," Chauncey says with a befuddled voice

"Bro, you know we stay ready."

Chauncey gives Julian the infamous, frat brother-like hand shake and closes his door. Julian bangs on Shawn's door and Alec's door like the police down on Crenshaw and 4th Ave. They come out of their rooms ready to go downstairs with Julian.

"Bring yall asses, man. I need to get a drink." Julian says to Shawn and Alec.

"Yeah, yeah nigga. You just trying to scoop a chick for tonight," says Shawn

"Don't worry about what I'm tryna do. You better be ready for tonight. I already told Chauncey we stay ready. Besides, I got a real good feeling about this weekend," says Julian

"Yeah, you know how Chauncey is. Detailed and time sensitive as hell. We ready. Don't worry bro," Alec says.

Julian, Shawn and Alec get on the elevator and ride to the ground floor. The elevator bell chimes and the doors glide open. The guys exit to the left; going around the corner to the bar area that is located in the back part of the hotel.

Julian orders a shot of Tequila. Shawn and Alec both order Vodkas on the rocks. The men chill out at the bar, enjoying the scenery and watching the game on the TV.

The shuttle finally arrives to the hotel. The ladies had their luggage taken to their rooms while they checked in. They all got their keys and got on the elevator.

"The 15th floor. That's pretty high don't yall think?" Elan says

"Girl no. I'm glad we are kinda in the middle. I bet the rooms are nice. This place is gorgeous," says Sasha

"This hotel is beautiful. Damn! I wish Chassidy, Aliyssa, Nadya and Dominique could have come here with us and shit," says Mariah

"Hell yeah, it is. Its bout to be on tonight. I see they got a bar here too. As soon as I put my things away, I'm coming right back down to get me a shot," Jade says

"You and that damn Tequila," Says Sasha

The girls laugh in unison. Four women with bright smiles, gorgeous hair and bodacious bodies wait for the elevator to arrive at their home for the weekend.

"Ding!" The elevator stopped at the 15th floor. The hallway of the hotels are lined with beautiful paintings. Some vintage and some look like they were handcrafted on sight. Almost looked like a smaller version of Paris on the inside. The girls notice that their rooms were all the way down on the right end of the hallway.

"We in the cut, ladies," says Jade while waiving her hotel room key in the air.

"Damn, Nadya really hooked us up. We all discrete and shit," says Mariah

The girls located their individual rooms and went in to get settled. Everybody except Sasha decides to go get a drink at the bar downstairs. She was tired as hell and needed a nap. That plane ride was one for the books; especially since it was her first time being on a plane. She was jetlag bad. Mariah and knocked on her door.

"Don't sleep to long, Sasha. We got things to do," says Mariah.

"Yeah—whatever. I'm tired. Yall please don't drink too much this early. I ain't ready to be dragging yall asses back to the room."

Sasha closed her door and the other girls head for the elevator. Ground floor. The elevator doors flew open and Jade led the way. Mariah, Jade and Elan sit down at the far end of the bar, hoping to order their drinks and be in peace for a second or two.

Down at the other end of the bar, the guys were chopping it about the game. The smell of a sweet fragrance filled the air. It was pretty early for people to be in the bar so it was somewhat empty. Julian, taking a sip of his Tequila, smiles and looks up right into Jade's direction.

"Who the fuck is that?" Julian says, eyes wide open

"Man what you talking about, J?" says Shawn

"I'm talking about shorty down at the end of the bar. The one in the black", says Julian

"They all in black," Alec says as he and Shawn start laughing, slapping each other on the shoulder.

"Which one nigga?" says Shawn

"The one with the pretty smile." Julian says

"Nigga they ALL got pretty smiles." Shawn says laughing again

"Fuck you nigga. Imma walk down there. I'll show you which one I'm talking bout." Julian got up, fixed his hat and walked into the direction of Mariah, Jade and Elan.

"Excuse me, miss. My name is Ju—"

"Julian Gates. I know who you are. Are you fucking kidding me? You're the biggest star out right now." Jade jumped up, grabbed her half-consumed drink and walked closer to Julian, "What the hell are you doing here?"

"Me and my boys are here for the weekend. Just tryna enjoy ourselves. No press, no fans, no nothing. Just us. I just wanted to come over and tell you that I think you're beautiful and what not." Julian flashed a smile at Jade.

"Thank you."

"I was wondering if you would like to step out with me tonight. My boys and I have reservations at this upscale club. No crazy people allowed. You ain't crazy are you?"

Jade looked at Julian and flashed a smirk. "Hell nah, I ain't no crazy bish. I like my tequila, but hell, who doesn't?"

"That's what's up. Look, my homies down there looking kinda crazy at me. What room are you in?"

"I'm on the 15th floor. Room 1520"

"That's cool— we on the same floor. I'm in room 1541. Listen, Imma come holla at you around 7. Is that cool?"

"Yeah," Jade says with a crackling voice

"Dress to impress, miss— I didn't get your name."

"Jade. My name is Jade."

"Dress to impress ME, Miss Jade."

Jade glances over at Mariah and Elan as they almost choke on their drinks. They were completely struck. Who would have thought that they would end up on the same side of the planet, let alone the same hotel as Julian Gates, Shawn Anderson, and Alec Harrison? Fate would have it to be so. Julian walked back down to his end of the bar and got confronted by Shawn and Alec.

"Aye, J! Man who was pretty chick with the luscious red lips sitting with them?" says Shawn

"I don't know, Shawn. I didn't get her name, but I sure did get Jade's tho. They all on the same floor as us so you know it's bout to be poppin'."

"That's crazy as hell," Says Alec while he rubs the remnants of his growing facial hair. He throws a wondering eye down in the path of the ladies and it lingers in Elan's direction.

"J, man, I think I got my lady for the weekend," Shawn says as he traces the outline of his goatee.

"Who?" Julian looks at Shawn in a confused way

"The beauty down at the end. Miss luscious lips."

"That's what's up." Julian swallows the last drop of his drink, drops the glass on the counter, making the sound of wind chimes. "Listen, yall ready to head back up to the room so we can rest up for tonight?"

I think that's a good idea, Julian. Let's go." Alec replied keeping his view of Elan clear, secretly hoping that she'd look his way and shows some type of interest.

Julian and the guys paid for their drinks. Julian and Alec walked toward the elevator while Shawn walked down to talk to Mariah.

Mariah looks up and sees Shawn coming straight at her like a slow motion scene in Gone with the Wind. She sat straight up, put her drink down and licked her lips.

"I'm sorry; I think I heard you call my name."

"Excuse me? I don't know what you're talking about."

"My name is Shawn. You may know me from—"

"Man crush Monday or some shit!" says Mariah. Jade and Elan chuckle in the background. Shawn just spit one of the lamest pick-up lines they'd heard in a long time.

Shawn flashes a smile while grabbing his gold chain, "Yeah that. Can I get your name?"

"My name is Mariah. It's nice to meet you, Shawn. Is it okay if I call you that or would you prefer something different?"

"You can _call_ me—.anything you want. As you may know, the guys and I are going to this thing tonight and I was wondering if you would like to come with me. I, mean, it could be sorta like a date, if you like that kind of thing. I don't want you to feel like I'm taking up your time with these beautiful ladies right here."

"Sure, Shawn. I'd love to."

"Then it's settled. I'll see you around 7 tonight. My boy Julian said yall are on the same floor as us, so we good as far as finding you later. See you then, Miss Mariah."

"See ya—"

Shawn walked away, smiling from ear to ear. Mariah stood there, breathless, as if she'd just run a half marathon through Times Square. Shawn's plan was in motion. He found his lady for the weekend. He ran to catch the elevator just in time to get on with Julian and Alec.

#  Scene 4

"What in the hell just happened?" Elan says.

The girls couldn't believe that they'd just been in the presence of some of the most wanted men in America. They quickly finished their drinks and ran to the elevator. As soon as they bent the corner to grab the next elevator they were surprised to see who was standing at the front counter. It was Nadya, Chassidy, Alyssa and Dominique.

"Girl—I thought yall weren't coming" Jade says. To their surprise, Aliyssa, Chassidy, Dominique and Nadya made it Vegas—.Just in time to join them in the festivities of the weekend.

Nadya says, "yall ain't gonna believe who we ran into at the airport while waiting for the damn shuttle."

"No! Yall asses ain't gonna believe who just asked me the fuck out tonight," Jade says with her tongue sticking out.

"Who did yall run into at the airport, Nadya?" Elan says

"We were standing outside the airport waiting on the damn shuttle and Chassidy was sitting on her luggage. The shuttle was taking so long I thought we would have to walk all the way up here. We heard a bunch laughing and shit so we looked up—..and there was—."

"The homies are gonna be surprised as hell, don't you think, man?" says Malik

"Fuck yea. I'm ready to tear Vegas up. Bout to get into some real O.G. shit this weekend," Marcus says to Malik

"You ain't tell none of the homies we were coming up here did you, Kadeem?" Malik says

Kadeem throws Malik a side eye sharp enough to make a pitcher strike out in the end zone. "Man, what the fuck do I look like—A snitch, nigga? Hell nah."

"Kendrick, you mighty quiet, bro. What's going on?" Marcus says

"Nothing bro, I just spazzed out for a minute. I'm good. Tryna get my mind together for this weekend." Kendrick says

"Yall see any of the shuttles yet? We at the Palazzo, right?" Malik says

"Yeah, that's the one." Kadeem agreed

Kendrick spots an attractive young lady sitting on her luggage, twiddling her hair and decided to walk over and introduce himself. He was taken back by her beauty and intrigued by her demeanor. Kendrick, eyeing her small frame, walked up her and—.

"Excuse me, I couldn't help but see you sitting down and I just wanted to tell you that I think you're gorgeous."

"The fuck! Oh my bad. Wait. Aren't you Kendrick Parker?" Chassidy says while still sitting on her luggage. Arms folded. Demeanor unmoved.

"Yes, I am. I didn't get your name, gorgeous."

"I'm Chassidy and thanks for the compliment."

"Are you here for the weeke—?"

"Sorry—. Gotta go," Chassidy says as the shuttle pulls up. She hurriedly grabbed her luggage, got on the shuttle with the girls and slammed the door shut as the shuttle drives off.

Meanwhile, the guys were staring at Kendrick while he tried to show off his suave appearance to Chassidy. They clowned him.

"Man, you see this nigga?" Malik says

"We ain't even at the hotel yet and he already tryna lock one down." Kadeem says

Another shuttle arrives. The guys load their luggage inside as Kendrick walks back toward them to join them in the shuttle. He was obviously discombobulated by Chassidy's lack of interest.

"I can't believe she did me like that. Don't matter. I gotta have her. They got in the same shuttle as our hotel. They must be staying there. Watch me find her." Kendrick says to the guys.

They all laugh at him, closed the door to the shuttle and ride off in the wind. Next stop— Palazzo Hotel Resort.

#  Scene 5

"Chassidy— why'd you diss that man like that?" Mariah says

"Shit, he ain't even my type. Something about his eyes—Makes me feel weird." Chassidy says. She shivers as if she's a fish on dry land out of place.

"I don't give a fuck. That's Kendrick Parker. He got money," Jade says, "But muthafuckin' Julian Gates ass asked me the fuck out."

Chassidy, Nadya, Aliyssa and Dominique looked at Jade in disbelief.

"Are you serious?" Aliyssa says

"Julian Gates is here too?" Dominique says

"I wonder what's going on this weekend." Chassidy says

"Shit, from what Julian said, they just chillin' this weekend. Nothing major. But they got this party or whatever they going to and invited me out," says Jade

"Shawn invited me too," Mariah says

"Shawn Anderson is here? Ain't no cameras around? No "pop that paparazzi" anywhere to be found? Oh my fuckin' god." Chassidy says

The girls carried their conversation into the elevator. Chassidy, Aliyssa, Nadya and Dominique stopped on the 14th floor to get off.

"This is our stop ladies. What time are yall leaving out tonight?" Nadya says

Julian says 7, so I guess 7,"Jade says laughing

"Alright well let us know where yall going and we will join you," Dominique says

"That's what's up. We'll text yall later—in time enough for yall to get dressed." Elan says

"—by the way, where in the hell is Sasha?" Chassidy says

"Yall know she got jetlag. Her ass never been on a flight before today." Mariah says

The girls laughed as the elevator door closed.

"I can't wait to wake Sasha up and tell her what the hell just happened." Elan says to Jade and Mariah.

"Is this a dream or some shit? I mean, I feel like I'm bout to wake and be back in my damn bed at home," Mariah says

"Shit, if it is, don't wake my ass up until I give Julian some of Jade. Have his ass believing I'm more than half the reason he still alive." Jade says while putting her finger in her mouth

"You's a freaky mothafucka," Elan says to Jade

"I get that shit from you, E," Jade says laughing

The girls get off the elevator and go off into their rooms to rest up for the evening. Adrenaline running high in anticipation of a magical night with the fellas. Who knows what's going to happen.

#  Scene 6

Chauncey finally wakes up after his long overdue nap. He was fully rested at this point. He got up, washes his face and turns on the TV. Then came a series of beats at the door. It was Shawn.

"Yo!"

"Aye, Chauncey, you alive in there man?"

"Yeah, man. Hold on a second." Chauncey walks over and opens the door to let Shawn in. He sat down in the chair next to the window and starts filling Chauncey in on what transpired in the last few hours.

"You ain't gone believe what we just locked down. I seen this beautiful ass girl downstairs at the bar, right. She was sitting with her friends. She tells me her name is Mariah— Name bout to be mines for the night." They both start laughing while Chauncey flips through the TV channels. "J the first nigga to go down there after he couldn't stop starring at one of the other girls. I think he said her name was Jade or some shit like that. We invited them out to 10AK with us tonight. I think Alec got his eye on the other one. I ain't really see nobody for you, man—.my bad," Shawn says with a smirk on his face.

"Fuck that shit, Shawn. I'm good tho—.just wanna have a good time, relax and clear my mind this weekend."

"That's what's up. Well it's almost time to get ready for tonight. Imma go tap Julian and Alec. Let them know. As soon as Shawn got up to go toward the door, there was another beat coming from the door.

"Chauncey, you got room service already?" Shawn says

"Nah man but check that out tho." Shawn walked over and opened the door. Standing on the other side of that large framed door was Malik, Marcus, Kendrick and Kadeem.

"What the fuck are yall doin' here man?" Shawn says in excitement and dapping them up like a newly crossed frat brother.

"Man, we heard yall was coming this way to get away for a lil minute and so, we decided to pop in and join in on the R and R, dawg." Marcus says

"That's what's up," Chauncey says

"Listen, we gon' go to our rooms, unpack and chill out. What yall got poppin' tonight? I know it's gotta be some dope shit." Malik says

"Man, we ran into some fly ass ladies downstairs at the bar. Figure we'd take em' out to 10AK. Yall wanna roll out with us? We leaving at 7," Shawn says

"Hell yeah, I'm down! Ain't nothing like a nice night out in a decked out club." Kadeem says

The guys leave Chauncey's room and head back down to their rooms on the 14th floor. Unbeknownst to them, it's the same floor as the other four girls. Shawn leaves Chauncey's room too and fill Julian and Alec in on the rest of the crew that just showed up. Everything was lined up for the night. Shawn makes another stop back to Julian's room for a quick blaze.

"I knew you'd have the goods with ya, my boy," Shawn says

"Never leave home without it, homie," Julian says

Julian and Shawn blaze one up, sit and talk like two old men on a Saturday morning reading the sports section of the newspaper then they part ways so they could clean up for the night. Meanwhile, Sasha wakes up, dazed and confused.

"Damn! I ain't mean to sleep that long. Guess jetlag is a real thing." Sasha says, laughing to herself. "Let me get up and make sure the girls are ready for tonight."

Sasha got up and washed her face, checked to make sure her eyebrows and lashes still looked good. She grabbed her cell phone to check for any miss calls or text message. Nothing. "Just like I like it. Nobody bothering me this weekend."

As soon as she stepped out of the bathroom, she hears a knock at the door. "Hold on a sec." She opened the door and Mariah, Jade and Elan come barging in.

"Girl yo ass slept through the titanic. You the reason why everybody drowned on that shit," Jade says laughing

"Damn jetlag got me bad."

"Guess what the hell happened to us downstairs," Mariah says

"Yall drank until you passed out, huh?"

"Man, me and Jade got asked out by Shawn Anderson and Julian Gates. I saw Alec Harrison down there checking Elan out," Mariah says

"Stop yo lying. It's too late in the day to be playing games."

"Hell, that shit was real, Sasha," Elan says, "Besides why would we lie? And I got a plan for Mr. Harrison with his sexy ass," Elan chuckled and hit a split on the floor, doing some kind of stripper routine.

Sasha sat up straight on the bed with the look of shock on her face.

"We couldn't help but notice that Chauncey Hill wasn't with them. Maybe he stayed home," Jade says.

"Too bad, Sasha girl. You could have had a night with him." Mariah says

"Oh, and guess who else showed up?" Mariah says

"Got damn Chassidy, Aliyssa, Nadya AND Dominique," Jade says

"Shit, you for real?"

"Yeah, they surprised the hell out of us," Elan says

"The crew is all together. It's about to be a good ass night."

The girls went back to their rooms to get prepared for the night out with the guys. They had to be ready by 7 according to Julian and nothing would keep them from being on time. Besides, Sasha was a stickler for being on time— Even if it meant she would spend the night by herself watching her friends enjoy their crushes.

#  Scene 7

All the guys were dressed to the nine and were ready to head downstairs to catch the shuttle. The girls, on the other hand, were still putting the final touches on their hair and makeup when Jade got a knock at the door—

"Who the fuck is that?"

"It's Julian. This Jade's room, right? 1520?"

"Oh shit! Yeah. Hold on a minute, aight?" Jade took a quick look in the mirror, licked her lips and opened the door.

"Damn! Baby girl you look good as hell tonight."

"Thank you, daddy. Can I call you that?"

"Hell yeah. I like that shit." Julian yelled as he flashed a smile at Jade. "Listen, me and my boys are gonna get ready to head down stairs. We will leave a limo waiting for yall. They know exactly where to bring yall. Just tell em' you with Julian."

"Cool. I'll let my sisters know."

"See you later, sexy."

"Aight then, daddy." Jade closes her door and finishes her final touches. Jade was decked out in a black romper, suspenders attached on each side with a black crop top underneath and her black Louboutin heels.

Sasha made a quick call over to Elan's room to make sure that they were ready to step out. Sasha wasn't completely done getting dressed yet herself.

"Elan, yall ready?"

"Yeah, we ready."

"Aight. Listen, I still need to put my shoes on so yall go ahead downstairs. I'll be right behind yall in a few."

"Okay, girl. We'll see you downstairs."

They hung up the phone. Elan wanted to be extra sexy so she wore a lacy black dress that hit every curve she had, black and silver bangles to match the silver hoops in her ears, followed by her black Louboutin heels. Mariah decided to keep it simple. She wore a black low-cut, strapless midi dress with a split to keep you guessing and a black leather cropped blazer. It wouldn't be right if Mariah didn't wear a bold ass red lip with her big black cocktail ring, outlined in gold. All the girls decided to carry their handmade envelope purses that were custom made by Sasha and given to them as gifts.

Elan, Jade and Mariah stepped outside of their rooms and checked each other out. Blacked out from the neck down, they smiled at one another.

"Damn, Mariah! Who yo date for tonight? Girl, if Julian wasn't here it would have to be me!" Jade says

"Fuck you, Jade." Mariah says laughing

"We hot tonight sisters." Elan says, "I hope I don't bust my ass in these shoes."

"Girl, you gon' be aight," Mariah says

"Let's get it then sisters." Jade says

They get on the elevator to go down. It stops at the 14th floor just in time for the other girls to join them.

"Everybody dressed in all black and shit," Mariah says

"We lit!" Jade says. Everybody starts laughing

Nadya, Chassidy, Aliyssa and Dominique joined them on the elevator ride down.

"Julian says they have a limo for us—a fucking limo! A big black dick!" Jade says

"I still believe this is a dream or some twilight zone shit, man," Mariah says

The elevator doors fly open to the ground floor. The girls step out and wait patiently for their big black dick to arrive.

Nadya decides to step out in a long sleeve wrap dress with a gold belt. It fitted her petite frame with a long spilt down the right side, exposing her thigh. She had on a dark berry lipstick color and her Louboutin strappy heels. Chassidy wore on a pant suit. Her jacket was open, exposing her black crop top and toned abs underneath. Chassidy also wore gold accessories and black Giuseppe heels. Aliyssa decides to wear a one strap midi dress with no necklace and dramatically long ass silver earrings. Her hair had big curls, giving off 92' Whitney Houston vibes along with her open toe black Louboutin heels. Dominique knew tonight she had to bring it. She wore a short black romper. It was completely covered in the front revealing her toned back. She wore knee high black leather boots and big ghetto ass gold rope hoops. The girls were absolutely gorgeous.

"Chauncey, man get yo ass out the mirror and come the fuck on." Julian says

"Nigga, I'm coming. You can't rush perfection." Chauncey walks out of his door as all his boys were waiting for him in the hallway.

"Malik, dude! What's up?" Chauncey says as he gave the rest of the guys high fives. They all made their way to the elevator when Chauncey realized he left his fitted hat sitting on the bed.

"Damn—left my hat. I'll catch up with yall downstairs man."

"Hurry the fuck up, Chauncey. We don't wanna keep the ladies waiting." Julian says

Chauncey goes back to his room, walking with his head down. As he's walking he notices a lady turning the corner by the elevator. He ponders a bit on who it was, opened his room door and walked in to grab his hat and came right back out hoping to catch another glimpse of her shadow.

"Let me get myself together." Sasha says as she adjusted her pearls and got on the elevator. What she didn't realize is that she just passed right by Chauncey. The elevator opened at ground floor and doors flew open. Everybody stopped and looked. Sasha stood there in a black, strapless wide-leg jumper. Hips giving life to her outfit as she moved. She had pearls dripping around her neck like icicles hanging from an orange tree in mid-winter along with earrings to match. Her hair was up in a beautiful bun and she also wore black Giuseppe heels.

"This muthafucka!" Jade says

"Who the hell is that?" Marcus says to the men

"I don't know but she look she belongs on the cover of a magazine." Alec says, eyes shining bright.

"Damn!" Chassidy says. "I guess when you finally get out of the house you do it up. I ain't mad at ya."

"Fuck you, Chassidy" Sasha responds sarcastically

The rest of the girls erupt in laughter. Everybody was ready to go except Chauncey. Julian helped the girls get into their limo and the driver drives off. As soon as the girls rode off into the night, Chauncey gets off of the elevator.

"Bout time, nigga. Let's go," Shawn says to Chauncey

"Nigga take that hat everywhere he goes. My buddy-ass hat." Julian says and all the guys crack up laughing because it is true: Chauncey never goes anywhere without it. It's like a security blanket.

The men hop in the shuttle and ride over to 10AK. One of the hottest night clubs in Las Vegas. Laced with exotic women, upscale spirits and entertainment galore. They decided to take the shuttle because they didn't want to be noticed. The girls arrive at the club. They get out just in time to see the shuttle pull up with the guys. The girls entered the club through the front, the guys proceed to the back. For the Love of Money was blasting through the speakers as the girls enter. Dr. Dre's verse was on the track.

"Ayeee, This my jam!" Sasha says. Arms swaying to the beat.

"Oh my god, Daddy Dre!" I hope he in here tonight. "Chassidy says

"Sit yo ass down somewhere Chassidy. Dre is a married man and his wife wouldn't let him come near this place." Sasha says. The girls burst out laughing

"Kendrick tried to holla at Chassidy at the airport and she wasn't trying to hear shit he was saying. Ignored his ass like he was the last wing a in the box." Dominique says

"Kendrick Parker is here too?" Sasha says, "Yall ain't tell me that shit."

"Chassidy, imma hook yall up girl," Elan says

"Hook my ass up with Daddy Dre. He's all the man I need." Chassidy says. Lips tooted up to the sky. Everybody laughs

Jade looked up and sees Julian and the rest of the men in the VIP section. Julian motions to her to come up and join them. Everybody sashays toward that way except Sasha.

"Where you going, girl? The rest of us are going up to the VIP with the menfolk." Aliyssa says

"Going to get some water, man. You know I don't drink that stuff yall got set-up up there."

"Alright. Hurry up and make your way up here with us when you get that weak ass water."

Sasha went to the bar to get her drink and to gather her feelings before she went with the girls.

Music blasts. Crowd dances like Morpheus just came back home and its celebration time. Bodies connecting to one another like refrigerator magnets at grandma's house in the south.

"Yo Shawn, Imma go down to the bar and get a drink. I'll be back." Chauncey says

"You don't want what we got up here? We got the best off the shelf, bruh."

"Nah, man. I'll be right back tho." Chauncey walks down the lit stairway to the bar when he notices the same lady he saw when he went to get his hat, only this time it wasn't a shadow. It was Sasha. And in this moment he stood there breathless and frozen. Sasha turned around to walk away with her water in her hand. The room seemed as if it was slowing down, giving time the opportunity to catch up with their bodies. When she saw Chauncey approaching her, she flashed a shy school girl smile.

"You leaving so soon?" He impregnates her personal space with his chocolate brown skin, breath smelling like a bed of mint roses.

"Aren't you Chauncey Hill?" Sasha says with a crown pleasing smile on her face

"Yes, I am. You have a beautiful smile. I didn't get your name."

"My name is Sasha." Wanting to extend her hand to make contact with his, her thoughts to lock with his. Never moving. Still smiling.

"Are you leaving?"

"No. I'm not leaving. I'm actually going to the VIP area. My sisters are up there."

A look of excitement escapes across his face. Eyebrows lifting slightly. "Oh, so you're with them?"

"Yeah, I am."

"Well let me get my drink and walk back up there with you. Is that cool with you?"

"Yeah. Of course. That's cool with me."

Chauncey was so smitten by her exterior, her smile. She felt like a fresh breeze in the summertime in his presence. Holding his drink in his right hand, he grabs her water from her hand and they walked back to the VIP area. As they approach their friends, Mariah yells, "This girl went to the bar and came back with Chauncey Hill—the fuck?" The group laughs so loud the security joined in with them.

"Looks like Chauncey may have met his match tonight, huh? He has that look on his face." says Shawn

"I hope so, bro. He definitely needs to mello out a little bit." Julian says

The girls and the guys were enjoying each other's company. Sipping drinks and choppin' it up. Then the DJ threw on a new track by The Game. Julian gets up and starts dancing like a Cierra backup dancer.

"Come on baby girl. Come dance with me," Julian says to Jade

"Sure thing daddy. Let me put my drink down." Jade sits her drink on the table and follows Julian to the dance floor. "Bye sisters."

Shawn took Mariah's hand and led her to the dance floor. "Let's go pretty lady."

Alec stood up, put his drink down and walked over to Elan. "Hey beautiful. Care to join me on the dance floor?"

"I was waiting to see how long you were going to play hard to get." She flashed a smile and followed him to the floor.

Malik looked over at Aliyssa. She smiled back. "Hi. I'm Malik You—"

"I know you. You're kinda cute too. I'm Aliyssa."

"Well Miss Aliyssa, can you dance?"

"Can you act?" Aliyssa says with a prissy attitude

"I guess that's a yes. Let hit the floor then."

Marcus grabs Dominique's hand and off they went to the floor.

Chassidy says to Nadya, "Girl please don't leave me up here with him." She was antsy about being left alone with Kendrick. He was definitely interested in her, but she couldn't care less. Her sights were elsewhere.

"If this man asks me to dance, I'm going and I'm leaving yo ass right here twiddling your thumbs. You better stop playing and let that man show you some love. You might get some tonight,"

"Shit. I'd rather be in a desert."

"Chassidy, come on sis. Get to know him first before you judge him. He's cute."

We always judge a book by reading the preface or the back panel, never thinking of going further to examine and consume the contents. "Aight. Whatever." Attitude fuming off her countenance like a steam room in a spa.

Kadeem asked Nadya to dance just like she suspected he would and they left Chassidy sitting alone with Kendrick, Chauncey and Sasha. Kendrick slid down the seat and whispered to Chassidy, "You know, you don't HAVE to sit here alone." Kendrick says to Chassidy again, "I just wanna dance with you. Is that alright?"

Chassidy rolled her eyes at Kendrick. Scrolling through her phone like a spinning roller deck on an office desk.

"Ah, come on. Don't make me beg. You're a beautiful lady. I just wanna show you a good time. Can I do that?"

Her scrolling sped up like a horse at the Kentucky derby.

"How about I make you a bet. If you're not enjoying yourself by the end of the night, you'll never have to see my face again. Deal?"

Chassidy looked up, flashes a smile and says, "Hell yeah. That's a deal." They got up and joined the others on the dance floor. Bodies swaying to the music, every note, every beat. Aura of love, lust and memories consumed them all.

Everybody was on the dance floor making lasting impressing in the glossy hardwood and enjoying themselves except Sasha and Chauncey. They got so lost in their conversation that they forgot they were in a club with other people. "I didn't realize everyone left us. Hey, you wanna go dance?" Chauncey says to Sasha as he stood up to take her hand.

"Sure thing Mr. Hill."

"Call me Chauncey, please," as he flashed a smile at her.

"Chauncey—" His name floating off her tongue sent vibrations up and down his body, palms trickled with anticipation of his hand making contact with hers.

They went down and joined the rest of their squad on the floor. Everybody was having a good time; laughing, drinking and dancing, including Chassidy and Kendrick, which was a complete shock considered how she dodge him like a game of middle school dodgeball during recess.

Julian, slowing down his movements, licked his lips and whispered in Jade's ear, "Baby girl, you smoke?"

"Depends—If you got green, I do?"

Julian looked at Jade from her shoes to her hair, willing and ready to devour her right in that moment, whispered in her ear again, "Come on. You wanna get out of here?"

"I'm down."

Everybody was so enveloped in their own situations that nobody noticed Julian and Jade faded to the back and departed the club.

#  Scene 8

Julian and Jade left Club 10AK and hopped in the limo to head back toward the hotel. Julian went deep into his pocket and pulled out a blunt, rubbed it a bit to straighten it out and then lit it up like the Fourth of July. He took the first pull and passed it over to Jade.

"I know I told you this already but you looking real good tonight, baby girl. "

"Thank you daddy. You ain't do too bad yourself."

Jade took a hit then another hit and gave it back to Julian. Puff. Puff. Puff. Pass. They continued their moment of Mary Jane euphoria, passing and puffing Julian decides to put it out.

"Why you sittin' so far over there. Come closer to me baby girl."

Jade moved closer to Julian in the big black dick even though deep down in her lower region she was in the mood to ride the real thing. As soon as she got next to him, he kissed her.

"That ain't too forward is it?"

"Nah, you good. You got some soft ass lips tho. Kiss me again."

Julian and Jade swapped kisses for a few seconds, even though it felt like a lifetime had passed by. The sweetness of his lips having long conversations with her lips. They made it back to the hotel, but were still sitting inside the limo. Julian looks up and realizes they had arrived back.

"Jade, looks like we made it back to the hotel."

Tracing the outside of her lips with her tongue. "Damn, already?"

"Yeah. Listen, you wanna come up to my room for a little bit and chill?"

"I'm down. Let's do it."

Julian opened the door to the limo and got out. Reaching in and seizing Jade by her hand to help her out.

"You tall as hell with them heels on, ma. I like that shit tho."

Jade's beautifully structured teeth peered through her heart shaped lips at Julian and nodded to him as a thank you gesture. They went inside, got on the elevator and went straight to Julian's room. Julian unlocks the door and they walked in, the door closing silently behind them.

"Welcome to casa de la Gates." Julian says with a chuckle.

"This room looks just like mine, man," Jade says sarcastically. They both laughs as Jade takes a seat on the edge of the bed.

"You can take them high as heels off now. I know ya feet hurtin'."

"You ain't even have to tell me that," One shoe off. The other following behind it like a baby sister following her older sibling to the candy store. Her shoes found their home tucked away nicely in a corner of the room.

Julian took his suit jacket off and threw it on a chair. "Aye, you wanna finish blazing this lil bit I got left?"

Jade got up, took the blunt out of his hand and kissed him. Making his manhood rise like fresh baked bread in the oven.

Their kisses go from soft and sweet, competing with another. Over and over. Julian took both hands and ran them down Jade's backside, slapping it softly, teasing her. "You got a fat ass." He looked her in her eyes, a flirty smirk on his face and kissed her deeply.

"Wait, you sure this ain't too forward?"

"Nah. I told you, you good."

They start kissing again. Jade runs her hands down Julian's chest and rested them his belt. She looked him in the eyes, gave him a smirk and unbuckled his belt. Eyes moving up and down his exterior. Jade had played this in her mind a thousand times but she never thought tonight she would get the chance to actually bring it to life.

Jade unzipped Julian's pants, slowly made her way down on her knees and enveloped his manhood in her warm mouth.

"Shit!" Julian says, "That shit feels so fuckin' good, baby girl."

Jade let him slip in and out of her mouth slowly and intensely, while Julian's eyes made several excursions to the back of his head. Julian moaned as Jade sped up. Faster, gripping him. The walls of her mouth opening, relaxing and gripping again. Right before Julian felt his body about to explode, he stopped Jade, pulled her up and kissed her.

"Damn baby girl. Where the hell you learn that shit from?"

Wiping his juices from her lips, "Don't worry about it," Jade says with a smile.

Julian picked Jade up and laid her on the bed. He took his hands and exposed her breasts. He licked her nipples and sucked on her small breasts while admiring the rest of her body. He took his hand and slipped his fingers inside Jade's romper, between her legs. When he realized she had on no underwear, he smiles. Julian inserts his index finger inside of Jade's love and she moans.

"mmm—. Don't tease me daddy."

"I ain't no tease baby girl. Believe that. Just let me do my thing."

In and out of Jade's love his finger moves and curves. Calling to her love to come to him. Her moans gain strength and wind as Julian's manhood grows longer and harder. Right before Jade slips into the world of orgasmic heaven, Julian stops.

"What's wrong?" Jade says

"Nothing baby girl. I want you—all of you. Let me undress you."

Julian undresses Jade. Romper landed here. Shirt and bra over there. He marvels at her body. "Damn girl. You been hiding all of that under there?"

Jade helps Julian out of his shirt and his pants and boxers. Julian spreads Jade's long legs, exposing her welcoming center and looks at her like a man ready to devour his last meal. "You sure you want this?"

"Ask me again and imma say no." Jade says with a smirk.

"You got a slick ass mouth, you know that." Julian reached over and grabbed a gold pack from the table next to the bed. Condom secured. Julian gave Jade all of him at one time. She gasped.

"You aight?"

"Yeah, I'm good. Don't stop okay."

Julian pushed in and out of Jade's love. In and out. Key and locks. Her wetness raining down over him. Her legs shaking, earth quaking with ever thrust. His body slowly going into convulsions.

Jade screams, "Daddy, don't stop!"

"Damn baby. This shit feels so good. I'm about to come." Right before he reached that wonderful climax-filled place, Jade propositions Julian.

"Lay down, daddy. Let me take you for a ride."

Jade slides down on Julian's manhood slowly. Up and down. Up and down. Resting her hands on his chest. Moving faster, more intense. They both hold on tight for the ride. His hands on her waist. Eyes locked on her lips. Breasts bouncing to the heavens.

"Shit! Jade, I'm—fuck—girl—comin— "

"Me too daddy—mmm" Her sweet storm came crashing down on Julian and she quickly rested her head on his chest. "That shit was everything I thought it would be and more." Jade says to herself. Julian turned over, laying her next to him and grabbed the blunt that they didn't finish. He lit up and took a pull. "You wanna hit this?"

"Shit yeah"

Smoke making a cloud around the bed. "I ain't never met a girl like you, baby girl. You special and you cool as fuck too."

"You ain't so bad yourself, Mr. Gates." They both laughed, finish the half consumed blunt and pass out for a few hours. Throughout the night, Julian and Jade go at it again and again; leaving nothing but their sweat and memories on the sheets.

#  Scene 9

Everybody made their way back to the VIP area, except for Chauncey and Sasha. They were so consumed in the aura of the night, they stayed on the dance floor. Time was standing still for them. Shawn snuggled up close to Mariah.

"You smell so good, girl. What you got on?"

"I got you on."

"Nah, you smell way better than I do right about now." They both laugh

Shawn kisses on Mariah's neck. She nudged him in his stomach with her elbow.

"You want me to stop?" Shawn says

"What you tryna do to me in here with all these people around?"

Shawn traced the outline of his facial hair, "What I'm tryna do is get to know you better. Don't pay these fools no mind. They damn sure ain't paying us no attention. Look at em'."

Mariah took a look around and noticed everyone was kind of doing their own thing. Then she noticed that Jade and Julian were gone.

"That heffa left. I mean, without no heads up or nothing."

"Who, ya girl Jade and Julian? Yeah, I noticed that too. We ain't gotta guess what the hell happen with them two." They laugh again. Shawn kisses Mariah again on her neck. In his mind, this was his chance to leave the club with Mariah. He looks up to see if he can find Chauncey to let him know he was leaving.

"My boy looks like he's really feeling your girl down there."

Mariah looks down at Chauncey and Sasha on the dance floor. Her arms around him. His arms around her. Both in a trance. "Yeah. I ain't seen her like that in a long time. She don't get out much."

"You ready to leave?"

"Yeah, we can leave."

Shawn and Mariah left the club and went back to the hotel. "You aight? You seem a bit nervous." Shawn says to Mariah

"I'm not nervous. I just—.I didn't think that we would be here together like this."

Shawn flashes a smile at Mariah. They arrive back to the hotel. He got out of the limo and helped her out too. "Let me get those for you." Shawn grabbed Mariah's purse and shoes so she could walk in the hotel. They entered the hotel and got on the elevator. While inside the elevator, Shawn kisses Mariah again but this time, his lips lock with hers.

"What was that for?" Mariah says

"Nothing. I just think you're gorgeous. I hope I made your night worthwhile."

"You can make it even better if you kiss me aga—" The elevator doors open to the 15 floor.

"How about you come to my room with me and I'll give you all the kisses you want?"

Mariah smiles and complies with Shawn. Off they went to his room. Shawn opens the door and allows her to walk in first. His eyes glued to her fluid-like movements as she walked in. He was so engulfed in her that he forgot to close the door.

"You left your door open."

"Oh shit, my bad." Shawn closes the door, walks back toward Mariah and kisses her again. Eyes imprisoned in hers, he says, "I think you're the most beautiful woman I've met in a long time."

"Cut the bullshit, Shawn. I know you have a lot of women throwing themselves at you all damn day."

"All of that shit is true, but I'm here with you now. They throwing but I ain't catching none of that shit. It's something different about you. I can't put my finger on it but I like it." He kisses her again but this time his lips stayed a little longer. He took his hands and ran them down her sides down to her hips, gripping her thighs. He picked her up and laid her on the bed.

"Do you mind if I show you something?"

"Show me what?"

"Just say yes."

"Yeah, Shawn. Show me what you talking about."

Shawn pushes Mariah's dress up, spreads her legs and kisses her thighs. His tongue traveling her yellow-bricked road. Gathering momentum inside his pants. Almost to the wizard of her honey-filled land.

"Mmm———" she moans. Her honey drizzles inside his mouth. He took it slow with her to make sure that she was enjoying every moment of his gifts. Shawn looks up at Mariah as she grips the pillows, one in each palm. "I hope you liked it." Mariah pulls Shawn up to her and kisses him. They undress each other quickly and Shawn covers himself in latex goodness. He takes her legs places them on his shoulders and enters her wet center.

"Fuck!" Shawn says

"Oh—Shawn—Wait—No—Okay—You got it."

Shawn thrusts in and out of her center delivering steady strokes, painting her center with his strong, fleshy brush. "Baby, turn over." He places her on her stomach and enters her honey-suckled love from behind. Mariah grabbed the pillows and screamed.

"Shhhhh baby"— Shawn says as he thrusts deeper inside of her.

"Shawn, baby what— are you doing— to me?" Mariah realized that this was more than sex. It felt like the early stages of love making.

"I just wanna give you all of me right now baby." He says with each thrust, "Let me do this."

Shawn and Mariah moan intensely as Shawn gave all of himself to her. "I'm about to meet you, knock on your door, baby. I wanna see your face when I do." Shawn turns Mariah over on her back, lifts her legs in the air, and digs deep into her love like a shovel looking for gold in the depths of the earth. Mariah gasped. Shawn looked into her eyes as they climax together. Bodies wet. Sheets stained with honey and cream.

"I knew there was something different about you girl. Today was a damn good day." Shawn says. They chuckle. Shawn snuggled up to Mariah from behind and held her while she fell asleep. Peaceful sounds of her light snores mingle with his throughout the night. A lust-filled soundtrack.

#  Scene 10

"Girl, I didn't know you could dance like that."

"Well Mr. Harrison, it's a lot about me you don't know."

"Well, how about I get to know you a little better then miss—"

"Elan, but you can call me E—that's if you want to."

"I like Elan—so I'll call you Elan." They both laugh. "Looks like my boys are all disappearing on me. I guess we should leave too."

"It is getting kind of late, don't you think?"

"Yeah it is. Ain't nobody left in here but Chauncey and your girl down there, Kendrick and miss cutie right here. Aye Kendrick, man we out of here. I'll see you in the morning my boy."

"Aight yall. Enjoy your night," Kendrick says

Alec and Elan left the club and went back to the hotel. They arrived at the hotel then Alec notices that he didn't have his hotel room key. "Damn, I left my key with Julian."

"That's alright. You can come down to my room until we find out where Julian went."

"You're a gracious woman, Elan." Alec says. They went to Elan's room. Elan grabs her key from her purse to open the door. Alec stands close behind her, savoring her scent, kissing her neck, nibbling on the back of her ear. "Um, Mr. Harrison, what are you doing?"

"What you mean, girl? I ain't do nothing," Alec says and smiles. Elan opens her door, they walk in and the door closes behind them. As soon as she turns around, he presses her up against a wall and kisses her.

"Wait, got damn! Hold up—.Alec."

"What, Elan? You said I been playing hard to get. I'm hard now. Let's get it."

Elan browsed his stance as if she were admiring the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Eyes landing on the stiffer part of him. She melts inside her underwear. Bomb activated. "Man, this ain't what you want. You sure you can handle all of this?"

Alec pulls Elan closer. Blending the chocolate of his lips with the caramel in hers. He ensures her with his tongue that what he means is business. "Come follow me." Alec led Elan to the bathroom. Continuing his conversation with her neck. Her shoulders. Back up to her ears. Slithering his hands down her backside he lifts her dress. "Alec. Wait— I hope you have protection."

"Don't worry Elan. I got you." No babies tonight. Suddenly, the Magnum was in place. Before Elan could even cross-examine the situation, Alec had her doubled over on the sink, legs wide enough to receive the gifted width and length of his prize.

"Oh God—" Elan murmurs. With every thrust he grants her, she receives like mail to a p.o. box. He pounds, thrusts again and again. Sensually. Deeper and deeper is what she demands. Pain and pleasure is what he supplies.

"Can you take it?"

"I—I—Oh—I———can take—ii—t" Elan moans. Words stuttering. Breaths short, sweet. Tempting. Exotic.

"I thought you said I couldn't handle this?" Alec thrusts in and out of her love without giving her a chance to respond. She moans and whimpers, "A—l—e—.c"

"Yeah baby,"

"Slow it down for me baby."

Alec slips out of her steamy room of pleasure. Leads Elan to the bedroom. They quickly undress. Alec lean back on the bed. "Show me how to slow it down."

Elan mounts Alec and slowly lowers down on top of him, gasping as she realizes he was more than she thought. She can still handle it. Placing her hands on Alec's chest. Steadying herself. Taking him on a ride out of this world. "Is this what you wanted Alec?" Elan asked.

"Damn, baby—yeah—shit. I'm—I'm——"

"You wha—t"

Her walls came tumbling down around his handle like a waterfall. Humpty Dumpty didn't survive this one either.

Arriving at the door of pleasure together. Sweat dripping from their faces. Hearts beating like the little drummer boy. Alec smiles at Elan. He kisses her breasts and tells her, "I didn't expect that from you."

"I told you this wasn't what you wanted." They both laugh.

"If it's aight with you, can I stay with you tonight?"

"Anything for you, Mr. Harrison."

"You can stop calling me that now. Besides, I like it when you call me, A—l—e—c." Alec says. Laughing about it. Having pillow talk until they fell asleep.

#  Scene 11

Time passes. Lights get dimmer. Music slows down. Eyes get weaker. Conversations turn to compromises. Aliyssa leans in. "I'm so ready to bounce out of this place. Let's take the limo back. My feet are hurting too bad stand and wait on the shuttle." Aliyssa says

"That's cool with me." Malik responds. He knows that by the time the shuttle makes it back around to the club her feet will be in more pain than childbirth. They get into the limo waiting on the side of the club and make their departure.

Malik tells the driver to pull around the back of the hotel and park so they can talk a little bit more. Linger a little longer in the hemisphere of their swelling moment of seduction. The countless backdrops of the night sky display hues of black, blue and purple. Inside the limo laugh and at each silent moment, they stare at one another. Their eyes visit familiar places on each other's faces.

On that herringbone hardwood dance floor all their motives and premediated conclusions were thrown out the window. Worry escaped their minds. Stress wasn't invited. Lies and deceit didn't even bother to RSVP. Nobody was concerned about anything that they left behind. Not even Chassidy. The only things that mattered were the memories being created.

"I noticed you were feeling a brother back there. Dancing and grinding all up on me. I see you."

"You aight. I mean, I've been feeling you the whole night. Besides, I love dancing. I love to be free to move and express myself, if you know what I mean. "

"You know what? You got a slick ass mouth on you girl but I like that about you. It's kinda turning me on."

Her hands lifted, moving in a back that thang all the way up motion, she grinds in the seat of the limo. "Thank you. I get it from my momma." They both laugh. Malik and Aliyssa sat in the limo and talked longer than expected. During their conversation, Malik moves his hand over and touches Aliyssa's hand. He looks at her and says, "You know, I'm really felling you. I think we got something here and I would like to explore it a little more, if that's aight with you."

Aliyssa sits back in the seat, raises her left eyebrow and asks, "What exactly did you have in mind, Malik?"

"Well, I was thinking that maybe we could talk a little bit more. You know. Take this dialogue outside of this limo and allow space and opportunity to have a fair chance. What you think about that?

Malik flashes a smile at Aliyssa, leans in and kisses her forehead. "So you give kisses on the forehead, huh?" Malik smiled and kissed her forehead again, making his way down to her lips and stuck his tongue in her mouth.

"Damn, you're a good kisser." She licks her lips. The alcohol from his tongue mixed with her sweetness created a drunken elixir on the peak of her lips. "I think we may need to slow this down a little bit before one of us have regrets in the morning."

Yeah. I think you're right. Besides, I'm still interested in knowing what makes you tick. Are you still up for more dialogue?" Malik turned the music in the limo down in the back.

She sat next to him in silence. She ponders. Then realizing that he's waiting for a response from her, she whispers, "Yeah." She clears her throat and speaks with strength. "I can talk a little more."

"Whew! I thought you were gonna say no. No way I was gonna let you tell me no. I look too good tonight and you look—you look damn good too, girl! All that goodness ain't going to waste tonight. Let's get out of here and go catch a night cap."

Malik and Aliyssa get out of the limo and go straight to the lounge area of the hotel. They order drinks. A hot chai tea for Aliyssa and vodka for Malik. They babysit their drinks for a few hours talking politics, debating the stock market and arguing about the Giants crushing the Seahawks last Sunday.

Marcus, Kadeem, Nadya and Dominique all left the club together. They took the shuttle back. Once the shuttle arrived back at the hotel, they got out and went inside.

"I really enjoyed your company tonight." Marcus says

"I had a really nice time too, Marcus. You cool peeps." Dominique says. She gives Marcus a hug and they both get on the elevator and go to their rooms for the night.

"Girl, you almost danced me out my shoes tonight." Kadeem says

"You don't say?" Nadya says in a sarcastic tone "I knew you wouldn't be able to keep up with me. I got skills."

"Well, let me walk you and your skills to your room." Kadeem replies sarcastically. They take the next elevator up to the 14th floor. The doors open and they walked out of the elevator and go down to Nadya's suite. "How long are you and your girls here for?"

"Our flights leave early Monday morning then we gotta head back to our homes. Gotta get back to real life."

"Okay, cool. I can understand that. I think we fly out sometime on Monday morning too. Check this out. You tired right now?"

"Not really. I mean, it is late but it's not _too_ late. What's up?"

"Let's go over to the casino—walk around—..see what's poppin'."

"Cool. Let me change into my flats real quick and we can go down there." Nadya goes inside her room, quickly changes into her flat shoes and they go over to the casino.

Nadya and Kadeem stayed at the casino until for a few hours, cracking jokes and walking around like teenagers at a carnival. Seeing that most of the tables and machines were closing down for the night, they decide to head back to the hotel. "That was funny as hell to see all them white people lose all they damn money. I bet they gon' cry in the car." Kadeem says

"You ain't never lied. I'd be damn if I spent all my hard earned dollars in a casino for another nigga's benefit." They both laugh hysterically while walking back to the hotel. "This was really fun. Thank you so much for inviting me to go with you." Nadya says as they get on the elevator to go to their rooms. Nadya noticed that Kadeem was looking at her. "You like what you see?"

"You can't tell by now—.You must be blind, girl. I been staring at you all night long. Checking you out. Watching that thang move back and forth, back and forth. The slot machines ain't got nothing on that right there." He eyes her prize from behind, wondering how much junk is really in her trunk as they get into the elevator.

Nadya stood in the corner of the elevator, bats her eye lashes rapidly and replies lightly, "Well damn! Tell me how you really feel."

Kadeem steps in front of her, blocking her from the doors. Her eyes shifting from his eyes to his lips. The protruding bulge in the pants clouds her mind momentarily, then the elevator doors open and off they go down the hall of the 14th. He bites down on his bottom lip and watches her walk away. He yells. His voice bouncing off the decorated walls. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow then." Standing in the hallway. Hands in his pockets and a smirk resting on his face. "I guess so," Nadya yells back. Never turning back to see his response. She drops her head, glossy smile on her lips. She walks in her room and closes the door.

Still sitting in the club with Sasha, Kendrick and Chassidy, Chauncey glances at his watch. Time is moving faster than a horse at a race track. He looks over at Kendrick and says, "Hey, it's getting late. Yall wanna head back to the hotel?"

"Yeah man. I think it's time we dip out before we get put out. Let's bounce man," Kendrick says

"We can grab the shuttle back. It may be quicker than waiting on the limo." Chassidy says to Sasha

"That sounds like a good idea, Chassidy." Sasha says. They all take the shuttle back to the hotel. "Girl! Thank you so much for agreeing to take the shuttle. I didn't want to ride back alone with him," Chassidy whispered to Sasha.

"Really Chassidy? Don't do him like that. He seems like a really good guy. Feel him out. You might miss out on a good one."

"Shhhh he ain't Dre. That's the only thing I'm missing. He just ain't my type. He too—perfect or something."

Perfect was a pretty close conclusion. Kendrick was a very progressive actor. He dabbled in the modeling business but he didn't have any dirt on his hands. No dirty past times and Chassidy constantly chased after men with questionable backgrounds. He didn't fit her dream model of the type of man she would be with.

When the shuttle pulls up to the hotel and Chassidy hurriedly rushes out and swiftly makes her way inside the hotel and straight into the elevator. "Wait!" Kendrick yells as he jumps out of the shuttle and tries to catch up to Chassidy. He was too late. The elevator doors close right in his face. "Damn man." Hands rubbing over the waves in his hair, he hung his head low and got on the next elevator—heading straight in his room and going to bed confused and disappointed.

Chauncey and Sasha got out of the shuttle and went inside the hotel. While waiting for the elevator to come back down, Sasha and Chauncey make small talk. "Poor Kendrick. He seems to really like Chassidy and she just won't give him the time of day." She shakes her head in amazement at Chassidy's poor consideration for Kendrick's feelings.

"That's kinda sad. He's a really good dude. Great guy if you ask me." He looks at Sasha and asks, "Can I walk you to your room?"

Sasha laughs and replies, "We ARE on the same floor."

He laughs and replies, "Your laugh is so contagious but yeah you're right." They get on the elevator and got off on the 15th floor. Chauncey walks Sasha to her hotel room. Standing in front of her hotel room, he smiles at her. Effortlessly washing her with his words, he tells her, "You looked breathtaking tonight."

"You looked very handsome yourself, Chauncey. I really enjoyed spending time with you tonight."

"No, the pleasure was definitely all mines Sasha."

Wishing he would ask her to come inside, he makes one more statement. "Well, I hope you have good night, Sasha."

"You too Chauncey." Sasha doesn't give in but she delivers an enchanted smile his way and he duplicates it.

Chauncey give Sasha a hug and waits until she goes inside her room and closes her door to walk away. He gets back to his room, showers and lies down in the bed. He reaches for the phone to call Sasha, but he remains hesitant. "I should call her. No that would look desperate. But I wanna hear her voice. No, Chauncey. Man up. Fuck it! I'm calling." After arguing with his conscious, he decides to call Sasha on her hotel room phone.

She answers the phone. Her voice as angelic as it was a few moments ago. "Hello"

"Hey Sasha. It's Chauncey." He goes silent. Contemplating his next few words, he gains a wind of confidence and asks, "If you don't have any plans for dinner tomorrow, I would like to take you out to this restaurant called _The Cut_ around 6:30pm."

"I would love too, Chauncey. I'll let the girls know that we are going to dinner." She whispers, "Sleep tight. See you tomorrow."

Sasha hangs up the phone with Chauncey. He lies back in his bed, hands folded behind his head with a smile of accomplishment on his face. Although he wanted to take her out alone, he settles for everyone attending. He just wanted to be with Sasha.

She showers and drifts off to sleep. Sweet thoughts of their conversation dwelled in the back of her mind while she slept.

#  Scene 12

It's Saturday morning in Las Vegas. The clock on the table reads 8:41a.m. Everyone had a great time last night at club 10AK, including Chassidy—even though she shaded the hell out of Kendrick. It was time for everyone to get up, get breakfast and go about their day. The plan for their night was dinner at one of the best restaurants in Vegas— _The Cut_ : Great scenery, exquisite music and a tasteful menu. Sounds like a club, doesn't it?

"Good morning, beautiful," says Alec.

"Morning sexy," Elan replied gazing into his big brown eyes. Elan looks over at her phone to check the time. "Wow! We almost slept right through breakfast."

"I don't mind skipping breakfast. I got enough to eat right here," his eyes traveling across Elan's body.

"You trying to test me again, I see."

"I don't test nobody," Alec says laughing. He got up and got dressed. "I need to go get my key from Julian so I can take a shower and meet everybody at breakfast."

Elan sat up in the bed, brushed her hair back, sheets draped across her body, "Aww, you leaving so soon?"

Alec turns to Elan and says, "Tonight girl— You and me." He leans in and plants a kiss on her lips.

"I'm gonna hold you to that, Alec."

Alec left Elan's room and walked down to Julian's room.

Mariah wakes up and decides to wake Shawn up too. She kisses his lips and slips all the way under the covers. His manhood was already standing at attention. She took him into her warm mouth and he moans. "mmm, girl!"

Mariah looks up at Shawn, sliding his manhood out of her mouth like a Popsicle and says, "Good morning Shawn" and then she goes back to business. Shawn's moans mixed with grunts are so intense that it excites her. She moves faster. The walls of her mouth locking around him as he reaches his climax. His juices filled her mouth and she loved it.

Out of breath, he tells her, "Girl, you gone make me fall in love with you."

"Is that right?" Mariah says

Alec arrives at Jason's door and knocks, "Yo! J! Man you in there?"

The door opens and there stands Jade. Fully clothed in her yesterday's threads. "Yeah, he's in here."

"Whoa!" Alec looks at Jade. His eyes rush over to Julian. Julian flashes a smile of achievement.

"I just came to get my key." Alec says with a Joker-like smirk on his face.

"Nah bro, you good." Julian says. He grabs Jade's hand. Pulls her in close to him and smiles at her." Baby girl, we gotta do this again."

Jade looks at Julian in a mischievous way and says, "no doubt." She leaves his room and goes to her room to prepare for breakfast.

Julian hands Alec his key as the door closes when Jade leaves. "Yo!"

"Yeah man. You already know." Julian says laughing.

"Aye, man. Do ya thing bro. Look, I'm gonna go shower real quick and grab some breakfast. I'll catch up with yall downstairs, aight?"

"That's what's up."

Alec leaves Julian's room and goes down to his own. As soon as he sticks his key in the door, Mariah steps outside of Shawn's room. Alec looks, smiles and went on in his room.

"Mariah. Wait a sec." Shawn says, "You left something."

"What did I leave?"

Shawn walks to the door and kisses her. "Thank you for uh— waking me up this morning," he says with a cunning smile.

"It was my pleasure."

Shawn watches Mariah walk down to her room and inside she goes. He says to himself, "Damn. Where has she been all my life?"

Everybody made it back to their rooms, showered and went to grab breakfast inside the hotel. Sitting at the tables, ready for their orders to come back, the girl engage in a little conversation.

"I see someone had a good time." Mariah says to Sasha

"Yeah Sasha. I saw how Chauncey was wrapped up in you. It seemed like it would take Jaws of Life to pry the space open between you two on the dance floor." Aliyssa says

"I had a really good time last night." She blushes. "I hadn't felt like that in years." Sasha says. She got lost in Chauncey's charm last night and he did the same.

Everyone was eating, laughing and telling each other about their nightly escapades. Jade notices that Chassidy was barely eating her food, staring off into space and looked like she'd lost her best friend. "Chassidy, what's wrong with you sis?"

"I feel bad yall."

"She should. She practically handed Kendrick her ass to kiss. She left that man hanging at the elevator looking like a sick puppy," Sasha says with a chuckle.

"Why'd you do that Chassidy?" Elan asked.

"Man, I don't know. All I know is I didn't sleep well last night. It's eating me up yall."

"Well, do something about then, Chassidy. Grown women handle their business. You know what I mean?" Mariah says

"I told her she's gonna miss out on something good. Keep playing around." Nadya says

"I'm gonna make it right yall. I promise." Chassidy says

"You better or imma beat yo ass for making that boy's weekend hell on earth." Sasha says laughing. "By the way, Chauncey said they want to take us to dinner tonight—some place called _The Cut_.

"Cool." Jade says. "Dinner it is."

They all finished there breakfast and go back to their rooms.

"Ya boy had a nice time last night," Shawn says smiling and stuffing his mouth with waffles. The men decided to enjoy breakfast amongst themselves since the ladies had already developed a little cult-like table together.

"Alec says smiling, "I bet you did. This nigga smiling brighter than the lady on the Colgate commercial right now. Look at him." He grabs a piece of bacon and munches down on it.

With a half-frown half-smirk on his face, Shawn says, "Nigga, don't worry about me. Chauncey was caught up in some warp zone type shit on the dance floor with the pretty lady."

"I hope you got some last night, Chauncey. All that catering to ol' girl better had resulted in some panties dropping." Julian says

"Nah man— it ain't even like that. I see something different about this girl." Chauncey says, sipping his orange juice.

"What's wrong Kendrick, man?" Marcus says

"Ol' girl left his ass at the elevator, begging and shit. Thought I was gon' have to call the ambulance for him. She broke him down." Chauncey says

"See what you need to do is show her how much you want her," Julian says

Shawn blurts out, "Shut up, J— with yo simple ass." Everybody laughs. "Aye, Kendrick. Listen, tell the girl how you feel and if she ain't with it, then don't force it, my nigga. It's other women out there that are dying to get with you anyways."

"Yeah, you right but I'm— never mind. I'll take your advice, Shawn." Kendrick replies.

The guys finish their breakfast. Some go back to their rooms; some go to the lounge area and relax a bit.

#  Scene 13

Everybody went about their day, visiting shops, picking up items to take back home to their family and friends—A few gifts for their guilty pleasures. The girls hit up a few jewel and clothing stores. The guys caught a game or two at the bar; nothing too major as they wanted to remain out of the public eye as much as they could. Later on that night, they got dressed and went to dine for dinner at The Cut restaurant inside the hotel.

Everyone arrived to the restaurant on time. Chauncey informs the hostess that they have a reservation. She checks the list for the reservation and quickly seats them in the reserved private area. The maître d personally came over and took their drink orders. Of course Jade had her Tequila with no ice. Mariah and a few of the other girls ordered some fruity alcoholic drinks. Sasha opted for water as usual. The guys ordered a few Brandy's—some Vodka's. While waiting for their drinks to arrive, Marcus and Dominique were having an intense conversation to themselves.

"So you know I enjoyed you last night. I was kinda hoping we could hang out again later tonight."

"I really enjoyed spending time with you too, Marcus. Of course, I'd love to." Dominique replied. She slipped her hand under the table and touched Marcus on his knee.

Marcus looks at Dominique and smiled. "I wonder how long it's going to be before they bring our drinks." Dominique says—slowly moving her hand up Marcus's thigh. Marcus looked at Dominique shocked, surprised—A look of gratitude across his face. He places one hand over her free hand and whispers "Don't play like that, girl. It's too many people in here."

She backs down, arranges her composure and they finish their conversation as their drinks arrive back to the table. The maître d sends a waitress over to take their food orders and they continue talking, a few laughs given as they wait for their food.

"Yo, Julian! Aye, you remember that night Chauncey rolled up in that little ass electric car?" Shawn asks

"Hell yeah, I remember that. I'm still tryna figure out how in the hell he got in there—He like six feet tall." Julian replied. The whole table erupts in laughter.

"Aye man, don't worry about how I got in there. Just be glad we didn't have to spend that much on gas that night. It was bananas."

The food arrives and it immediately becomes silent. No more verbal conversations—Just chewing, slurping and body language.

As they finished their dinner, Chassidy looks over at Kendrick and he catches her eye. She quickly looks away. Kendrick felt like she had something she wants to say but didn't know if he should respond out of fear of getting his feelings hurt again. He remembered what Shawn told him and instantly, he was internally calm.

The night was still young, so some of the crew went to chill out at the bar; a few went over to the casino. Chassidy reluctantly walks over to Kendrick and asks, "Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"

Kendrick responds, "Why? You wanna hurt my pride even more?"

Chassidy turned to walk away but he grabs her hand. He realizes that he responded to quickly and didn't' give her an opportunity to explain herself. "Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't do that right. Yeah, we can talk."

"Can we go somewhere alone? I just really need to get something off my chest." Chassidy asked

"Sure. Any place in particular that you wanna go to?"

"If it's okay with you, can we go to your hotel room? There's nobody there to distract us."

"Sure—I'm cool with that."

Kendrick and Chassidy leave the rest of the group and head back upstairs to talk.

#  Scene 14

As they stood at the elevator waiting on it to open, Chassidy fidgets with her hands. Kendrick saw that she was nervous but he wasn't sure why. What is his facial expression? His posture? He even turns to the side and checks his breath to make sure it was alright. The elevator opens and they both get on. Kendrick selects the 14th floor button. Chassidy looks over and realizes that that's the same floor she was on. Chassidy in one corner of the elevator with an uneasy look on her face—Kendrick distant in the other corner. The elevator finally made its arrival to the 14th floor and the doors flew open.

"After you," He motions

Kendrick watches her walk out of the elevator and he walks out behind her. In his mind, Chassidy is about to tear into him like she has been doing all weekend long. He shakes that thought out of his head and they walk down to his room. He slips the key in and opens the door. They go inside. Chassidy takes her seat in the white tufted chair by the large window. Kendrick stood by the window and looked out into the night.

"You wanted to talk to me. We here. Tell me what's on your mind."

Chassidy starts rambling to herself. Her head lowered to the ground. Eyes shifting back and forth from corner to corner of the room. She gains a little courage and her voice become clearer. "I wanted to apologize to you for the way I've treated you this weekend. You didn't deserve it and I—.I'm sorry. It's just that—.that—"

His eyes travel from the window to her then back to the window. "It's what, Chassidy? Whatever it is, you can tell me. I told you, I just wanted to get to know you. I'm not trying to hurt you. It's not even like that."

Kendrick looks at her again but she's still staring at the floor. "Chassidy— listen." He walks over to her and lifts her head. He notices a tear cascading from her right eye down her face. His countenance changes. "Whatever it is, just tell me."

Chassidy wipes her face with her left hand and utters, "The thing is—um—well, I've never been with a guy."

Kendrick looks confused. Did she really mean what she just said? He asks, "What do you mean? Are you saying that you're a vir—?

She interrupts his sentence. "Yes—I am. I figured if I put up this mean tough girl attitude, guys wouldn't try to get close to me like that. But you were different. You were persistent and genuine—and it scared me."

"Chassidy, there's nothing wrong with being a virgin and any man that doesn't show you that they want you for more than that, you don't need them. Look at me." More tears pour down her face. Kendrick wipes the new tears from her face and kisses her.

Chassidy looks at him and says, "Don't—"

"I told you, I'll never hurt you and I'll never do anything to offend you. I can stop if you want. It's up to you." He responds. She shook her head from side to side. Her response was no. He lifts her up from the chair, and their lips meet again. "I know we just met a couple of days ago, but I really like you Chassidy. I hope that you will give the opportunity to get to know you. All of you."

"I would love that, Kendrick." Chassidy reaches out to unbutton his shirt but he stops her. "You sure this is what you want Chassidy? Don't do this if you don't want to. I'm not forcing you to do anything, you understand?"

She licks her lips and kisses him again. Her eyes now locked on the prize that lies beneath his core. She attempts to unbutton his shirt again and he stops her— again.

"Let me do this for you. Let me accommodate you tonight, please?"

Kendrick unbuttons his shirt and introduces it to the floor. He removes Chassidy's shirt and softly caresses her back leaving wet, lingering kisses on her lips. She wasn't sure if she deserved it and she stops abruptly. "What's wrong?" Kendrick asks.

"I've treated—"

"Shhhh—I forgive you. Look at me. You good, aight?" Kendrick replied. He kisses her passionately and removes her bra. It meets the floor too. Kendrick leaves a heated trail of kisses stemming from her neck to her shoulders and to her breasts. He held one of her breasts in one hand and caressed it while savoring the other one in his mouth. He flicks her nipple with his tongue and she moans like a virgin peasant girl. His kisses take flight all the way down to her pants. In one motion, he removes her pants and underwear.

He stands back, savors the taste of her on his lips. Kendrick walks over to his bag, school boy smile on his face, and pulls out a condom, walks back over to Chassidy and lays her down on the bed. She's nervous. She doesn't know what to expect from this experience. No book, conversation with friends or class could teach her exactly what to do in this moment.

Kendrick climbs into the bed with her. He hovers over her. "Do you trust me with your body tonight?"

"Yes. I trust you." Her honey pot drips with every yes she gives him.

Moving slowly from her lips to her stomach— His kisses heating up her body like a Miami summer. Kendrick asks her, "Do you trust me with your mind tonight?"

"Yes, Kendrick. I trust you."

As he moves closer to her honey pot, he asks another question, "Do you trust me with your heart tonight?"

"Yes—I trust you."

Kendrick looks up at Chassidy, spreads her legs and tastes the honey that drips for his pleasure. She moans as he continues to taste her. He puts on the condom, looks up at Chassidy and says, "I promise I won't hurt you." He moves up to kiss her, looks at her. She closes her eyes tight then he whispers, "Look at me. I'm right here." and slowly glides inside of her pot of pure honey. She gasps.

"Did I hurt you?" He asks

"No—mmm" She moans, "You're okay. Keep going."

He glides in again. This once vacant spot, now has a tenant and he's stroking slowly at her door— taking his time with her. Guiding and engaging her during their ride to ecstasy.

Kendrick whispers to her, "I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable."

"No. I'm sorry for treating you—ahhh—mmm."

He strokes her honey pot deeper, looking to get to the center it. Ready to make it overflow. He whispers to her again, "You're so beautiful to me—you believe that, baby?

Chassidy screams, "Yesss"

"Ahhh—.mmm." His hips grind against the inside of her, making her thighs shake and tremble like an earthquake. "Chassidy,"—he calls out to her.

"Yes Kendrick," She replies, filled with pure intoxication.

"Am I doing it the way you imagined it?"

"Yes—mmm—It feels so good."

Kendrick kisses Chassidy and thrusts deeper, grinding harder. Her moans compete with his moans. Her screams overshadow the melody created by their bodies. Kendrick delivered Chassidy at the door of orgasmic euphoria, wrapped in a honey dripped bow. He came thunderously soon after. He drops his head, attempting to catch his breath—browsing her face. She saw the sincerity in his eyes and felt his heart concerning her. He laid his head on her stomach. Hearing her sniffling, he glances to see what was wrong now. They'd just had one the greatest experiences of their lives. She was now a woman—a woman with a face full of tears.

Chassidy wipes away the tears from her eyes and says, "I'm so sor—"

"Baby, I told you. There's nothing for you to be sorry about. It's cool. I wanted you and now you're mine." Kendrick assures her that he's going nowhere and that he's not here to take advantage of her. They spend the rest of the night talking about their fears, wants, and desires—until they drift off to sleep. Their bodies drained of carnal pleasure but their minds and souls filled with the newness of each other.

#  Scene 15

It's getting late. The time has been far spent and no change was left over. They all decide that to call it a night. "Has anybody seen Chassidy?" Mariah says

"Nah, not since we left the restaurant." Marcus says as he smiles at Dominique

"Hey, Elan—you see where Chassidy went?"

"Last time I saw her, she was talking to Kendrick." Elan says

"I hope she made things right with him." Mariah says to Elan

"Me too." Elan says

Shawn gets up, stretches and places his arm around Mariah. "Well— it's time for us to bid yall good night." Mariah gives Shawn a smirk. They leave the bar—Shawn's arm wrapped around Mariah's neck— heading upstairs.

"This nigga bidding folk good night—She must have gave it to him good last night." Julian says

"He done changed his whole language and shit. Poof! A whole new vocabulary," Kadeem says laughing

"You mean, like I did you last night?" Jade says

Julian turns to Jade and says, "Why you gotta be petty? You know I won that round." He chuckles.

"Is that so?" Jade says sarcastically looking over at Julian

"Straight like that, ma. Ya know." Julian says

Jade whispers in Julian's ear, "Double or nothing, muthafucka"

"Aye, yo—imma see yall later," Julian says to the crowd. He and Jade leave the bar as well—making their way back upstairs.

Alec and Elan are sitting in the lounge area of the bar; chopping it up. Elan leans over to Alec and asks, "Hey, I brought this game with me that the girls and I were gonna play but since they all doing disappearing acts, how about you and I play it?"

"What kind of game is it, Elan?"

Elan looks Alec in the eyes with a conniving smile and replies, "Twister—but let's make it fun."

"Twister huh?" Alec says—His hands stroking his beard. "Yeah, I can play."

Alec and Elan get up and leave the lounge area as Chauncey and Sasha are seemingly watching them walk away but engrossed in their own conversation.

"Yeah, so right now, I just wanna keep my head in the game, you know." Chauncey says

"I understand what you mean. The fame yall were thrown into came with no "how to" manual." Sasha replies

"Exactly— Exactly! I don't think people really get that. That's why I try to keep my head clear, make sure my intentions are pure and stay humble. Besides, my family keeps me grounded too."

"That's it right there. Humility is an essential characteristic—for any person. The fact that you know what to do and how to handle yourself—that's gonna get you further in life than anything else—and family will definitely pop that hot air balloon and bring you back down to reality if you get too far out there."

They carry on their conversation as everyone else makes their departure.

Meanwhile at the casino, Nadya and Kadeem are still enjoying watching the people lose all of their money. Kadeem leans over to Nadya— "You ready to leave yet?"

Nadya looks at her phone, notices the time and responds, "Yeah. It is getting kind of late. You wanna head back upstairs?"

"Yeah, let's do that." Kadeem and Nadya leave the casino and go back upstairs to his room. Malik, Marcus, Dominique and Aliyssa leave the casino shortly after them.

Chauncey and Sasha are the only ones left downstairs, still enveloped in a meaningfully, deep conversation.

"So, have you talked to any of your family since you been in Vegas this weekend?" Chauncey asks

"Nope. I haven't talked to anyone really. I just needed this time alone to breathe and gather my thoughts—relax a little bit."

"I feel you on that." Chauncey replies. He moves a little closer to her and grabs her hand, placing it in his. "I just wanna tell you that you've been a fresh breeze for me this weekend and it really means a lot to me."

"I feel the same way, Chauncey. Being so bogged down with normal day to day activities, I sometimes find it hard to breathe—to find myself. This weekend has allowed me to find myself again—and you." she replies. A shy smile covers her face.

"That's exactly how I feel too." Chauncey responds. The look in his eyes longs for a deeper connection to her but he keeps his composure. "You know, people ask me all the time why I'm not dating. My answer is simple. I'm not looking to be taken advantage of by anyone. I just wanna give myself to someone who can build me back up after this celebrity life tears me down every day, you know?"

"I completely understand your point. Some people can be all about themselves when it comes to being in a relationship—especially with a celebrity. To me, that's selfish. The whole point of being in a relationship is the RELATE part. It's a selfless act. At least that's the way I see it."

"You GET me." He exhales. Chauncey looks at his watch and notices the time. "It's getting late and we only have one more day left here. I don't wanna keep you up all night. You need your rest."

"Look at you—being all considerate." Sasha replies.

They leave the bar lounge area, get on the elevator and go back upstairs. Chauncey walks Sasha to her room, gives her a hug and they say their goodbye's for the night.

As Chauncey walks towards his room, he overhears a bunch of fumbling, strange noises and a lot of laughing coming from Alec's room. He shakes his head and says to himself, "I don't even wanna know." He walks in his room and closes the door.

Alec and Elan are in a heated game of strip Twister. She still has her bra and panties on. Her right leg is on yellow, left leg on red, right arm behind her on red and her left arm on green. Left with nothing but his boxers and socks on, Alec considers his close defeat. His right leg on red, left leg on yellow, his left arm on yellow and his right arm on red—towering over Elan's whole body. He looks at her and says, "don't make me buckle, girl."

Alec spins the needle, "Alright Elan, your right leg should be on green." Elan moves her right leg to green—and it places her right between Alec's legs. She looks up, smiles and exposes the chocolate bar inside his boxers.

"Aye..girl! What you doing?"

Elan gives him no time ask more questions. Hungry to please him, she swallows his manhood. "Damn—" Alec says. Elan continues her venture—Sucking, licking, tasting his marshmallow goodness—Mingling it in her saturated mouth. She makes him weak at the knees. Alec stops her right before he falls. He gets up, moves her panties to the side and tastes her love—Putting pressure on her labia until she explodes in a range of moans, screams and exotic rage. "mmm—oh—ah—ah—ah—ah—" He quickly finds a condom, slips it on and dives into her so deep, she screams louder.

He strokes her deeper—in and out—His hips moving in a circular motion. Then he stops, catches his breath. He smiles and thrusts right back into her—.making her scream louder. Game over.

"So what was that shit you was talking down at the bar?" Julian says. He undresses Jade with urgency—Placing hard kisses on her lips, her neck. Her face— His manhood hard as calculus, swelling in his pants— Throbbing, waiting and panting for her wet center.

"Nigga you the one called me petty for speak truth," Jade says being a smart ass. She rips his clothes off—Shirts, pants, bra, boxers all in up in the air. Being tossed like it's caught up in the eye of a hurricane.

"Let me show you how petty I can be." Julian grabs a condom, slips it on and gives Jade no time to make a comeback response.

Jade screams. "Damn daddy—."

"This feel petty to you?" Julian says as he thrusts in and out of Jade's love. Flowing with ocean like waters. He places his left hand around Jade's throat putting pressure on it.

"Hell yea, daddy. That's what I'm talking bou—t—ahh—umm—.I like that kinky shit but you giving me too much—to quick. Slow it down for me, baby."

"Nah, don't back down, now. Take this dick. It's petty tho, right."

Jade spreads her legs wider to receive Julian as he goes deeper. His thrusts, his grinds, render Jade powerless. He looks down between her legs and views liquid goodness covering him. "That shit is beautiful, baby girl." She shakes. He grunts loud reaching a climax more beautiful than the Mona Lisa. Julian rolls over, picks up a blunt, light it and takes a hit. Blowing the smoke in the air, he smiles and says, "You think I'm petty now?"

Jade, out of breathe and satisfied, smiles back and replies, "fuck you nigga!"

"Shitttt—I just did." They both erupt in laugher and finish smoking.

Mariah is laying in the bed with Shawn—Her head resting on his chest. She looks up at him and says, "I like this. I don't know why but I feel safe with you."

Shawn looks down at Mariah, smiles and replies, "Baby, you got me falling for you faster than a snow storm in New York during the winter."

She smiles back at him. "Well—"

"Well—" Shawn replies back. Mariah moves up and kisses him—His tongue mingling with her tongue. They kiss until she gets weak, wet and thirsty for a drink from his cup of ecstasy. Their clothes disappear in their heated moment of passion. He licks and kisses her breasts savoring them one by one. Mariah places her hand over one of his, caressing herself and asks, "You love licking and teasing these, huh?"

"Of course—I love everything about you. Besides, I wanna lick my lips and still taste you in the morning."

Shawn looks down and notices that he's standing at attention and is ready to serve. He reaches over and grabs a condom from the nightstand drawer. He slips on the condom and Mariah decides to mount him.

"Mariah, baby—." He moans

"Yes Shawn," she responds—Her hips grinding against his—Gripping his manhood tightly with her love. His movements restricted. His hands roaming from her breasts to her stomach to her back. Landing on her ass. He grips her cheeks. Pushes himself deeper inside her center.

"I—think—baby, I think—."

"Don't— say it if you don't mean it, Shawn."

"I mean it Mariah—please—just—listen to me—mmm."

Mariah and Shawn moan in competition. Her ass bouncing vigorously against his inner thighs. He pushes deeper and deeper until they both climax. Sweat dripping from her forehead onto his face. "I really meant—."

"I know, Shawn. Just don't say it. Not yet." She replies. They lay under the covers, pillow talking until the wee hours of the morning.

#  Scene 16

The Next Day

Everyone wakes up—Brains non-misty about the night before. Going about their normal vacation routine of getting ready for breakfast. We all go downstairs, sit down and order our food. Not too long after the orders are placed, our food arrives. Waffles, fresh fruit, orange juice. While everyone is engaging in several different conversations, Kendrick and Chassidy walk in, hand in hand, smiling and laughing. The entire table gets up and gives them a standing ovation. Chassidy blushes and drops her head as Kendrick plants a kiss on her cheek.

They sit down and join us at the breakfast table.

"Oh my God, Chassidy! Girl you are glowing!" Mariah says. We all shake our heads in agreement. Not only did she apologize to Kendrick for acting like disgruntled employee, he became her first and now their bond would be forever unbreakable.

Shawn gets up and gives Kendrick a high five. "My boy! I knew you had it in you." He says, giving off his proud father-like smile.

After we finished our breakfast, the girls and I get up to go about our day. Right before I turn to leave the table, Chauncey grabbed my hand, eyes mirroring a puppy dog missing his master. "Hey Sasha, do you have any plans tonight?"

"Nah. Not really."

"Cool. Listen. Can you come to my room around 8? I have something that I would like to show you."

"Sure. 8. I'll see you then."

I gave him a smile and then I rushed to catch up with the girls. But in the back of my cerebral cortex, I'm wondering what he has in store for me. To do more shopping and then some site seeing with the fellas. Later that evening, everyone returns back to the hotel. The girls have paired up and left with their guy. I went back to my room to start packing and getting my things in order for our departure tomorrow. I got to my room, walked in and I notice that there is a box sitting on my bed with a note attached. My eyes searched the room trying to figure out how this got here. Unsuccessful, I pick up the box. The note reads, "For you to wear—See you tonight at 8." I smile, put the note down and open the black box wrapped in black organza ribbon. Inside the box is was long, black form fitted dress with a detachable peplum. I look back down and there was also a brand new pair of Louboutin heels with matching jewelry.

"What in the hell?" I said to myself. I put the items back in the box, lid half way on and finish my packing. Thoughts flowing through my mind. "What does he have to show me that involves me dressing like I'm going to the Oscars?"

Everything has been packed. I've taken my nap. My body is rested. I've showered, cleansing every inch of myself. It's 7:50p.m. I'm putting the finishing touches on my makeup. One last glance in the mirror. I smile, making sure Ruby Woo has completely covered my lips and apply my mascara. I take in a deep breath, check to make sure my jewelry is straight and head toward the door. I grab the door handle, open it and there is Chauncey—.standing at the door in a black suit, white shirt and black bow tie. Two dozen long stem yellow roses protruding from his right hand. "Oh—wow! Yellow is my favorite color. How did you know?"

"I got my ways of finding out about things that matter to me." He says to me. His bright white smile peering back at me. I took the roses and put them on the table facing the window in my hotel room and close the door. We walk down the hall towards the elevator instead of his hotel room and I say to him, "I thought we were going to your room."

"We are—just not right now. I wanna take you to dinner first. Is that okay?

"As long as I'm with you, nothing else matters."

Chauncey and I get on the elevator and go down stairs. I'm nervous. The elevator opens and he motions for me to precede him. I do. He follows right behind me. Watching my body move like ocean waves in the dress he gifted to me. The walk outside of the hotel is swift. Chauncey walks up to the limo and opens the door for me. It's filled with more yellow roses. "Really Chauncey?!" This time he really made my chocolate covered complexion blush. My mind immediately goes into overtime trying to figure out his plan.

He smiles back at me and I get in the limo, with his help. He closes the door, goes around the other side and gets in. He leans up and addresses the driver to go ahead—and we ride. We ride through Vegas, bright lights outside our dark tented windows. Ten minutes later, the limo stops and my heart races. Chauncey gets out and goes to the other door to let me out. As I step outside the limo, I look up and see this huge sign, _"The Eiffel Tower Restaurant"_. Right away I knew. I knew this dinner was more than dinner. He must have something great to give me after this dinner. Something greater than food. Than dessert even. He grabs my hand. We walk in and are swiftly greeting and seated.

Throughout our night, we talk about life, love, family, and our failures. Whatever he asked, I willfully gave. He did the same. I've never been this open with a man this soon. This was new. It felt new but it also felt good. I felt his covering, his safety. He cared. Chauncey made sure to keep a devoted eye on me the entire time. He was honest and sincere. The food came to the table but he looked more appealing to me than the steak on his plate. We ate. He complimented me on being myself with him. I did the same. After dinner, we went go back to the hotel. During the elevator ride up, he kept my hand in his. Held it tightly. The elevator arrives to the 15th floor. We get off and finally went to Chauncey's room.

He walks in. I walk in. He closes the door behind me. He walks, places his phone on the table. His Beats pill pours out a song—.for me—.on repeat.

"I love Donny Hathaway," Sasha says

"It's one of my favorites too." Chauncey says. He extends his hand my way and asks, "Will you dance with me?"

I look at Chauncey, grant him a smile and girlishly replies, "It would be my pleasure."

Chauncey pulls me in to him, placing his hands around my waist. We dance slowly to the song playing in the background. My heart wants to scream, but my composure is settled. Here I am. Dancing in a room with the man that steals my dreams at night. My mouth desires to utter things only his flesh would respond to but instead I say, "I want to thank you for everything tonight. The dress, the shoes, jewelry, dinner—everything. It was amazing."

"You deserve it. I've never met anyone like you before, Sasha. No one has ever pulled me out of me more than you have this weekend. Your charisma and ambiance is amazing."

We keep dancing. Swaying with the music. Being overtaken by the rhythm of the night. Chauncey looks at me. His eyes peering down into my soul. He kisses me and my mind spasms. I pull back, give him a warm smile and repays his gifted kiss with another.

He turns me around and slowly kisses my neck. He carefully unzips my dress with his big, warm hands. The dress descends to the floor then he turns me back around. I find myself back. Back in his view. Facing him eye to eye. My soul open, my mind available. I look up into his brown eyes beaming down at me. Then I solicit a kiss. He obliges. I unbutton his white shirt. Black button by black button my body yields to his. The shirt falls to the floor. Rubbing my hands across his broad shoulders, the smell of his cologne ignites my senses while I remove his undershirt. I escort him to the bed and connect with him. Our lips meet again; Lock and key. His tongue mixing with mine; creating a deep and passionate background to our night.

Chauncey caresses my breasts with both hands. He removes my bra. He slowly places his lips around my nipples. The warmth of his tongue makes my nipples his candy. I looked down, unzipped his pants. Not a word uttered. Our bodies spoke a language men couldn't interpret. I reached to remove my underwear. He places his hand over mine. "Baby, Let me." I surrendered to his invitation. His boxers and my underwear became more tenants of the floor. Our tongues dance again. He pushes my legs into my chest and thrusts into my love slowly. What he wanted to give me he had it the whole time. He gave me himself. Never have I ever experienced such fiery passion. He looks at me. I look at him—carefully observing every emotion, every sensation makes its way to the forefront. His body desired my body. His mind, my mind. Like two pieces finally finding their niche in the puzzle of ecstasy. He longed for me and I was eager for him.

"Chauncey—mmm—" I moaned deeply

"Baby—I—mmm—just wanted to show you how much—"

"Ahh—mm—mmm—"

"How much I appreciate you—" Chauncey says. Each thrust gaining strides. The more he pushes in and out, the more I leave traces of my love on him. I needed more. He needed more. He went deeper and deeper. Drowning in the sea of my sweet love and I with every stroke of his rod of pleasure.

"Love—"Chauncey calls out to me with his lips. Partially open. He bites down on his bottom lip.

"Yes." I respond

"You mean the world to me. I never want to lose you. Can I have you? Say you'll be mine."

"Yes, Chauncey. I'm yours."

"Say that again for me, love. I need to hear you say it again."

I tell him I am his and it excites him. His movements speed up like a man desperate to see me fulfilled. Determined to pleasure me, his hips grind inside my thighs. His brown skin melts and mixes with the chocolate undertones of mine. My love clenches around his rod of pleasure and I escape into a world of orgasmic metamorphosis. At that moment he finds his appointed place inside me he releases himself. His warm vanilla-like juices fill my love cup. Overflowing with emotion, memories and euphoria, my body drank from it relentlessly. He lay his head in between my breasts— his rod of pleasure still lingering inside me. Limp. Empty. Satisfied. I gently rub his head. We lay there. Music playing softly in the background.

It was in this moment that we found each other. Found our missing link. We became one in body, one in mind, one in spirit and we found love's abyss.
