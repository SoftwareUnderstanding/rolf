### This ebook is a collection of answers given by Jesus (AJ Miller) on the topic of emotions and feelings. The answers were given in an interview with Mary Magdalene (Mary Luck), who posed frequently asked questions from members of the media and public, on 4th June 2014 in Wilkesdale, Queensland, Australia. In this session Jesus discusses issues such as; what causes us to detune from our emotions, technical issues relating to the brain and how it responds to emotional suppression, what are the original causes of fear and why we let fear determine the course of our life's experiences.

0. Introductory Comments

**Mary:** Welcome everyone, to Session Seven of our series on Emotions. I'm here again today with Jesus, who is going to be answering some of the questions that you have sent in, on the topic of emotions and feelings. Before you proceed with watching this section of the questions though, we really recommend, if you haven't already, that you go back and watch the Human Soul sessions. We did three on the Human Soul and those sessions provide a really good introductory framework, to what we are now continuing to talk about, so we recommend that you view those, before you look at what we're about to speak about today. Also, if you're wanting a more basic introduction to some of the grounding information, or the information that we're building upon in this series, we recommend that you watch Session Two and Three, of this series on Emotions and Feelings. Today we're continuing with this series, with personal questions that people have sent in to us. We hope that you find it really helpful and enjoyable.

1. What do I do after I have removed negative people from my life?

**Mary:** Over the past five years, I've come to stand up to the negative baggage of so-called family and friends weighing me down. It was actually a psychologist, another type of 'life coach', who urged me to make the tough decision to get rid of these negative forces, regardless of whether they were coming from my mother, best mate, or a colleague. I've done so, and now find myself with virtually no one in my life. Although I feel less stress and negativity in my life, it's left me completely at a loss to understand, "where to next?"

Well firstly, I think that the life coach or psychologist that recommended these particular things to this man, I think it is, did a good job with him, with his recommendations. If people are attempting to pull us down, being negative in our lives and so forth, we do want to make sure that at some point in time we make it clear to those people that we're not going to put up with that kind of treatment, because it is actually quite abusive type of treatment, so I feel that the psychologist gave him very, very good advice. The only problem with most of these pieces of advice is that they don't focus on the soul at all. They focus on doing something rather than fixing something in the soul itself, and this is the problem that this man faces.

When we fix something in the soul, things change in our life. What will happen is, when we start to remove people who have been negative in our life away from our life, and we actually work through the soul-based emotions regarding that, what will happen is eventually those people will not be attracted to us at all anyway. Eventually we get to the point where we don't even attract people who are negative into our lives anymore. Then we go through this period generally where we don't really understand what to do, because we are yet to attract positive people into our life. We're yet to take some kinds of personal steps, again emotional, that we need to take in order to attract positive people into our lives. This is what has happened to this man.

What's happened here is, the recommendation to him to remove the negative people, which was a great recommendation, he's followed through with action, without actually releasing the emotions that caused the attraction to these people in the first place. Now while you do that, you won't be attracting new people into your life, and there will still be a tendency for those people who are negative to come into your life. It will just be different people who are negative coming into your life, and of course you'll ask them to get out of your life as well. The net result will be that you'll end up with no people in your life, or very few people in your life. That's an indication that you haven't done the soul work that needs to be done, with regard to the people that you have removed from your life. What I would recommend firstly is to start looking at what emotions within this man would be still causing the attraction to be that either no one, or no one positive, comes into his life.

These attractions, these soul based attractions, are all based around emotions, and they're all based around emotions from our childhood. Therefore they are things that he is going to have to work through with his mother and father, both genders, with regard to what kind of oppression he felt during his childhood, what before then was causing him to allow the oppression even as an adult by these people, and what feelings he has about those particular things. What's happened is that he has not truly felt about these things. If he truly feels about these things he will find that he will release from himself the emotions that cause the attraction, so he will no longer have to take the action anymore to prevent these kinds of people from being in his life because they will automatically no longer be attracted to his life.

He will also then start attracting people who are more positive. Now in terms of the group of emotions he needs to experience, well that's again another discussion in itself, because there are a large group of emotions that a person needs to go through and experience, if they are in a place where they have removed negative people from their life but not attracted any positive people. These kinds of emotions are generally related to the negative people themselves, and what kinds of things he feels about that. There are feelings associated with loneliness, hopelessness, and other kinds of emotions. There are also feelings where there is still this internal allowance of negative behaviour towards oneself; that's a lot about one's self esteem and self worth, and working through childhood reasons why that worth is low.

If he looks at the people that he has removed, and I suggest with this man he has found that a lot of it has had to be family-based problems, so he's removed some of these family-based influences that were negative, he would be best to go back and visit these family places, not visit the people specifically, but go back emotionally and work through the feelings associated with these family members that are still present within him, and allow himself to be more sensitive to the emotions that are within him regarding these particular matters. If he does that, then what he will find is that he will start attracting positive people into his life. At the moment his soul is still not attracting positive people into his life, and that's an indication that there are still things he needs to work through from an emotional perspective. Even though he's done the right thing by taking actions, there's still more work to do before it becomes an emotional shift, the true soul-based shift in his life.

I feel that's the problem with taking actions a lot of the times. We take actions that we know are right, but we don't address the emotions associated with them and unfortunately that means that very little improvement can actually occur. If we deal with the emotions large improvements will occur. He will be surrounded by very loving people, and people who want to do the same thing as he does, once he addresses those particular issues.

2. I now find Divine Truth difficult & challenging! What can I do?

**Mary:** When I was first introduced to the Divine Truth through a friend in Coffs Harbour, my soul was singing and I even did some emotional processing, but now that I am back home I avoid feeling emotions, and I can't make myself watch another DVD. I'm guessing that the Divine Love Path is very long and challenging and just wanted to ask you if you had felt this same way that I do now? Maybe you could give me a few ideas for getting back in touch with my emotions?

Well I suppose there are a lot of things I could say here. Many people do experience this thing that happens, which is, that right at the beginning you become quite enthusiastic about the new external truths that you are hearing, and then as you go on you realise that there are internal things that you are going to have to face, and so you shut down completely. You don't want to do any more, and you don't want to watch any more, and you don't want to listen any more, and you don't want to know any more, and you don't want to pray any more, and you don't want to do anything. It's quite clear what's happening, I feel, for a person who is doing this. Firstly they don't want to come face-to-face with the personal truth in their lives, so the first step is to try to come face-to-face.

Now she asked me the question, "Have I ever been through that?" No, I haven't. I'm sorry but the reason I haven't is that I want to come face-to-face with the personal truth in my life. I don't feel resistive to Divine Truth ever. I'm always fascinated by God and God's Truths and I feel that everybody would be unless they have some major blocks, or major fears, or major addictions that they don't want to give up.

Now for the average person who comes into contact with Divine Truth there are initially a lot of addictions for them. The majority of people are very, very happy to find out about external truth; they're very happy to find out that God's loving and not a punishing God, and they're very happy to find out the way the Universe is constructed, and they're very happy to find out that there's a spirit world and there's life after death. They're very happy about all of those external, what I would call knowledge-based, things about the Universe, but when it comes to personal reflection they become very, very unhappy.

And they're very resistive. They do not wish to go through anything personally. They don't want to feel anything. They don't want to feel their personal pain, and they don't want to progress and connect to their emotions, and connect to the emotional pain that's stored within them. That is usually because there's a lot of anger. Then there are a lot of addictions that drive the anger, and there are a lot of fears that are usually underneath a person being so resistive. Now this lady is very angry about having to make any personal progress, and while we can remain in this kind of anger for long periods of time, the question we've got to ask ourselves is, "What do I really want? How am I going to use my will?"

See, if I really want a relationship with God I won't let such things stop me. If I really want to continue growing for the rest of my existence I won't let a few painful emotions, and when I say a few, it might be ten years of painful emotions for some people, but it's highly unlikely if they allowed their emotions all the time. However, let's say it is ten years.

Surely ten years of some painful emotions is worth, like, thousands of years of joy in terms of making that progress. I feel, firstly, a person who is in this state does not have faith in God, does not have faith that they actually can work through emotions. They don't have faith that actually The Way is about having to do soul-based work on emotions. They want there to be some other way of getting closer to God, and there is no other way.

I think it's wonderful that there is no other way because you can't manufacture it, you can't skip over things, you've got to be really sincere to be on this path, so my suggestion to this lady and others is, the question really is, "Are you sincere about truth?" I'm suggesting to you that if you're resistive to personal truth, then you're not really sincere about truth and you could then later say to God, "Oh well, I didn't know this, and I didn't know that."

If you're resistive to personal truth, that's the exercise of your will to resist the truth and you can't blame anybody other than yourself for that. You can't blame your parents for that, you can't blame your childhood for that, you can't even blame all the painful emotions inside of you for that. That's your personal resistance to truth and you need to somehow decide to work your way through it.

Now usually when a person is this resistive, they are usually angry that they have to do it and usually that anger is a lot around things like, "Somebody else put these emotions in me so somebody else should have to take them out" - type of reasoning." Wanting to blame other people for the pain that you feel, and all these kinds of feelings are a part of the anger. Now the anger is an indication that you are in addiction, and also that you don't understand love at all, actually, because any person who regularly gets angry does not understand love at all.

So my suggestion there is to face up to your addictions. Be honest about them; be truthful about them. Do you even really want to progress? Because if you don't really want to progress why bother even doing it? If there's no internal desire in you to progress on the path then don't do it, but you are going to bear the consequences of such a decision, you are. You're going to have a much less happy life in the long term. You are also going to have much more struggle in your life in the short and long term because you're resistive to God's whole universal structure of love, and if you're honest with yourself, you don't really want to become more loving. You've got to look at why you wouldn't want to become more loving. Now sometimes it's anger that is driving that. Sometimes it's addictions driving that and sometimes it's fear driving that.

For the person who is angry then, there are usually a lot of justifying emotions for their rage. For the person who is in their addictions, they just don't want to get rid of their addictions because they're afraid that if they get rid of their addictions there will be nothing left - and that's often the case once you start doing that, so they don't want to get rid of their addictions. They definitely don't want to come face-to-face with their fears, and have to work their way through them as a child would work their way through these emotions.

I feel that this is a very important thing: we need to, at some point, decide that we're going to actually feel these childlike emotions that are still locked up within us and that we actually use our will in a positive manner to become more loving. The only way we're going to become more loving from God's perspective is by removing from ourselves, through experiencing these emotions, removing the emotions that cause us to be unloving. And if we're not sincere about that process, yes, you're going to find the Divine Truth path, or "The Way," very, very difficult, in fact, impossible.

God has constructed it in such a manner. God has constructed it that you have to be sincere. You have to have a true longing for God, and you have to have a true longing to know the truth about yourself and the truth about the Universe. You can't just know the truth about the Universe and ignore all the truths about yourself, because you're living in the Universe, and everything that happens to you is going to be based around loving laws trying to correct your unloving ways.

Of course, how long it takes is going to be completely dependent upon how willing you are. If you are very unwilling it's going to take hundreds and hundreds of years, maybe thousands of years. And there are many people who've taken tens of thousands of years. That's an exercise of your will. Or, it can only take a few years if you exercised your will differently, but it's going to depend a lot upon you.

Some of her questions I feel, I don't know, demonstrate a lack of faith in God, demonstrate a lack of faith in The Way, and I'm not saying she has to have faith in God or faith in The Way, but does she want to have? What does she want to do with her life? Also, she's basically saying that she's guessing the Divine Love Path is very long and challenging, and I go, "Well no, the Divine Love Path is actually forever." It's not just long, it's going to be the rest of your life, forever, you know. I suppose that's very, very, very, very long if you look at it that way, but it's only challenging when we resist everything. This is what I find quite strange: people have all of these challenges on the Path, and they don't acknowledge that the challenges are the direct result of their own resistance.

**Mary:** Can I ask you about challenges then? Because it seems to me that challenges are difficult when we resist them, but we can have challenges that we embrace. The error, for example, is going to be challenged by truth, but if we're a willing party to that challenge then it's not such an arduous or difficult thing to face that challenge. Is that correct?

No. You enjoy every challenge because you feel, "Oh, this is another opportunity to grow."

You see, once you've received some of God's Love you're a very positive person. You're very optimistic. So you're not pessimistic at all. You don't think, "Oh, isn't this terrible. This is going to last forever" - any of those kinds of things. You feel the complete opposite of that. Because you've received some of God's Love, you know that God's optimistic. God's optimistic that you can do it. God created your soul to do it. You understand these things, and so you feel very optimistic about every challenge. You don't even see them really as challenges, you just see them as, "Wow. This is a great opportunity for me to grow and to change, and why wouldn't I take the opportunity? It's an opportunity that God's given me right in this moment to do that."

I don't even really see them as challenges. I just see them more as events that my soul attracts to demonstrate to me where I'm out of harmony with love, and I have the option, and of course I desire to always take that option, to actually see the truth of what is really going on, to feel about the causal emotions that exist in me that attracted the event, and once I do, I know that I'm never going to have to go through that experience again. Isn't that wonderful?

Most people in their day-to-day life, every single day, have similar experiences that are negative, and they go through them the next day, the next day, the next day. They have no hope that it's not going to happen again, because they don't know how to stop it from happening. I feel that The Way shows you how to stop it all from happening, and to actually embrace a life that's much more positive, much more enjoyable. You also feel much more inner joy, because you know you're working your way through fears. You're getting rid of addictions, you know you're becoming a more loving person, that love is demonstrated through your actions to other people and also to yourself. You become happier as a result, not sadder, happier as a result. I feel there are so many positive benefits for following The Way for the rest of your existence, so why wouldn't you do it? I can't understand why a person would choose not to do it.

Now because of her choices to resist her rage, and resist her addictions, and resist knowing about her fears and feeling them, and to resist feeling her inner pain, which is the real problem, of course she is going to be shut down to emotions. And of course she's not going to want to watch any DVDs about Divine Truth. Fair enough. Why watch something that's just going to tell you that you need to connect to something that you don't want to connect to?

My suggestion to her is to look at the reasons why rather than ignoring the reasons why. Why doesn't she want to? A lot of times, it is all about, "I'm afraid I will lose my family, I'll lose my friends. I'm afraid." When we start listing it all down, we find that there are literally hundreds of reasons why we don't want to do it, but to me, no matter how many reasons why we don't want to do it, the reasons for doing it are far more powerful, and outweigh any reason we can have for not doing it. That's what keeps me going. That's what keeps me progressing, and I suggest to her that that's one of the things that she would also need to do.

She would need to see the real good reasons for doing it, and if she doesn't, then, "Talk about that. Ask questions about that so that you can gain some faith, so that you feel a lot more comfortable and confident about there being a good reason to do it."

I feel that the best reason is to have a relationship with the Creator of the Universe. That's the best reason. The second best reason is that I get to have a relationship with the other half of myself, and myself, that's real, truthful, honest and full of love. Then, I also get to be a more loving person in all of my interactions with other people and as a result of that I also attract more loving interactions with other people.

Now I think that's fantastic. Why wouldn't you want to choose those things? Whatever excuses or reasons you've come up with for not doing it, none of them are as large as those reasons for doing it.

**Mary:** If I recap a little on what you said - that's very motivating what you've just been saying, but it is something that we commonly hear from people. "Look, I'm just so emotionally shut down," and this lady is asking, "How can I get back in touch with my emotions?" You've listed quite a few things that obviously this lady is in resistance to. You listed a resistance to personal truth ...

Well let's start even before then. She has no faith that doing it will actually benefit her in any way. That's the first thing, and then, because she has no faith, she's got a complete resistance to personal truth. So at some stage faith has to be developed in the process.

Now the only way you can really develop faith in a process is to engage the process and see what the outcome is. Once you've engaged the process enough and you see the outcome is consistently good then you go, "Why would I not do this?" So she needs to build her faith, and the only way you can really build your faith is by engaging a process as an experiment and seeing what the outcomes are, truly are, and then allowing yourself to measure that and remember that. I feel that's where she needs to start.

Then, once she has enough faith, she'll perhaps want to have a look at her resistance to personal truth. So yes, the resistance to personal truth is an issue, but it's probably the second issue.

**Mary:** If we say that the first issue is a resistance to something you alluded to earlier, external truth, the fact that it's worthwhile and that we can have faith in the process. Then a resistance to personal truth, a resistance to seeing addictions and anger and fear.

Well, a resistance to not just seeing them, but feeling them. Feeling her anger, feeling her addictions, feeling her fear and feeling her pain. She's worried that her life will change so she doesn't want to do it. If you don't want to do it, don't, but you are going to bear the consequences of not doing it. I don't advise it but what else can I say? You're allowed to make the choice to not do it. God says to you, "You're allowed to be where you are right now for the rest of your existence if that's what you want."

The question I would ask myself if I was her is, "Do I want that? Do I want to live the current life I have for the rest of my existence?" Because that's what I'm going to do if I don't change. If I don't embrace some kind of change that's real, I'm going to live this life not only all the way through my life on Earth, but I'm also going to live it in the Spirit World.

That's going to be a pretty mundane life for the rest of my existence unless I decide to do something different. My suggestion to her is: there is plenty of motivation to do something different, there's plenty of truth to motivate you to do something different, you've just got to question about whether you really believe any of it. The only way you can improve your belief is by reading, studying, experimenting, and to do that you're probably going to have to watch a few DVDs to help you. Unfortunately. (Laughs)

**Mary:** I think it's an interesting question in that I know a lot of people who just sort of say, "Oh, I was feeling emotion and "Oop," the emotion ran out. It sort of went away."

I'm so amused by that because that's an indication that fear and addictions just kicked in.

**Mary:** Exactly, and I suppose that's what I wanted to highlight because I've been one of those people where I just went, "Oop, it's all gone. It dried up." It's easy to sort of throw your hands up and go, "Oh that's nothing to do with me. I wonder what it is?" and not really think, "It's actually because there's something that I want to avoid right now. A fear or an addiction that I'm purposefully avoiding, which has caused the emotions to dry out." Because I know that when we first met I thought emotions were just like, "What are emotions? I don't know." I didn't even like having them.

Yes, well when I started I didn't know what they were either so that's okay. I feel that everybody gets to that stage, but to get beyond any of these stages you've got to develop a desire, and that's an exercise of your will. Do you want to have a desire to get closer to God, to get closer to love, to become a more loving person, to receive some of God's Love so your soul transforms? Do you want that or don't you?

Now a person who just does a little bit of progress and then stops, my suggestion is: "Your desire isn't that big. It's not that big, so what would you do to develop your desire? You would have to work through the fears that you have, but you would also have to look at your will. Do you really want truth? Do you really want love? What do you really feel about those things? You're going to have to have a little bit more self-analysis rather than just asking Jesus, "What's my problem?"

**Mary:** That probably goes for a lot of questions, doesn't it.

It does, and this is the thing with these emotion questions. I think we've covered a lot of the basic issues regarding emotions already. A lot of these individual questions, while they are interesting and give us a way to illustrate the problems that people face, at the end of the day, asking somebody else what's going on for you, while it can help you work through what's going on for yourself, you've got to first ask yourself how strong is your personal desire to really do it anyway? To really know anyway?

Honestly, I often see that the biggest issue people face is the lack of a strong will to actually want to love. To want to know truth no matter what, even if I die finding it. There's very little of that. People want to have mundane existences because they get to avoid a whole heap of things and they like avoidance. They like their addictions being met. They want comfort.

Basically they want to be nursed by a mummy for the rest of their life. That's what they want. They don't want to grow up and become a self-functioning, self-sufficient adult who has a relationship with God, a relationship with love, a relationship with truth that is unbreakable and immovable, unable to be moved by any event or situation, or person in their life.

To become that kind of a person, which is the kind of person you will become when you become at-one with God, you've got to go through quite a lot of stuff first. You've got to work your way through, and be sincere about working your way through, a lot of very negative emotions that you've imbibed through your life, and also a lot of the bad choices that you've made that you need to repent for before you'll become that person. My suggestion is, it's worth it.

I'm shocked that anybody thinks it's not. (Laughs.) But I understand that when they begin, a lot of people realise that their will isn't very well developed and they have very little faith, and they've only ever wanted to have their ears tickled as the Bible says, and not really want to have to work through issues.

This is a problem that we face on the planet. We live in a society now, particularly Western society, where everything is about instant gratification. If we do five minutes of spiritual progression we think, "Oh, it should be all over now." You know, we did ten minutes of crying, "Oh, that's finished." To be frank, no, it didn't enter you in ten minutes. It entered you over years and years and years generally, of oppression. How can you expect that something that's entered you over years and years and years is only going to take ten minutes or half an hour, days, weeks, or even months?

It's going to take you years, to be frank, and there's nothing you're going to be able to do about that because it's already there. You're just carrying it around anyway, and if you don't do anything about it you're going to keep carrying it around, keep causing yourself damage, other people damage, never having a relationship with God, never being the powerful expression of the person you could be. Why would you want to choose that? That makes no sense to choose that from a logical perspective, so I would just encourage this lady to look at those things we've mentioned.

In amongst those things are some of the reasons why she has stopped the emotional processing, and honestly, once she has worked through those feelings she will probably feel attracted to listening to or watching some DVDs, although they're not DVDs any more, they're videos on YouTube or whatever. She would also probably be much more attracted to really developing her relationship with God, her relationship with herself, her relationship with her soulmate, developing the love which comes out of her, wanting to know the truth about her life. Not only the external things, but wanting to know the truth about her life, what's happened to her, the feelings that she has, and feeling those feelings because she is going to feel alive when she does. That's what I would recommend to her.

**Mary:** It really is worth it, hey?

3. What does it look like to be a 100% emotional being?

**Mary:** Our next question comes to us from Nicky, and it's a little bit lengthy so bear with me while I read it out.

**Mary:** She says, "I am someone (others tell me) who lacks emotional expression. I assume the average person feels and shows their emotion. Now I imagine a simplified emotional spectrum..."

Can I say firstly, the average person doesn't feel and show their emotion. Perhaps more than she does... I've met Nicky and I find that many people who have an Asian background, which Nicky does have, have been heavily suppressed emotionally during their childhood, and so they do find emotional expression difficult, but don't assume that everybody finds it easy and you find it difficult. The reality is that pretty much everyone on the planet finds it difficult to express true emotion.

**Mary:** Okay. Well, she's imagining an emotional spectrum. There's her - the average person - the very emotional - and the goal. "Whatever that is."

And that's indeterminate I gather?

**Mary:** Yes. She's not quite sure what that is at the moment. She gives an example. "I know at least one person who is more emotional than the average person. She easily and quite frequently cries."

Oh, see this is where it goes off board doesn't it? But keep going, I suppose it's best if we read the whole thing.

**Mary:** This is where the spectrum is not quite accurate, is it?

Let's read the whole question and then we'll go back to each point and I'll make comments about each point.

**Mary:** Sure. So, this person Nicky knows, "Easily and quite frequently cries. Her husband gives her much to cry about because he is not very active in life, compulsively spends what little they have, plus he has a drug addiction. Despite her crying for many years things did not change much.

**Mary:** Well finally, just this year, he is making the attempt to quit and to change. I wonder, shouldn't her life have changed already since she has been feeling her emotions? Or is that it? I am to be like her? Or is it not? Being someone who "lacks emotional expression," and observing others who freely show their emotions, I just get confused. Because even though they are emotional, that's still not it. Not the goal.

**Mary:** Is it because she's (again, back to her friend) still resisting anger and child-like emotions? Is it because she has demands and expectations? Is she somehow addicted to that side of him? I think my main question is: what does a 100% emotional being look like? What's it like to be in their company and to observe them?"

Well let's answer that part of the question first. My suggestion to Nicky is to have a look at the recent talks we did that were done in 2014 called "Understanding Your Emotional Self." There are four of them done in a series, and the reason I recommend to you that you have a look at those four particular videos (which will probably be about twelve hours of viewing in the end, sorry about that) is that you will start to understand what it's going to look like to be your true emotional self.

Those presentations answer the questions about what it looks like to be your true emotional self. I don't think we need to say much more on that subject, because the best thing for people to do is to go to those particular videos, which were seminars done with a small group of people in New South Wales in Australia. The topic was "Relationship with God - Understanding Your Emotional Self," and there are four sessions.

**Mary:** If we go back to Nicky's story then ...

Let's look at the story, because there are comments we need to make about stories.

**Mary:** Really she's asking a kind of question from someone who is not feeling very much emotion herself. She's observing people being emotional, and then saying, "Is that what I'm supposed to do?" And this is the problem when we're not very sensitive to our own emotions, isn't it? That we have problems interpreting what's going on.

Yes. Firstly we need to make comments about why we're not sensitive to our own emotion. That is because we are either in complete denial of our own emotion, or we're terrified of feeling our emotions. Now most people who are in complete denial or terrified of feeling their emotions, have had a very difficult childhood emotionally. What that means is that they were taught at a very, very young age to not feel their emotions, and so it does take a fair bit of time, and self-reflection and self-analysis, to be able to start allowing yourself to feel what you really feel.

That's going to take... it's like a softening of your soul, I suppose you could call that. That's also going to take looking at the issues of suppression, which is what we discussed in How The Human Soul Functions, looking at the areas of resistance and suppression, and also all of the rules, if you like, of how the soul functions.

You need to understand that you're not going to be able to absorb new things into your soul from an emotional perspective unless some of the old things leave you. If one of those old things happens to be a belief about emotions, then of course that is one of the first things you're going to have to address, so I would recommend firstly for such a person to look much more sincerely at how the soul functions. Rather than seeing it as, "I'm not an emotional person; you are an emotional person," understand that every single person has been created by God to be an emotional being, and if we're not then it's because there's damage that has been done to our soul. Instead of saying, "I am not an emotional person," which is basically saying, "I am that unemotional being," you're better off saying, "I am a person who has been damaged quite a lot, and I don't feel my emotions well as a result."

In other words, you start to see not being an emotional person as damage, rather than seeing it as part of your natural personality, because it's not a part of your true nature and personality. It's a part of the hurt person that's inside of you, and not a part of the real person who is inside of you. That's the first thing you need to come to terms with.

**Mary:** Would you like me to read back through the question so you can comment as we go?

Yes, let's go back over it now. We've answered the question as to the general comments about saying, "I am an emotional person, and that person's not an emotional person," or the so-called "emotional spectrum"? I don't agree with any of those things because all of us, and I've lived in the Celestial kingdoms, so I know that every single person who is in the Celestial spheres is an emotional being, and they don't look like her friend crying all the time, by the way, so we need to define what it looks like.

**Mary:** Can we talk about ...

Well I feel that I defined that a lot in the sessions, "Understanding Your Emotional Self," so rather than regurgitating all of that information, I think we need to look at her specific situation and make comments about it.

**Mary:** Alright. So, she says one person she knows is more emotional than the average person. "She easily and quite frequently cries. Her husband gives her much to cry about because he is just not very active in life, compulsively spends what little they have, plus he has a drug addiction."

It's very interesting here, you see. See, Nicky is seeing it as if her friend's husband is the problem. This woman, her friend, her husband is the problem. It's not the problem. The problem is that this woman has no self-love at all, and when she's crying, she's not crying any causal emotion. What she's doing is, she's having a tantrum about somebody else - her husband not loving her and causing her trouble, but she doesn't want to leave this man. She doesn't want to have to love herself. In this relationship, this woman is hanging around in a relationship where she doesn't have to love herself. She doesn't want to love herself and she wants this man to love her. She wants this man to do all of her work for her basically, emotionally. She wants this man to provide all of her emotional needs.

Now of course she's attracted a man, under these circumstances you will, who doesn't do that, who spends all your money and doesn't make you feel safe and secure, financially, and who abuses alcohol or drugs or something else, and that makes you feel like the alcohol or the drugs is the most important thing in his life and not you, and a lot of other reasons. Then of course this person, the woman, starts crying about these things, and all of her crying is just having a tantrum about the fact she is not getting what she wants. Now that is not processing causal emotions. She's not even processing her anger about how she feels, and she certainly doesn't want to love herself.

If she wanted to love herself she wouldn't, for one moment more, put up with that situation. She would say to the man, "Look, I love you but I must also love myself in this circumstance or situation and that requires that I leave you for a while, while you sort yourself out and while you get rid of your drugs or alcohol," or whatever other abusive issue he has towards himself, "and while you take more self-responsibility in your life. I will need to work through all of my addictions as to why I haven't done this twenty years ago. What caused me to stay in this relationship for such a long time, or ten years or however long it is, what caused me to stay in this relationship for such a long time while it's abusive towards myself?"

Now, this woman does not want to become more loving. She wants her husband to become more loving and she doesn't want to have to change herself. She doesn't want her life to change without her husband doing all the work. That's not the way it's going to work on the Divine Truth Path. That's not The Way. So this woman may be crying but she is not working through any causal emotion from her childhood.

**Mary:** And this is where seeing tears as emotional processing, we can really go wrong there, can't we?

Totally. Yes, because tears aren't emotional processing. A lot of people I see in tears are really in rages, and this woman is in a rage actually. She's using tears; she learnt to use tears in her childhood as an emotionally abusive technique to manipulate somebody into doing something she wants, and it's not working. Good. It shouldn't work and it's not working but she's then saying that it's really all her husband's fault. No, she's got a lot of issues to work through about her love of herself; she's got a lot of growing to do about how she's not loving herself.

She's also not loving her husband, because she's putting up with this kind of treatment over and over again, and a person who truly values the truth and values love would not do so, so she's not loving her husband and she's not honouring anything in fact. She's not honouring her children, herself, or her husband in this situation. She is teaching her children that they should put up with abusive situations, that they should put up with an abusive father, you know, somebody who abuses. I don't mean he's abusive to them, he may or may not be, but he's definitely abusive to himself.

You wouldn't put up with that. Like, if you really loved someone you would go, "No, I don't want you to abuse yourself. You work out why you want to abuse yourself, and I'm going to go away from you while you do that," or, "I'll help you to work your way through it if you're willing. But I'm not going to put up with this anymore." That's what you would do if you love yourself, and this woman doesn't want to do that.

Real growth has to be growth in love and truth, and this woman is not growing in love and truth. She is feeling some emotions but none of them are related to her own childhood and her own upbringing, which has obviously caused her to accept this kind of treatment from her husband. She has no desire to address her internal problems, and as a result she cries about her husband all the time.

It's interesting that the observer, Nicky in this case, doesn't see that, which indicates that Nicky herself probably has the same kind of tolerances to abusive behaviour from other people.

**Mary:** That's an important point you just made, that often when we have a similar injury we find it difficult to see the error in it, when it's in another.

And the error in this lady that Nicky's describing, is that she doesn't want to love herself. She doesn't want to. Lots of people don't want to love themselves for all sorts of reasons. Some people believe that if they love themselves then it lets everybody else off the hook. Which it does, actually. That's what love does. It lets everybody off the hook, but they don't like that idea. They get angry about that idea and they don't want to do that. Or they feel like people should love them. They demand love, and so forth. Now of course love demanded isn't love anyway. Love is always a gift; there is a misunderstanding about love in that. There are a lot of misunderstandings about love that would cause a person to cry about their husband's abusive behaviour.

**Mary:** I don't know quite how to put this into words, or even into a question, but I will do my best. What I have noticed is that whenever there is a release of causal emotion, tears, and if we use, because Nicky is talking about tears, and usually causal emotion is released by tears ...

Well not necessarily, no. If it's fear you might be shaking, terrified perhaps. If it's shame you'll be hot flushes, allowing yourself to feel that. It just depends on the emotion as to what it is.

**Mary:** Sure. Okay, but usually, because you were talking about the misunderstandings of love that this lady has...

... which were all created in her childhood, so she needs to go back to her inner child, if you could use that expression. Or you could say, and more correctly say, she needs to go back into her damaged child, which is the hurt child within, the second of the Three Selves. Remember the Three Selves? There are the Real Self, the Hurt Self, the Facade Self. This woman is in her Facade Self, and all of the processing she's doing in that place doesn't mean a single thing. She can go on doing that for the next fifty years.

**Mary:** Can we even call it processing?

No. It's not processing because processing is all about feeling the Hurt Self, or feeling the reasons why you constructed your Facade Self, which are all based upon the Hurt Self.

**Mary:** My observation is that there is always truth in causal processing.

Always, but it's also always childhood, or repentance. It's only those two things. In this case, the lady needs to repent for the way that she's treating herself. She is obviously treating herself this way because of something that occurred in her childhood that made her have a predisposition to treating herself this way.

**Mary:** There's always an element of truth of what happened in our childhood, or truth in the way that we've harmed another, when we are releasing a causal emotion.

Always.

**Mary:** So this lady is not connected with truth on either level?

No. No truth about love at all, no truth about herself, no truth about her husband. He doesn't care. He loves drugs more than he loves her. There's no truth about that.

**Mary:** And she's also not being truthful about the way that she is attempting to manipulate him?

That's right. She's emotionally manipulating him. She's using a technique that many women use, because when they get angry with a man who is abusing substances, the man gets angry in return, probably becoming physically violent, and they don't want that, so they use tears as a way of emotionally manipulating the man to change his behaviour. However, that's a learnt response from her own childhood, but it is manipulative and it's out of harmony with love. It's where she's not being loving to him. You don't manipulate a person when you want their behaviour to change. You just say, "I need your behaviour to change because it's this and that, and this and that, which is all unloving, and if you don't do that... I'm just saying that I'm going to leave you until you do that." You wouldn't even say, "If you do that", or, "Don't do that", you would just go, "I'm going to leave you until you do that. And when you're ready, when you think you've done that, give me a call because I still love you. I still care about you, still love you, I still want to be with you, I just can't put up with that behaviour."

**Mary:** Okay. So then if we go back to the start of Nicky's question where she is imagining a spectrum where she's on one end, the average person ...

I suppose she's saying, like, "shut down, shut down".

**Mary:** Totally shut down, she's saying. The average person, the very emotional person, and the goal, and she's saying her friend is in this very emotional category.

I don't feel so.

**Mary:** Which is further along the spectrum than Nicky, but is that really a fair statement?

No, not at all. Her friend is in her addictions and using manipulative techniques in her passive-aggressive rage to manipulate this situation, or attempt to, and she's not going to have much success doing it, to be frank, because that's what her soul's needing to learn. She needs to learn that anytime you attempt to manipulate the person using emotional techniques, it's not loving, and she needs to learn that. She is in a just as shut down, or an even more shut down, place than Nicky herself is.

**Mary:** Which is very interesting isn't it? It seems to me that the spectrum is not a spectrum of emotionality. It's about a spectrum of love and truth, and our emotions do grow as we progress along that spectrum.

Well, our emotions become real. See, this woman's emotions are all facade and that's not real. None of that is real, and it's only when you start feeling the hurt child, or where you've caused hurt to others, the two sides of things... The hurt child is all about forgiving others, and feeling what you've done to others is all about repentance. It's only when you start feeling those two groups of emotions that you actually make any soul-based progress, and once you do that you will start seeing glimpses, and eventually whole parts of your inner self, the self that God created, the real true self that God created.

This woman is completely in her facade. She is completely shut down to all of her true self, and I'm saying "this woman", the woman that Nicky is describing, her friend, is shut down completely. Now Nicky herself is shut down too. She's in denial, but she's not using as many emotionally manipulative techniques, because she probably wasn't taught to do that in her childhood. She's using denial and fear as tools to shut herself down.

They are different techniques. I would suggest again, that we need to get out of the facade-based self, and into what's really going on inside of the child, in terms of what happened in the child's life, if we're ever going to make any true progression in our soul.

**Mary:** Okay. I think that we've answered Nicky's question. There are a lot of elements ...

I think so; she says a lot of things down ...

**Mary:** If you look in the third paragraph, perhaps.

She says, "Being someone who lacks emotional expression, and observing others who freely show their emotion, I just get confused." Well, the woman she's using as an example, if that's an example of a person who is freely showing their emotions, then I can't agree. That's a person who is freely demonstrating their facade, and using emotionally manipulative techniques to control others. Now that's not what I'm recommending to people. In fact that's a long way away from what I'm recommending to people. I feel that a person who does those things lacks just as much emotional expression as someone who is completely in denial of their emotions, or completely shut down, like Nicky is. I feel that they're equal. There's not someone who is better than the other, and this is why Nicky's getting confused. She's getting confused because she's judging something by observation, looking at a person, but then she's seeing the person's life not changing.

Now what that indicates, if a person's life isn't changing, then it means nothing is happening. Nothing, no soul-based change is actually going on, so let's be honest. What Nicky needs to do is be honest about these people that she sees being emotional, and go, "Has their life changed? No." If their life hasn't changed then they're not expressing emotions from their true self, or from their hurt self. They're only expressing emotions from their facade self, which is all about anger, rage, passive aggression, using emotion as a manipulative tool to change other people, and so forth. None of that will cause any change. In fact, it will cause a darkening of your soul if you keep doing those kinds of things. I can understand why Nicky might be confused, if she's thinking that's the way to progress because it certainly is not.

And then she says, "... because even though they are emotional, it is still not it." Now there's a feeling in her that she doesn't really trust at this point. That, "No, that can't be it." The reason why this feeling exists is that she is going, "Oh, but her life's not changing, so something's wrong." And she's right. Something is wrong. When a person's life is not changing it means that they're not actually doing the work. You know, it's quite obvious they're not doing the work and quite obvious that their soul isn't changing.

When your soul changes, your life changes, and in fact your life will change quite rapidly. The instant your soul changes, usually within a few minutes your life starts changing. That's how rapidly it occurs, and that applies to your body, your health, your life, your relationships. Everything about your life changes as soon as you actually address something causal. If none of that is occurring then it means that no real change is occurring, and the person who is doing all this so-called "emotional processing," is actually just having a tantrum, and using emotion as a manipulative tool to remain in their facade self. That's what they're doing.

She says, "Is it because she is still resisting anger and childlike emotions?" Yes, she is not only resisting anger and childlike emotions, she is also resisting the fact that she is not loving herself. She is being emotionally manipulative to others which means she is not loving others, and obviously has little desire to become more loving with others, so she is resisting quite a lot of things actually.

And she says, "Is it because she has demands and expectations?" Yes. Demands and expectations all come from your addictions, and this woman is in total addiction with her environment. That's why she remains in an abusive relationship, and she's in total addiction to remaining in that relationship, because it gives her what she needs. Sometimes what we need is to feel superior to another person, or feel better than somebody else, and these are all things that she needs to analyse.

This woman, Nicky's friend, needs to analyse if she's ever going to want to progress emotionally. "She is somehow addicted to that side of him." Yes, she is totally addicted to the man she ended up with, and that's why she stays with him. She's totally addicted for a lot of reasons, and she needs to examine the reasons. Now all of that means that she's in her addictions, and every time she cries it's because her addictions are not getting met, and that's anger. That's not sadness. That's anger. That's an expression of rage, passive-aggressive but rage nevertheless, to her environment that somebody else needs to come and fix this man, or he needs to fix it, in order for her life to improve. No, the only person you need to fix in order for your life to improve is you. Automatically, once you do that your life will improve.

That means the people who don't come along for the ride will leave your life, but they'll do it voluntarily, because they want to, and the people who feel like they want to join you in the progress will come into your life, and they'll do that voluntarily, not because you forced them, and not because you have an addiction with them, and not because you demanded something else of them.

That's part of what being emotional looks like. Now we've already answered her main question I feel, but it was an interesting question because it demonstrates, I feel, what happens to a lot of people. A lot of people look at emotion and they go, "Oh, that's fairly really off, I don't...", and then they go, "Is that what AJ's talking about?" Well no, I'm not talking about that. Definitely not. I'm talking about something that's a sincere, honest process emotionally, that's about connecting to either the hurt child that's in you, or the damage you've done to yourself through harming others, and you need to connect to both if you're ever going to become at-one with God. Eventually, once you do that you'll release some real emotion, and your life will instantly change, and then you'll go, "Wow. This is what it feels like, it's actually quite good."

It's actually quite good because I start to understand, to have faith that if I really change my soul, then I've got the capacity to change everything in my life, and everything in my life will change once I change my soul. Once you understand those particular things, and have faith in that, wow, you can make some very good progress on The Path, because you've come to terms with some very basic truths about The Path itself.

**Mary:** But the process you're describing sounds very personal, so we're not necessarily spewing our emotions out onto other people. We're introspective and reflecting and asking for God's Truth on things, and we're experiencing emotions in that process, but it's not necessarily just whatever emotion we feel is releasing something.

No, because a lot of the emotions we feel come from unloving sources within us, and they are all about our demands and our addictions not being met. As a result they are unloving emotions. They are emotions that perhaps we still need to feel so that we recognise them. We go, "Wow, I really feel like crying now that my husband has spent all my money. Why is that? Why did I even give him the ability to spend all my money?" You start to question those particular things and that's important, because you do need to question those things in order to become more loving of yourself, and more loving of your husband under those circumstances.

So yes, you need to question all those things, but it's going to be a very sincere, honest process, and not a process that is just never-ending crying about the same situation for years and years with no change occurring. That's a passive-aggressive rage, an attempt to manipulate the environment through your crying, and that's not very nice at all. It's actually going to cause a degradation of your own condition, and therefore more pain for you and everyone around you in the longer term. That's not what we're talking about when we're talking about connecting with yourself emotionally.

**Mary:** Thank you very much.

4. I am emotionally releasing fear, but my fear is increasing! What is wrong?

**Mary:** Our next question comes to us from Katherine. She asks, "There are so many different levels of fear - anxiety, agitation, up to full blown terror. I find myself in one of these emotions frequently. I feel I am connecting to some of the emotions causing the fear, but my fear is being ramped up. Is this normal, or am I not feeling the cause?"

Well, good day Katherine. Good to see you again. Yes, something we need to be conscious of, is that usually when we begin emotionally processing any causally-based emotion, childhood emotion, we go through a soul series of stages or steps. Now I've written about them many years ago, and at some point we will probably have a Q&A about those steps because we realise it's something a lot of people have never read and therefore probably don't really understand. But let's go through some general parts of the steps. Firstly you go through an intellectual awareness - or you start with no intellectual awareness and no soul-based awareness. Usually that's where you start. In other words you are in complete denial, both intellectually and emotionally.

Then of course the first step" generally is that we become intellectually more aware. In other words we go, "Well, I must have some emotion because my mum and dad treated me this way, and my school people treated me this way, the teachers treated me that way through my life, so I must have some emotion that I have to feel, but I just can't feel it." This is what I would classify as an intellectual awareness developing but still not much, or not any, emotional awareness. Then as we go down, and I won't illustrate in this discussion all the different steps down into a complete soul-based awareness, but as we go through the intellectual awareness stages, and there are four or five of those, we get to the point where we start becoming emotionally aware. This is what's happened to Katherine with regard to her fear.

Before it was just all a sort of theoretical discussion. Now she's starting to feel some of her fear. She's gone from being completely emotionally unaware of her fear, in other words suppressing this fear, dramatically suppressing it inside of her soul, resisting it completely, which is all about the principles of resistance and suppression in "How the Human Soul Functions." Of course, while she's been resisting and suppressing those things, she's not been very sensitive to other feelings either because once you shut down one emotion you also shut down others. So she's been in this state for a lot of her life, shutting down whole groups of emotions. Now that she's started to allow herself to get into a state of emotional awareness, she's starting to feel some of these feelings that she's processing now. There are seven or eight steps of emotional awareness too.

Some of them we go through instantly and other ones take many months to achieve, depending on the levels of emotional resistance that we have to the experience of an emotion. This is why I say we probably need to have a discussion about that subject at some point. But for Katherine, she's started to go down into these areas of soul-based processing through some of the emotion. Now when you go into this phase of your processing of emotion, the real emotion, the hurt child's emotion in this case, because all of our fears are generally related to the hurt child's emotion, what happens is that there is an intensifying of the emotional experience. That's because you are now in allowance. Your allowance of your emotion is improving and therefore the emotional experience which you have up until now been suppressing, is now improving. In other words, you are now becoming more sensitive to the emotions that are inside of you, and of course if the emotion is fear, then that means that you'll become more sensitive to the feeling of intensifying fear.

You will start feeling it bodily; you will shake a lot. Stuff before that you weren't even doing at all, you are now exhibiting through your body if you're truly releasing, if you're releasing this causally-based emotion. During that phase it does sometime feel like it's intensifying. The reality though is that this level of fear has always been in you, but you've just not allowed yourself to experience it and you've used techniques, sometimes a lot of techniques, in order to suppress it. Some of these techniques include physical techniques such as using your movement, moving the your way out of emotion, busying yourself, working hard. Working hard has been a very big thing for Katherine. She's been using physical ways of avoiding the emotion.

She's also used emotional ways of avoiding emotions, in other words, substituting emotion for other emotion, blaming herself when she shouldn't be blaming herself, and things like that. She's used emotional techniques, she's sometimes resorted to substances like food, for example, to avoid the emotion. Most people have a long list of ways that they've used to suppress and deny emotion and then as they've deconstructed that, which I know Katherine has done over the last few years, you start becoming more sensitive to what's really there. For a lot of people what's actually there is a shock, the depth of the intensity of the emotion that's present. However, the emotion isn't actually intensifying, in the sense that that emotion has always been there inside of you. It's just that now you are allowing the experience of it.

And remember, energy becomes emotion once you experience it. So this emotion is now being allowed to be experienced and of course it has a feeling of intensifying. This is a phase that everyone will need to go through with regard to every type of emotion, not just with fear.

**Mary:** Sometimes it feels to me like a tensed muscle and it goes numb. You're holding, holding, holding; you lose awareness, really, of that.

You don't even feel it. You get to a point where you can't even feel the physical pain of it even though your body is obviously in physical pain, because when you start to release it ...

**Mary:** Well that is what I was going to say. As I seem to soften up more, my soul, suddenly there's more pain everywhere, and it's like there's a muscle that's been tense, and I've been holding on with my resistance to keep these emotions shut down and not moving. As soon as I soften them and they begin to move, the pain seems to intensify massively and it was always there, it was just that my will has changed. Where I was once holding it down, now it's moving and that gives me more sensitivity to it.

Of course, of course, and this is what people need to get used to. You see, what happens generally though, is people are not used to this. They start allowing the sensitivity to their emotion, then they start finding the emotion gets fairly powerful because for the first time they've actually allowed its true experience - because it was powerful as a child, extremely powerful as a child, but you were often powerfully suppressed as well. Of course we've learnt, and purposefully learnt many of us, techniques to suppress so that we don't have to bear that kind of pain. Because we have learnt all these techniques, we've powerfully suppressed these powerful emotions. Once you take away all of the suppression, and take away all of the resistance, the emotion starts to flow and as a result of it starting to flow it feels like it's intensifying. It's a phase we need to go through until we're at the stage where we're truly feeling the real experience, which will be very intense actually.

Very intense experiences are what cause us to heal. If we allow the experience of the locked-up intense experience, then we will have some healing effect from processing an emotion. This is a process that we go through. It's the opposite process to how the emotion was suppressed. If you think about it, we initially had the emotion and then heavy suppression instantly, and all sorts of techniques and everything, piled a whole heap of stuff on top of this emotion. What we've done is start to pull it all apart, and pull it all apart, wash it all down if you like, until we get down to the real problem. The problem is going to be a very smelly problem, because it's been festering in our soul for years and years and years. It's going to be quite intense to go through it, and you need to learn how to process through intense emotions. You need to learn how to do that safely, and you need to learn how to do that relying on God, and you need to learn how to do it for your own sake, so that you don't have to rely on anybody else to do it.

You need to learn how to do it without damaging yourself. You need to learn how to do it without damaging other people, and this is all part of your learning process actually, in terms of how you become your true emotional self.

**Mary:** Is it a part of understanding our soul really, and the will of our soul, and the nature of our soul?

Yes, it is, and also that we don't have to fear emotion. You see, most people have tremendous amounts of fear of emotion itself, and fear is what causes most of our pain. If you're not afraid of your emotion, it's very rare that a lot of pain will occur. You'll have emotional pain, of course, but you won't have as much, anywhere near as much, or any physical pain, once you're feeling your true causally-based emotions, the hurt child emotions. I feel she's going through a natural process, which she has begun, and I know Katherine and I know that she's also now accepting more truth. She's finding that more truth about her personal life is coming to her. She's found more and more out about the role her father and her mother played in her abuse, and as a result there is going to be a lot of fear to feel unfortunately. The key is to rely on God and trust the soul's process.

Just trust that soul of yours that God created. Trust that God created it to cope with anything and allow yourself to go through the experience. Your fear of the experience is going to cause pain. What happens for Katherine is that every time she gets afraid of the deepening emotional experience, she often tries to run away from the emotional experience, and that's what causes some physical pain, and also causes some spirits to over-cloak her in that moment and affect parts, or the organs of her body and so forth. That could all be avoided as long as she just allowed the process further.

**Mary:** Okay. I would like to ask you about something else I've observed. In this case we know Katherine. We know she has a fairly sincere will to look at herself, and to deal with her fear.

Yes.

**Mary:** But I have observed in other people, especially when it comes to the emotional release of fear, they begin to touch into their fear but their soul-based desire is not to experience fear, not to experience the truth about fear, and so they then attract a lot of spirits who are in a fearful state. The person doesn't want to be there themselves. They absent themselves and a lot of spirits get involved in... it can feel like a ramping up of fear, for that person.

Yes, but it's not really is it? It's a projection from these spirits towards them, of their own fear.

**Mary:** Yes.

The reality is that when we try to avoid our own fear we will receive these projections. In fact there are many, many spirits in the spirit world who have a complete desire for every person on earth to deny every fear, and they have a complete desire to help you deny every fear as well. That's a whole different discussion about spirit influence really and how it occurs.

**Mary:** Sure. Okay. So in that case we wouldn't see any relief.

No. There would be no relief, there would be no growing truth, there would be no growing awareness of the situation of what the cause is, there would be no connection to the childhood experience, the fear-based childhood experience. Katherine's had many fear-based childhood experiences that have been suppressed...

**Mary:**... that she's now opening up to and remembering.

... that she's now allowing herself to open up to, remember, and experience. This is a good indication that she's actually doing some true emotional work, whereas a person who is just getting over-cloaked by spirits isn't doing those kinds of things generally. Because they don't want to face their own fear, they're now experiencing the fear of other people. Of course if you don't want to feel your own fear, you will attract many people around you, both on earth and in the spirit world, who tell you, "Don't do it, don't do it, it's dangerous." You know, there are so many therapists who have been told, "Be very, very careful how you work through issues with a person on earth with regard to helping them because it can be very dangerous." It can be very dangerous, but only when the person is in desire to avoid, and of course most people who go to therapists usually have a feeling that they want the therapist to solve their problem.

They also generally have a feeling, as most therapists know, that they wish to avoid their own emotional experience and this is what causes the danger. If you truly absorb and allow your own emotional experiences, you will never be in any danger.

**Mary:** Great, thank you.

5. Is it my fault if I was abused?

Well, no, of course not, but I have to clarify some things here with this question. Firstly, as a child, it's never your fault that you're abused, ever, under any circumstances, no matter what abuse occurred, and no matter what the adults around you who abused you, told you. Even if the person who abused you was a child, it's still not your fault. Abuse occurs because somebody chose to be unloving to you. Somebody other than you chose to be unloving to you. That's why abuse occurs, as a child. Now where I need to clarify is what happens as an adult.

Now if as an adult we are getting abused, or we feel we are being abused, then yes, there are some things that we need to look at inside of ourselves that may be causing, or attracting, such abuse. When I say "causing or attracting such abuse," what I mean is that there are issues within us about love that we don't understand, where we are not being loving to ourselves at the soul level that are causing other people to believe that they can get away with abusing us. Unfortunately, because abuse occurs generally as a child, quite frequently in fact as a child, most of these children grow up to be adults who are still really children. The problem with that is that they still act like an abused child.

Because they act like an abused child, they don't believe they have any power to prevent abuse. Because they don't believe they have power to prevent abuse, and they haven't worked through the issues of self-love surrounding abuse, they often attract abuse as a result of their unwillingness to go through those groups of emotions. Now that's still not their fault. The fault of the abuse is always in the abuser, but we must see that if we are refusing to address childhood abusive issues, there is a high likelihood as an adult that we will still attract abusive adults.

The reason for that is, we are really still like an abused child who hasn't felt its feelings about it, so the adults who see us, don't see us as an adult who has self-awareness and the ability to prevent abuse and attack. They see us as a child still, because emotionally we still are, so they feel us as a child still, ready to accept abuse. This is why a lot of adult people who had abusive childhoods still get abused during their adult life, because the thing coming out of their soul is, "I'm still a child who has been abused," and so every adult around them who is sensitive to that goes, "Okay, I have an opportunity here."

These are the damaged and very unloving people who believe they are able to take these opportunities, and they are very evil in terms of their nature, because they are willing to hurt other people. They can scan whole groups of people and go, "That woman over there, even though she's thirty, was abused as a child, and I know I can get away with abusing her again. I know that if I abuse her she will probably blame herself," because she is oftentimes blaming herself from her childhood, and this is part of the problem. She needs to go through the emotions where she felt like it was her fault, where she was told it was her fault and so forth, and come out the other side of that and she will realise that none of it was her fault. None of it.

So while I'm making the initial comment, "No, no abuse is your fault, ever. Even if you're an adult or child, and you're being abused by other people, none of it is your fault. There is this qualifying thing we need to state, and that is that as an adult if we're still getting abused, then we've got to examine the reason why, because it is partly to do with what we've not let go of. It is because the people around us believe that they can abuse us still, even though we're an adult. You see, as a child they could get away with it.

Many of the abusers know it's quite easy to abuse a child. The child's not big, the child doesn't have much of a will to fight, you can manipulate and frighten a child quite easily. You can make a child believe things, particularly when it's in the early ages, under seven years of age. You can make a child believe things that later it would never accept as truth. The problem for the child that has been abused, is that the child grows to be an adult with all the distorted viewpoints of the child, because all of the emotions are still locked up inside of the child. Unless the adult survivor of abuse actually allows themselves to go through the emotions associated with abuse, they will still act like a child survivor of abuse, because the emotions are locking them up at the age (of the abuse).

This is a principle relating to the soul and how it functions. Every time you have a suppressed emotion, this suppressed emotion that is not allowed its full experience is locked up at the age that it was suppressed. If that age happens to be three, you will act like you're three when you're in the same situation. If the age was five, you will act like you're five when you're in the same situation. Unless you release the emotion you will continue to do that, and it will be a great struggle for you otherwise to try to fight that process. There are some very important things that we've said here, and I just need to go over them.

One - No, never is the abuse your fault. If you are being abused by someone else, it is never your fault, whether you're an adult or a child. It is the fault of the person who is choosing to abuse you. It is a choice that they are making for whatever reasons (and we can probably go into those reasons at another time), but they're making a choice to avoid all their own painful reasons, and all of their own unloving behaviour, and all of their evil actions, and they are choosing to abuse you, so it's not your fault, ever. However, if we are getting abused as an adult, then we need to look at the fact that we still really think of ourselves as a child. That means that we have quite a lot of childlike emotions locked up within us that we are refusing to feel and release. It would benefit us immensely if, either with the aid of a therapist or helper, or even by ourselves with God, we went through these emotions, the childlike emotions, and then come out the other side of them.

**Mary:** The reason you're making the distinction between the adult and the child in that situation, is that the adult now has the free will choice to actually experience more of that emotion than they perhaps did when they were a child, and abused.

Yes. They definitely have a lot more than that actually, not just the exercise of their free will. I suppose we need to qualify it. In the western world, every single adult is protected by law, generally. So we do have the opportunity to resist abuse, by law. Unfortunately, in other countries, some Third World countries, and less developed countries from a love perspective, that's not always the option. For example, if you were a woman living in the Middle East, sometimes abuse at the hands of men is almost a bit of a way of life. You accept certain forms of abuse, and the law does not protect you. Now under those circumstances there's little you can do aside from feeling about every event, and releasing every event that occurs.

Now if you release every event that occurred in your childhood, there would be far less likelihood that these events would occur as an adult. However if you don't release the events that occurred during your childhood, it's far more likely the events will continue as an adult, because the adults around you will see you as a child that they can still abuse. Even though you're in an adult body, they will still feel you as a child who can still be abused. Now in the western world - we're talking now about Europe, the Americas generally, Australia, and other countries that are a bit more developed – there are laws protecting every person, children and adults, against abuse. Under those circumstances, if abuse is still occurring to you and you're an adult, it's because of this primary thing that you need to address inside of yourself - that you are allowing abuse to occur. There is a reason why you do that, and it's because you still think of yourself as a child who has been abused.

**Mary:** So, you're saying the reason you're allowing it is that you have suppressed childhood experience?

Correct.

**Mary:** And how do you begin to dis-allow it?

By feeling and releasing the childhood experiences. You have to go through the emotions that you're resisting that were part of the childhood abusive experience. That's the only way you can protect yourself, really. For example, we often see many people who have been sexually abused as a child, get raped as an adult. The reason this occurs is that there's an openness inside of the soul of that person, through the abuse of the child, which has never been patched up, never been repaired through their experiencing of the emotions associated with it. Usually parents, or other people around them, don't allow them to experience those emotions. During their childhood they've got good reason to not experience a lot of these emotions, but now as an adult they've chosen to continue to suppress these emotions. Unfortunately that's going to attract abusive men who then think that they can get away with abusing the adult woman, or raping her, in other words.

It's not her fault that she's being raped because it's the abusive man's fault that she's raped, but there is this feeling that they feel from her, that they can get away with it. That's something she can patch up within herself.

**Mary:** So feeling those childhood events will alter the feeling coming from that person's soul, but no doubt would also cause her to start to make some different decisions.

Yes. As she releases some of these childhood feelings, she will start to feel like she has power, she has self-responsibility, she's not going to enter sexually dangerous situations anymore. See, children that have had sexual abuse for example, often, as adults, enter sexually dangerous situations, which then make them subject to further abuse. Once she has healed those particular childhood experiences, she wouldn't be attracted to those same situations anymore. She wouldn't be drawn to pandering to fear, to people who are angry, anymore. She wouldn't place herself in situations that could be potentially dangerous to her person, sexually or physically. As a result she would be far more protected, as a result of those particular things.

On top of that, because she doesn't have the underlying emotional reason inside of her, her spirit guides and spirit friends can also assist her protection now more, rather than her just going along with the normal adult way of things. For example, if a person's been abused in their childhood, and then they have friends in their adult life that say, "Let's go along to party," and the child, the hurt child is going, "Oh, I think this is a pretty dangerous party. There are people who are abusive here," if she stays "the child," she will stay there. But if she's an adult now she will go, "Oh okay, I'm noticing this is a dangerous place, and I need to walk out of here and just get going." It doesn't matter to her whether her friends stay or not. She would leave. This is where we make changes and as a result we are far more protected.

We can't assume that if we have been harmed, abused, as an adult, there isn't something we need to work on personally, because there is. Firstly we need to release the feelings associated with the abuse that occurred as an adult, but we also need to feel about the childhood experience that obviously caused the adult who is attacking us to potentially believe they can get away with that attack.

Now of course you can be completely at-one with God and still get abused. However your response to the abuse would be completely different. You'll no longer be saddened by it, or you won't feel a huge amount of pain about it. You won't feel like fighting it. You won't feel bad about yourself as a result of it, because you will be able to appropriate the responsibility for the abuse on the person who chose the act.

So you can't say that a person who is at-one with God will never be abused, but you can say that they will greatly lessen their chances of being abused, because there are no longer any emotions in them that relate to the inner child that's hurt. The people around them will no longer believe that they can get away with it as easily as maybe they would do otherwise.

There's a lot we could talk about on abuse. To be honest, I think when it comes to our discussions, our FAQ's about sexual matters, one of the sexual matters we will be discussing as part of that series of FAQ's is the subject of sexual abuse, and probably physical abuse and other forms of abuse at the same time, because similar things apply to all forms of abuse.

We can give more information about that then, but it's very important that a person does not feel that they are to blame for being abused. It's a very basic, fundamental truth. You are never to blame for being abused. Ever.

6. Does the degree of the desire to feel determine emotional release & growth?

**Mary:** The next question is from Miranda, and it's a little lengthy so I will read through it and then we can discuss it. She says, "I'm reading an excellent book called Healing Developmental Trauma: How Early Trauma Affects Self-Regulation, Self-Image, and the Capacity for Relationship. In Part Two, it talks about how the trauma of neglected basic developmental needs and abuse affect the brain, endocrine system, chemical balance, etc. It cautions therapists to take the patient slowly through their healing process, especially when there have been severe traumas and abuses.

**Mary:** From what I have read in a few similar books, John Bradshaw's Homecoming included, they seem to be missing a point between understanding how the soul damage is created, and the healing. With psychotherapy, it seems to take a long time and many sessions for people to become healed. From my experience when people's, mine included, causal emotions are truly released the Law of Attraction changed almost instantly, within twenty-four hours sometimes.

**Mary:** Would the chemical imbalance be corrected as rapidly as a result of this deep healing, or would that take time? As creating synapses, or grooves, in the brain usually happens over time. And if it is not happening instantly, how could the transformation still happen, with no relapse? In the case of a person who went through repentance, how lasting would the change be? I noticed that when repentance happened, the changes are much more profound. Is it safe to say that there's no need to concern ourselves with the chemical imbalance, and simply trust that a person will go where they need to go in their emotional processing, to the degree of their desire to feel?"

I feel this is a very good question Miranda, and as a therapist... she's a therapist I know so she's got quite a lot of background about therapy, and she's seen the positive benefit of applying the principles of how the human soul functions to her own therapy. I think we probably need to dissect this entire question, so let's do that.

**Mary:** Okay.

Firstly she talks about a whole series of books, some of which are well known, regarding the effect of trauma in your childhood, and how it affects the physical aspects of the regulation of your brain, your endocrine system, your chemical balance, and even your muscular and skeletal systems. And it does affect all of those things. So yes, all of this early childhood trauma does affect your entire body of course, because it affects your soul and your soul is connected to your body. Everywhere there is a blockage of some emotion, and usually inside of a person who has experienced trauma as a child, a lot of trauma in particular, and if it's been systematic trauma, e.g. sexual abuses, then of course there are going to be lots of different areas of blockages inside of the soul.

In other words, there's going to be energy locked up inside of the soul, in lots of different areas of the soul, which will then reflect in the spirit and the physical bodies, so you are going to have all aspects of your physical and spiritual bodies being affected. Because most of this trauma occurred during your developmental years, from the ages before seven years of age, it means that many of these are belief systems that are well-established in your memory, therefore also well-established inside of your brain in terms of how your brain works. All of these things of course are true. They are all true and they have been scientifically proven, I feel, at this point in time, to be true. The problem, where it all goes awry, is where we start attributing certain potential causes to these effects. This is where I feel the medical profession goes out of harmony with the development of scientific fact. We can only make statements of scientific fact, or we are just basically wandering around in the dark.

I feel a lot of times what happens with scientists and the medical profession - it (medical) is a scientific profession - is they measure a whole series of effects and then they postulate as to what the causes may be, rather than knowing what the causes are. Now once you start to understand how the human soul functions, you realise that everything that happens in the physical body is about the denial of something that is happening in your soul.

**Mary:** Everything negative or unhealthy that is happening in the body?

Everything! Everything, including negative belief systems; they are not the result of chemical imbalances in the brain. They cause chemical imbalances in the brain. The chemical imbalances in the brain are the effect of the soul-based locked up emotions, not the other way around. The soul-based locked up emotions cause physical problems in the body; they also cause physical problems in the spirit body. They cause problems with the flow of energy. Anybody who is used to any kind of Eastern, or Chinese type of medicine, would know that emotions they can see in the spirit body prevent the flow of energy in the material body. Therefore the material body gets affected by them, not only affected, but unfortunately harmed, by the locked up emotions. Now they also know, many people in Eastern medical professions know, that there is also the attraction of entities. They call them "entities," not spirits, people. They call them entities from what they call "other worlds," or whatever, but really they are just spirits who are attracted to these particular injuries, who also exacerbate the problem for the person who has gone through these particular traumas.

Many times these people have influenced the people on Earth. These spirits have influenced the people on Earth during the developmental years of their life. That of course also then means that they are greatly influencing the flow of energy in their body as well. So we have all of these combined issues of problems. Now, to then assume that we must go slowly, and be careful, and all of these other presumptions; there is now no scientific evidence for those presumptions. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence, because most people who have had trauma during their childhood experience have a lot of deep resistance to experiencing the emotion. Most people who experience childhood trauma want there to be a solution other than feeling their childhood trauma-based emotions.

They are already in a mode where they want to avoid the experience of these emotions. Since they want to avoid the experience of these emotions, they are often over-cloaked or influenced by spirits during the processing of these emotions. As a result, the therapist measures that avoidance through the psychotic, if you like, episode that the person who is going through the emotion might have experienced. The therapist becomes very concerned and therefore says, "We need to be very, very careful. We need to take it very slow." But that is without a complete understanding of what's going on. Unfortunately there are no scientific, or psychological journals on the planet today that actually know what is going on, in a holistic picture of what's going on, particularly for early developmental trauma, but for all forms of trauma actually.

Because we don't know, because nobody knows, they're all very frightened, and therefore they want to take a lot of very careful consideration. That of course means that there is a very slow process of recovery, if any recovery at all. Many of these people who have experienced childhood developmental trauma never recover their entire life, or they find their life difficult for most of their life, unfortunately. It doesn't have to be that way. But to not be that way, it requires understanding the soul. This is where I feel every single person who is doing therapy needs to understand how the human soul functions.

All of the way through these discussions about emotions, we've pointed people to How the Human Soul Functions. It is an essential piece of material for any therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, any person who is involved in therapy. Any life coach, all of those people involved in those industries need to examine how the human soul functions, if they're truly going to have a positive effect on a person.

Now Miranda then raises the issue of what happens in her experience. What she has found is actually true. That is that you don't have to concern yourself about going slowly at all. What you need to concern yourself with is the willingness of the patient to actually feel the emotion that occurred during their trauma. Most patients are unwilling when they begin. Now because they are unwilling when they begin, because they're afraid of their emotions, they're afraid of how traumatic these emotions are, and so forth, there is a high likelihood, particularly at the beginning, that if you take them through a process they are unwilling to follow, they will withdraw from the process, and during that time become over-cloaked by spirits who get involved in the process with them.

In other words, there's a higher likelihood of them reverting to psychosis, or psychotic behaviour, during that period of time. If the patient's completely willing emotionally to experience their emotions, there is no danger at all of that occurring. If they allow the emotional experience, as Miranda has found during her own therapist sessions with other people, they will release the causal emotion, and their life will instantly demonstrate the change. Now it's instant, even though most people will only observe it over twenty-four hours or forty-eight hours. It's actually an instant change that has occurred in the soul. Now from that moment on, any physical, or psychological, or intellectual impairment, that has occurred due to that emotion that has been locked up all of that person's life, during their life, any of that impairment related specifically to the emotion that has been released will also begin its recovery.

**Mary:** So it's not instantaneous, but it begins?

Well there are some systems in the body that are instantaneous, or relatively instantaneous, that will occur over the next few hours. Then there are other systems that take days. There are other systems that take weeks. Some take months, and some take up to seven years. It just depends on which system we're talking about, as to how long the recovery will actually take.

**Mary:** A clarifier - Miranda in her question poses that if this takes time, isn't there a danger of relapse? This is where she is viewing the physical body as the thing that is directing how the emotion flows?

Correct. This is because of a misunderstanding about the soul. Everything comes from the soul. There is no danger of a relapse unless the person imbibed the same emotion that they had, and the likelihood of them doing that is very highly unlikely, so it's highly unlikely they will relapse.

**Mary:** So when we release something causally, the change happens in our soul ...

Instantly.

**Mary:** Perhaps we should rewind and recap what you said. You said, "As a child, when there's trauma and that's suppressed, things are retained in the soul as energy locked up.

As energy locked up. They're not being felt as emotion, they're just energy locked up and not in motion.

**Mary:** Yes, and this affects the spirit body, and the physical body. The cause of any issue is in the soul and that's reflected in the spirit and physical bodies. These things that she's (Miranda) talking about, the endocrine system ...

The chemical imbalances in the brain, the synapses of the brain, the way you think. Even the way you think is completely changed.

**Mary:** The formation of your brain.

The formation of your cells, the damage done to each individual cell in different locations, the different problems you have in different parts of your body. All of these things are the result of the suppression of emotions from your childhood.

**Mary:** Yes, so they're the effect. They're not governing what happens to the emotion. They are the grooves, if you like, that are formed because of the soul's decision to deal with the emotion in a certain way.

Yes, and because they're not governing, because they are the effects, they have no governance over the recovery.

**Mary:** Yes. Once we recover the soul, then even though the grooves in the brain that she refers to, the functioning of the synapses, might still be a certain way, but because the soul has changed, this will gradually create the change in the brain. However, the brain is not going to dominate the soul.

No, and many parts of your body change very rapidly, usually within the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours. You will have a large benefit that you will feel within your body, usually within the first forty-eight hours. Then there are other systems within your body that take much, much longer to recover, take a longer time, and you will need to drink a lot of water, and do things to help your body do that of course, because there are a lot of toxins now that are going to come out of your body. A lot of your body's systems will begin operating correctly, and as a result they will start repairing this long-term problem.

Of course any long-term problem has a build-up of long term issues inside of the body that need to be repaired, and that repair process may take anywhere from hours to years, anywhere up to seven years, in fact, depending on what system you're talking about. Now all of what I said applies unless you've received Divine Love. When you receive Divine Love, particularly once you become at-one with God, all of the systems in your body are automatically in harmony with that love. This is how a person who is a healer who is at-one with God (there's no-one on Earth in that condition at the moment) - but a person who is a healer who is at-one with God, can instantly heal certain parts of the body once a person is willing to experience certain emotions associated with the injury in that part of the body.

**Mary:** So you are saying, whereas we might through our own will decide to feel those emotions, release them from the soul and there will be a gradual change in the physical body, when ...

When I say gradual, it may be gradual - from hours, right the way through to years.

**Mary:** Yes. When a person actually heals using Divine Love, then we must still be willing to release the emotion, and if we do, then the changes in the physical body are instantaneous?

Yes, because God's Love can be used as the healing mechanism of the systems affected by that particular emotion. So this is how I healed things in the first century. This is how anyone who becomes at-one with God can heal other people. Of course there needs to be a willingness inside of the person to address the underlying emotional issues. That's why we're spending this time on emotions - because we need to help people come to accept the importance of working through and addressing their emotions, in terms of somebody else coming along at some stage in the future and helping them be healed. There needs to be a willingness internally you see.

Her last statement I feel is the important statement, so maybe if you read that again...

**Mary:** "Is it safe to say that there's no need to concern ourselves with the chemical imbalance, and simply trust that a person will go where they need to go in their emotional processing, to the degree of their desire to feel?"

Correct. That is correct. The person will go where they need to go in their processing, directly proportional to their desire to feel. This is where therapists can help a person greatly. It's about attempting to help a person understand the way the soul works, and the way the physical and spiritual bodies are affected by the soul. This is a way, you could educate people, as a therapist, but also the primary education that needs to occur from the therapist to the patient is the education about their will, the exercise of their true desire to feel.

Many people, as I said right at the beginning of the answer to this question, many people who have had early childhood trauma, have very little desire to feel it. This is why so many damaging results occur when a person goes to a therapist, because they are actually in this lack of desire to feel it still. They want their life to be fixed without having to go through the feelings. They want some kind of chemical solution, medical solution, some therapist to wave their magic wand and come up with a solution, but they don't want to have to go through the emotional experience. This is the primary problem that causes things like psychotic behaviour, during the process of trying to help a person through traumatic memories. What I'm suggesting to people is: it's not good to push the patient into being willing to do something they are obviously not willing to do, but you can educate them about their willingness, and the need for them to develop a willingness inside of them. Will is like a muscle that needs to be exercised, as we'll talk about many times in the future. We need to help them see that they can develop their will, and grow their will to start to experience, and release, many of these emotions that they are now safe to experience, even though they weren't safe to experience them as a child.

Once you do that there is little danger, no danger at all in fact, of them ever being harmed by spirits or some psychotic episode, which is usually triggered by spirits in some way, through their therapy process. That means that people don't have to worry about how fast it goes. How fast it goes will be dependent completely upon the will of the patient. That's the way it should be, in fact. What we can do is help the patient have a developed will, so they want to go through it rather than looking for some magical solution to the problem.

7. What are the original causes of fears & terrors that dominate the planet?

Well, the answer to this question is quite simple really, in a lot of ways, and that is: fear is the direct result of us not understanding the truth. All of our terror, and all of the fear that now dominates the planet, is due to the fact that we don't know the truth about how the universe works and how everything runs. The main reason we don't know the truth is that we've accepted the lie. We believe that the lies are true. That's really what fear is. Fear is false... appearing real, so we've actually created an unreality, if you like, from God's perspective.

We've then called it "real," and then of course we're going to have lots of fears and terrors associated with it. Now this began through the process of Amon and Aman, the first human couple, deciding to make the first step into untruth. The first step into untruth was that we could be gods. In other words, we could be not just self-determining beings, which was what God created us to be, with free will, but rather god-like, or gods in that we could tell God what to do. We could create our own laws. This idea, or concept, was the first inception of a lot of lies, of a lot of errors, but with every error comes the penalty of the pain of the error. The pain of the error is always fear. There's always fear associated with the pain of any error.

This is the problem. Every time we deny truth, fear is automatically created on that particular subject. What's happened over many, many tens of thousands of years historically now, is that initially man created the monster error which was that we could be God, or we could be gods. That's the monster error.

There's only one God, there only ever will be one God, and there will only ever be one Creator of our entire universe. We're never going to be gods. We may become very god-like in our nature, personality and so forth, but in the end we will all be dependent on the laws that God's already constructed and created. The real God created these laws in the Universe so that anarchy couldn't exist.

What happened was that humankind stepped into anarchy, and in that process of stepping into anarchy, a lot of untruths began to be taught, the first untruth being that we can be God. That's a pretty monster untruth, and of course that then means that any other smaller untruth is much more easily accepted. What happened very rapidly historically is that this monster untruth, which was the beginning of all the untruths taught, began to be taught and encouraged, and each untruth begets another generally. Eventually each fear creates more untruths as well. The fear created by the previous untruth then has the problem of creating another untruth generally. This is the problem with fear, with lies. You have to lie more in order to maintain the reality you have now constructed.

The problem with this process is that it's been an ongoing process since the first human couple, and it very rapidly came into being as a result of the big monster untruth that was told first.

**Mary:** I love that, it being called "the big monster untruth." It's far more exciting than "the original sin."

It's the biggest untruth that affects humanity today, and it's the biggest untruth that affects our development of becoming at-one with God. It stops us from becoming at-one with God, so it's a monster untruth. This big untruth, the biggest one of all, then caused our ability to accept other untruths, which are smaller, but just as dangerous. As each untruth becomes accepted, becomes the lie appearing real, it's fear now. Every single fear now that occurs, is occurring because of all of these untruths that everyone believes to be true. Now that is the major cause of all world's untruth. All the world's problems with regard to fear and terror are caused by the fact that very few of us now know the truth, God's Truth, I'm talking about now.

If all of us knew God's Truth and we really felt it, because the only way to know God's Truth is in your heart, in your soul, and we really felt it, there would be no fear - at all. There would be no terror, at all. We would not experience terror. Even if someone tried to murder us we would not feel terror. Once we have all of these truths inside of our soul, we are not afraid of anything anymore. We would also be in a state of love with God. We would be receiving God's Love and we would be at-one with God in that location. As a result we would also know that we are loved, so the other error, the other untruth, "You are not worth anything," it would not be possible to enter us. We would not walk around as we do today, believing that we are to blame for a lot of things that we never did, and that other people are to blame for things that we did. Both of them come from the same primary cause. None of those things would be occurring either.

We need to start seeing that all of this fear and terror that's on the planet is the direct result of our acceptance of lies. Now once a person understands that, they become a lot more dedicated to finding out the truth, not only about universal truth but also the truth about themselves, because they understand that the problem associated with lies is that it causes all fear, causes all terror, causes all pain. Every time you imbibe lies, you are automatically going to create pain. Automatically. And you are automatically going to create suffering, and therefore you're automatically going to create fear and terror.

**Mary:** You said every time we "imbibe" lies, so every time we accept them as truths, as a false belief. What about every time we just allow them or accept them?

Well that's imbibing a lie too. Why would we ever allow a lie? It's only because we've already allowed another lie, which is, "You are not allowed to speak up about lies." Or we might have beliefs - "You tell the truth and it's painful." No, it's not painful. Lies are painful. We need to get these fundamental principles about God's Truth right. Lies are painful. Truth is never painful. Truth never causes pain. Ever. Truth exposes the pain you're already in because of the lies you accepted.

An example is a man who has cheated on his wife. He has, by not telling her the truth, caused her to accept a lie. It's the lie that's going to cause her pain. If he never cheated on her there would be no pain. He cheated on her, he lied to her, there are now going to be two pains. The fact that he cheated and also the fact that he lied. Both are untruth. Both are based on untruths. He did it for reasons that are not justifiable. Ever. He needs to work his way through whatever that is, but every time you choose to do these things and avoid the truth, you are causing error and pain. You're causing pain and suffering. You're causing terror on the planet.

This is why I keep saying to people who listen to Divine Truth, "Living in truth is the most important thing you can choose to do. Every time you withhold truth, every time you step away from it, every time you avoid it, every time you lie, every time you perpetrate another lie on this planet, you are going to cause pain to yourself. You're going to cause pain to others. You're going to create fear, and you're going to create terror. It doesn't matter what you did it for, and what reason you did it for, they are always going to be the results." That's what we need to see.

So this is the primary cause, and we need to see it as the primary cause if we're ever really going to become truthful ourselves, and if we're ever going to become healers to the planet, we need to understand that basic principle. That every time we lie, allow the lie, allow it to perpetrate, every time we lie to ourselves, every time we lie to others, every time we lie to God, every time we do all of these things, we are just perpetrating more fear, more terror, more problems, more pain, more suffering, and we've got to stop. We've got to stop even if we're only the first one who stops. Even if everybody attacks us, we've still got to stop, because without stopping we're never going to stop the continual cycle of this multi-generational fear and terror, which pervades society.

8. Why do we let fear run our personal lives & human society?

**Mary:** Fear is so destructive. (I don't even think I realise the extent of it yet!) Why do we let it run our personal lives, and also run what seems like the world?

Is that what somebody said?

**Mary:** Yes. This person's asking the question.

I think that hardly anybody on the planet realises it too.

**Mary:** How destructive it is? No. So the question really is - why do we let it run our personal lives and what seems like the entire world?

I don't know. (Laughs)

**Mary:** That was a quick question!

Well I do know, but yes, it makes no logical sense to let it run our lives, or run the entire world. It makes no logical sense at all. Of course unfortunately, a lot of what we do isn't logical, because it's driven by pain that we don't want to feel. The reason we allow it to run the world, and the reason we allow it to run our lives, is that we're unwilling to feel pain. We're unwilling to accept truth. As we talked about in one of the questions in this session, truth is the antidote to fear. Truth is what causes all fear to disappear. The reality is that if we are letting the world run by fear, and our own personal lives run by fear, it's because we have a very strong aversion to truth. We need to look at that.

We need to start examining that personally, and as a society. What we're doing frequently, is that we are accepting lies. We allow the perpetration of lies even though we don't believe them, and we like to create lies when it helps us avoid our own personal emotional pain. We've got to stop doing all of these things if we're ever going to have a fearless and a loving society. It's all about truth. It's all about the acceptance of truth. This is where I find people the most resistive. They are very resistive to personal truth, very resistive to personal truth, and many people in the world are violently resistive to external truth. Because we are so resistive to truth, fear and terror are the only results that are going to be created. Lies create fear and terror, not truth. Truth always exposes fear and terror. Truth always helps us be less afraid.

This is what we need to see in our lives. A lot of people want there to be another solution. They want the solution to not be truth. But it is truth. Once you come to know truth, it sets you free from almost everything, including fear and terror. If our life is governed by fear, and the world is governed by fear, it is because we are individually, and collectively, unable and unwilling to receive truth. We don't want truth and I see that as a big problem on the planet, the fact that we don't want truth.

**Mary:** You just said that we're unable to receive truth ...

Yes, because of our emotions. Inside of us we're going, "I don't want that truth. I don't want that truth. It's going to make me feel... it's going to expose some of the pain that I have inside of me, and I feel like I'm unable to feel it," and so I'm unable to receive it. I'm not saying we're unable in terms of our soul not being able. We are completely able to receive truth at any time. That's the way God designed us, but we create our own inability to receive it by avoiding our own pain. We don't want to experience our own pain and we finish up avoiding the truth. Then of course we complain about how much fear and terror our life's in, but it's all because we've avoided a whole heap of truth. When you accept truth it's a lot easier. People have no idea how easy your life is once you start really accepting truth and really loving the truth.

All of these fear-based responses are the result of us avoiding truth, so I feel again, the biggest issue about fear is our refusal to accept truth, whether that be universal truth or personal truth. For the majority of us, we're a bit more open to universal truth than we are to personal truth, although I've seen many people react violently, to the point where they are willing to go to war, for either - to hold on to a universal error, or to hold on to a personal error. They are willing to go to war, and many, many people have died, historically, as a result of people wanting to hold on to those two things. It's so sad that this is the case.

**Mary:** So that desire to hold on to those errors, it's a fear of receiving truth about those same things?

It's not only a fear of receiving the truth, it's a direct desire to avoid receiving the truth. Now of course that's driven by fear, but it's also driven by things like anger, and other emotions so perhaps it's not quite as simple as just being related to fear, but our avoidance of truth is the creator of all of the pain, and unfortunately we think that when we receive truth we're actually feeling more pain. No. The pain that we're already in is being exposed to us. That's how we need to see things if we're ever going to change anything on this planet. It mirrors some parts of the Spirit World. There are parts of the Spirit World where only truth exists. Nobody lies. Nobody tells an untruth. Nobody fabricates anything. Nobody's in a facade. In the First Sphere of the Celestial kingdom, that's what it's like.

There are places in the Spirit World where of course, there's no fear because there's no way for fear to exist, because nobody believes any lies. Everyone wants to accept the truth. Everyone loves the truth. Everyone upholds it. Everyone honours it. Everyone values it. Everyone sees how great it is. Everyone understands it sets you free. Everyone understands it helps you experience yourself, and your will, and your partner, and God. So none of them in those locations want to avoid it. When we want to avoid it, all we're doing is perpetrating more fear, and more terror on the planet, and in our personal lives. That's all we're doing when we're avoiding it. This is where I sometimes feel quite sad when I feel audiences, or groups of people that we're speaking to, avoiding the truth of their personal life, or avoiding a universal truth.

You know, you say you want to be a leader of reducing the fear on the planet. You say you want to be a leader of love on the planet. But what you're demonstrating to me is that the only way fear can disappear is by you accepting some truth, and you don't want to accept it. It's very sad when I see groups of people doing that, because it's proof that they do not understand the reason why fear and terror exists. If you don't understand the reason why it exists, you're never going to get rid of it.

The only way to get rid of it is to delete what we created, to destroy what we created. God didn't create it, so God can't destroy it. We created it. Historically, and personally, we create this terror and fear inside of ourselves, and we create it by accepting, and imbibing, and keeping false beliefs that we don't want to let go of. These false beliefs are all emotional. They all come from the emotional parts of our soul, and what we've decided to do is avoid the experience of them and leave them in there.

When we do that there is no hope for us to become leaders in love or leaders in truth, under those circumstances. We've got to have some courage, and face up to the truth, and realise that the true cause of the majority, if not all, of our problems here is the monster lies that we've been told. It's time that we started destroying them and getting rid of them.

There are monster lies religiously, monster lies about God. The biggest monster lie is about ourselves, like we can be gods. That's one of the biggest monster lies, but there are lies about God. There are lies about ourselves. There are lies about science. There are lies about religion. There are lies about emotions. There are lies about relationships. There are lies about parents, about children. Pretty much everything you can consider on the planet, there's a lie about it somewhere. This is why we have so much of this pain and suffering, which is a direct result of the fear and terror that we are in, as a result of trying to avoid the truth.

**Mary:** So holding on to the lies is creating the fear that we then let run our lives.

Yes. We need to understand that that's the reason. There's no other reason. There's no magical solution other than us destroying the lies we created. When I say "us," I mean humanity collectively destroying the lies we created.
