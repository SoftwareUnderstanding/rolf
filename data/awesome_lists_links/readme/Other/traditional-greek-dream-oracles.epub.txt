Chapter One: Preface

Beliefs about dreams and their interpretation differ from place to place and from time to time, according to the people's living conditions: some live on the mountains, others by the sea; some live in villages, others in urban centers; some are wealthy, others are poor -and so on; fortunate people tend to see bright, pleasant dreams, while the unfortunate ones often see confusing or ugly dreams.

In general, those who live a natural life -away from urban centers which are full of environmental and electromagnetic pollution- are in closer contact not only with their subconscious but with the astral plains as well. They tend to remember their dreams better and they manage to interpret them better too. That's why people of past generations, who lived simpler lives in a unpolluted environment, knew how to explain their dreams accurately and correctly.

I hereby mention some widespread beliefs regarding dream interpretation:

Friday dreams come true, sooner or later.

Sunday dreams come true till noon.

When the trees are in blossom (that is in spring), dreams can't be explained.

Light sleepers often see prophetic dreams.

Certain dreams have exactly the opposite meaning: For example, if you dream of being dead, you are likely to reach a very old age.

Lucid dreams (when you know you are dreaming) indicate a higher level of energy and awareness; these dreams are not symbolic, but sometimes they are prophetic.

Here are also some tips for a good night sleep:

Avoid fatty, saucy, spicy, or fried food at night.

Abstain from alcohol as much as possible, because it stays in the bloodstream for 24 hours and it's likely to give you confusing dreams or nightmares.

Smoking and drugs can do the same, or even worse.

Too much TV deteriorates the quality of dreams: You had better not watch TV more than two hours per day, and no later than 11:00 at night.

Computers and Internet can do even more harm; it is advisable not to work on your computer after 6:00 o' clock in the afternoon.

In general, all electronic devices equipped with a screen (such as computers, TVs, mobile phones) affect the nervous system and cause insomnia or bad dreams.

The following dream oracles are the result of many years of personal research: I have taken into account the interpretations given to me by my grandmother, who knew how to interpret dreams correctly, as well as those given to me by many people of her generation. Moreover, recording my own dreams -as well as those of others- for decades, has always proved the truth of the oracles included in this dream-book.

Chapter A

**Abacus:** If you dream of making calculations by use of an abacus, you will succeed in your business but only if you are very careful and hard working.

**Abuse:** If you dream of being abused or insulted, you will quarrel with a colleague at work. Especially to a woman, this dream means that she must be very careful, otherwise she will get a bad reputation. Anyway, watch your behaviour, be polite and keep your temper under any circumstances.
