I have searched a man with a candle during the day like Diogenes, the cynic, and I found Him in Heaven, and His Name is Jesus Christ.

God, bless you all, my brothers.

###  JESUS TESTIMONY

8 May 2005

The Passover of both orthodox and catholic Christians.

It was night and I was in my bed,

I repented for all my sins

and sincerely said to God that I forgive all that ever sinned against me

from the beginning of my creation, from all my past lives and from the present life . I had this very important thought:

GOD DEFENDED THE VICTIMS FROM THE BEGINNING.

It was the solution to the problem of evil, a problem from that I was obsessed for years.

And I saw a star descending from Heaven into my room, I felt a divine presence , and I knew it was Jesus Christ .

Through me started to progressively flow a river of Holy Divine

Love, and I knew the source of the river of love was an infinite ocean, and I became the Infinite Ocean of Holy, Pure Infinite Love.

And God loves every one of us with the same Infinite Holy Love, but the humankind has its heart closed in arrogance.

I thought: I do not deserve so much love, I am a sinner.

And God said to me: I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN.

Jesus made me as I was at the beginning.

Jesus made me like the ones from the beginning, He gave me back my lost divine soul.

***

In a dream, God revealed Himself to me:

He was crucified in a perfect blue sky,

His skin was like a combination of the color of all the races in the world, but a little dehydrated like a dehydrated apple.

He was full of Holy Infinite love.

He had a wound at a foot, an open wound, and He loved me also through that wound. He had a slight smile for me, from the Cross.

He was not at all sad or in suffering as a human would be.

The Holy Infinite Love that He has for us, actually dilutes the pain of the Cross. His eyes were big, of infinite Holy beauty a mix

of blue and green.

His Face was emanating power and goodness.

His Face didn't showed any sign of pain, only Holy Love.

And He said to me, with a slight smile:

I AM CRUCIFIED FOR YOUR EVERY MISTAKE!

I KNEW THAT HE WAS THE CREATOR SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSE.

###  Thoughts of Light

"If the world hates you, just remember it has hated Me first." God, The Holy Bible.

***  
Whoever denies the reason, that proves the existence of God, denies his own sins.  
***  
Whoever despises the moral of forgiveness, will be saturated by the justice.  
***  
The Holy Infinite Love of God, is our Judge and Savior, in the same time. Be Holy!  
***  
Whoever despises the law or the word of God, will become a slave of the law or the lies of the jungle.  
***  
Heaven means eternal gratitude.  
If you will sincerely thank God for every sunshine of every morning, you will be every morning in Paradise.  
For the Paradise is like an eternal calm full of peaceful light, morning.  
***  
The difference between heaven and hell is just a thought.  
***  
Only small people cannot forgive small mistakes.  
***  
A House divided cannot stand.  
***  
The vessel doesn't go often to the water,  
But the vessel of God goes as many times as he wants to the water.  
***  
Don't be naïve, the beautiful words can hide dark thoughts, but the beautiful thoughts give beautiful feelings.  
***  
The people are like stained glass.  
There are some that are completely dark and the light do not cross them or do not enter them.  
There are ones that are dirty and the light that cross them gets out dirty also.  
And there are those who have beautiful colors and the light that cross them is very beautiful.  
And there are those who are completely transparent, sincere in front of God, and the light that cross them is perfect like the light that entered them.  
Jesus reflected exactly the light of God and His words are exactly the words of God.  
Be not deceived by the dirty minds, that taint the TRUTH.  
***  
"Christianity is a religion too noble, for a being so ignoble as the man."  
Soren Kierkegaard  
***  
AT THE BEGINNING, WE WERE CREATED AFTER THE IMAGE OF GOD .

BUT THE HUMANITY DESECRATED THE IMAGE OF GOD, THAT LIVED AND STILL LIVES IN US, AND

THE TRUE IMAGE OF THE ONE TRUE GOD IS JESUS CHRIST.  
***  
WHO DESPISES THE MORAL OF FORGIVENESS WILL BE SATURATED BY THE JUSTICE  
***  
"This world will pass, but my words will never pass." Jesus Christ.

***

God loves you,

But you are a prodigal son, Return Home,  
God misses you.

This book will show you the way Home, into the Light of God: Jesus Christ the Truth, The Life and the Path.

***  
The men swim in an ocean of sweet water, and they say that they die of thirst, because they were lied that the water is salty, and they fear to drink it.

Fear not, because GOD IS LOVE.

***

THE SKY IS THE SAME OVER ALL.  
***  
THE SKY IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE AND OVER ALL.  
ABOVE THE CLOUDS OF OUR DARK THOUGHTS THE SKY IS ALWAYS BLUE.

***  
The root of evil it is in the spiritual mediocrity!  
Because the sin produces the self-deception that fuels our pathological ego.  
***  
Whoever despises the law of God will become a slave of the law of the jungle.  
***  
To be saved you must not have the faith of the old ladies, but the faith of angels!

***  
I must stay above the clouds,

in the highest,  
were the sky is always blue, and were all they say is true. Glory to God in the Highest!

In this way I will be above the clouds, in the perfect blue sky.  
With the feet on the ground and the spirit in the sky.

***  
When the evil becomes banality, we believe that is innocent. It is not innocent, just mediocre.  
***  
The love of God,

The majority cannot feel it because they are just flowers who are too young, or they are to old...already dead spiritually.  
***  
The greatest sin is to think you have no sin.

***  
The light is powerful, but the men are blind.  
***  
A mad man can watch the sun, through a filthy glass and believe that his rays are dirty, and only another mad man will believe him.

This madness it is a sin against the Holy Spirit, and the present state of the collective consciousness of humanity.

We must cleanse our collective consciousness.  
***  
The man's fission from God it is more dangerous and with greater consequences than the fission of matter.

When the soul leaves The Holy Spirit, not only it loses the happiness and the spiritual sight , but also the protection of the Spirit of the Truth .

And the Holy Spirit will not tolerate to be offended.  
Don't find excuses , they are not accepted in front of the Spirit of the Truth .  
***  
God loves the Human Species.  
When God descended on this prison planet, the inmates crucified Him, and He proved the infinite love that He has for this decayed humanity.  
***  
We make the great voyages with small steps.  
***  
Jesus always begins His prayers by thanking God.  
***  
God is love, and you can understand Him only through true love, and this cannot be taught in a book by words, it is a choice you make with your heart.  
***  
The Cross it is the ultimate evidence of the love of God for the humankind.

The men crucify God daily in their minds, by misjudging Him, and this is for God equally painful as the pain of the physical Cross, from 2000 years ago.  
***  
The justice , the forgiveness, the mercy and the love of God do not contradict themselves. We are forgiven, if we forgive.

We receive mercy if we are merciful.

And we must be holy , to receive the Holy infinite love of God.

***

"We should obey God rather than man" Acts 5:29.

***  
I have no fear because God is with me , and I am not against Him.

***  
God loves the humankind !

Be humane!

***

"Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer." 1 John 3:15.

***  
"God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all." 1John 1:5.

***  
"Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever." Apostle Paul ( Hebrews 13:8)  
***

"The light shines into the darkness, and the darkness never put it out." John 1:5

***

"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth it is not in us " 1 John 1:8  
***  
"If we say we haven't sinned, we make God a liar ,and His word it is not in us ." 1 John 1:10.

***  
"Only God is good." Jesus Christ

***

The Human Species wakes up only to dream a nightmare that it likes.  
The Humankind believes it is morally superior to God because:  
1 .Falsely believes it is a victim of God .  
2. Disrespects Jesus , who reflected exactly the moral of God , which is the forgiveness. And this false believe it is a sin against the Spirit of the Truth.

***

Whoever despises the moral of forgiveness will be saturated by the justice.

***  
The difference between heaven and hell it is simply the degree of respect that we have for God. Every thought has attached a feeling.

It is not our feelings that determines our thoughts, but our thoughts that determine our feelings.

The feelings just follow the thoughts. God cannot be lied to.

All of us who are unhappy, sad and depressed, are simply full of dark thoughts, and the dark feelings follow.  
***

-If you have a son who made a crime and he must go to prison, you will stop loving your son?  
-No, you will probably love him more.

-But, you know that he deserves the prison, and you will do anything to liberate him. God does everything to liberate us.  
God will forgive us if we forgive also our brothers.

Because He loves us all with the same infinite love, He loved our victim with the same love He loves us, and He protected the true victims from the beginning.  
***

Any lie that makes you doubt the love of God is more dangerous than the atomic bomb if you believe it .  
***  
"I tell the Truth ,that's why you do not believe me " Jesus Christ

***  
God loves us.

In the same way, somebody despised your love, in the same way you despise the love of God.

***  
You cannot be happy because you are naïve, to trust this world and to distrust God.

***  
The truth will make us free because the lies made us slaves.  
***

The philosophical problem of evil tormented me for years.

I was obsessed by this problem.

And I solved it, the solution is:

The victims from today are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the beginning were defended by God, even if yesterday the aggressors were in other bodies , in other lives .

The demonstration of existence of reincarnation:

The premise: GOD IS JUST  
Conclusion: we all deserve our fate: we pay for sins from past lives.

***

Let's assume that a serial killer makes a stroke and forgets all that he has done, even believes that he is as innocent as a child.

Let's assume that nobody knew he was a murderer ,and that he succeeded before the stroke to hide his traces.  
Then he is hospitalized in a top university clinic where is treated by the most famous professors in neurology.

In the day of divine justice, the murderer and the professors believed that he suffered unjustly, that the destiny was unjust with the poor man.  
They all are guilty of the sin of unbelief and they are out of paradise.  
But the serial killer will suffer more than the professors.

But the disbelief of the teachers will not go unpunished also, because you see : he was a murderer and he must be punished.  
In the same way with this prison planet.  
Some of them are murderers and suffer greatly, some of them are unbelievers and suffer less, but they all suffer: because they offend The God of Love , assuming that He is unjust. And everyone deserves their karma and the victims from the beginning were defended by God.

But why the professors, men and women with deep minds who understood the complexity of the brain could not understand the goodness, the justice and the love of God ?

Simply , I answer: because of the very high image of themselves that they had , because they too had made mistakes.

Because whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.  
So it is with the ones who want to forget that they are born again, some for life some for death.

Because GOD IS JUST, we deserve our pain, and we pay sins from past lives. This explains why some of us are born to suffer, actually they are born to pay because in another life they made another person suffer.

The victims from today are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the Beginning were defended by God.

***  
The unfaithfulness is a sin against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of Science.

***  
We sin because of our mediocrity in good deeds , the self-deception witch follows the sin , builds a pathological arrogance .  
***  
Who doesn't respect the truth, respects not God.  
***  
Divide not, and be not divided against God!  
***  
When the evil becomes banality we believe that is innocent. It is not innocent, just mediocre.  
***

The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom

The love of God it is the completeness of wisdom.  
***  
God loves you, but you are an adulterous soul , that left the Spirit of the Truth for an arrogant illusion.  
***  
God loves you but you are to Him unfaithful.  
***

Divide not, and be not divided against God!

***  
We live in the light, but we close our eyes because we do not want to see our mistakes.

***

Our thoughts will save us,  
in the same way our thoughts destroyed us.  
***  
The absolute power is the Power of Light of Jesus Christ.

***

Do not beg from beggars.

***

"What is the Truth ?" Pilate ( John 18:38)  
"The truth is the Word Of God." Jesus Christ ( John 17:17)

***  
Has no importance what you believe about me, but what we believe about God , and this is our judgement.  
***  
God is with me and I am not against Him.  
***  
If you are politically correct, you are a slave of this world.

If you are divinely correct, you shall become a Son of God.  
***  
The human species became post-human, despising the love the truth and the path of God.

***  
When the arrogance is greater the will to see, only God can save thee.

***  
We shall never forget that the priests (Pharisees) and intellectuals

(scribes) crucified God, and they still do, in the spirit.

***

It is strange how we can thank a stranger for a cup of coffee, But we cannot thank God for the vessel of life.

***  
If you have an infected foot, the head cannot say: " I do not care , I am fine."

The head must treat the foot so the whole body will survive.

So, it is with the Humankind: we must be merciful.  
***  
The best defense it is not the offense, but the forgiveness.

***

I prefer to be criticized by God , rather than to be loved by man.

***  
If you love God with all your mind you will enter in Paradise.  
Avoid not the hard questions!  
By this will know the truthful answers : the Truth never blasphemes God.  
***  
I prefer to think that the whole world is wrong, and God is right.  
***  
God is with me, and I am not against Him. I will always be God's Advocate.  
***  
Before asking anything from God we must begin by thanking for what we already have, a free immortal consciousness.

***  
The art of true living it is the art of true , sincere, holy love. "Be holy as God is Holy."(1Peter 1:16).

***  
Beware of the love of men , because the men do not know how to love , and when they love , they love towards death .

Search instead the love of God , because the love of God is the eternal life.

***  
We shall learn the science of God, and to scientifically understand God we must use or minds and our hearts also.  
***  
The Holy Infinite Love of God is our Judge and Savior in the same time. Be Holy !  
***  
The vessel goes not often to the water

But the vessel of God goes how many times he wants to the water .

***

"The wisdom is proved right by all her children ." Jesus Christ

***  
Return to your first love : The Spirit of the Truth.  
***

The truth is the delight of angels and the pain of men.

***  
Who loves forgives,  
Who loves not, forgives not.

And who forgives will be forgiven by God.

Buddha never said that, Buddha just said that we must pretend that the pain doesn't exist. It exists and it is a proof and a fuel of our arrogance.

***

The sky is the same everywhere.  
God is the same everywhere and for everybody.  
***  
Any lie that makes you doubt the love of God , offends the Holy Spirit . This lie is more dangerous than the atomic bomb if you believe it .

***  
"If a blind leads a blind , they will all fall into Abyss." Jesus Christ .

***  
Whoever denies the existence of God, denies his own sins.  
***  
The humanity it is not our weakness but our power !

***  
"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." Lord's

Prayer

GOD SAID WE MUST FORGIVE TO BE FORGIVEN WE MUST BE MERCIFUL TO RECEIVE MERCY The majority IGNORE THIS TRUTH.

***  
God loves the Human Species but the Human Species is to Him unfaithful.

***  
But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me," declares the LORD ,Jeremiah 3:20

***  
"I send you to testify about me, to open their eyes and to bring them from darkness to light..." Jesus to Paul. (Acts 26:18)  
***  
The beautiful words can hide dark thoughts

But the beautiful thoughts give beautiful feelings. By their fruits you shall know the trees.

***  
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,

the love of God it is the completeness of wisdom.

***  
The definition the holiness : sincerity.

The definition of deceitfulness: perversity.  
***  
Our distrust in God's Love offends Him more that some sins we have committed. ***

The difference between heaven and hell is just a thought.

The thoughts will save us , because the thoughts also killed us.

***  
God loves you .

God defended the victims from the beginning.  
***  
The ones who cannot understand the love of God prove that they have never really loved, anybody.

***  
"For the ones that are clean , everything is clean

But for the ones that are dirty everything is dirty , even their minds, their thoughts . "Apostle Paul (Titus 1:15)

***  
IT IS OK TO QUESTION THE UNIVERSE.

It is not ok to believe in blasphemous answers.

By this you shall know the Truth: the Truth never blasphemes God !  
***  
THINKING IT IS NOT ONLY ALOUD  
BY MANDATORY TO FIND THE LIGHT AND TO STAY IN THE LIGHT. The sleep of reason produces monsters.

***  
The sword of the warrior of light it is the word of GOD.  
***  
God Never left Jesus ,  
We are the ones who left Jesus and God.  
***  
The love of God, it is like the sunshine:  
The majority cannot feel it because they are just flowers who are too young, Or they are to old...already dead spiritually.

***  
We shall never forget that priests and the intellectuals crucified God, and they still do.

***

Our Father from Heaven,  
Respected be your Holy Name,  
As it is in the Highest, so here on this prison planet, Our everyday thoughts, give them to us,  
And forgive us in the same way we forgive

And protect us from evil.  
AMEN.  
***  
I have to stay above the clouds, in the highest , were the sky is always blue, and were all they say is true.

***  
The sky is the same everywhere and for everybody!

***  
We prove that we love God if we receive His Holy Love.

***  
We are living in the light , but we have our eyes closed.

***  
The most important pray is Thanksgiving.  
***  
To know God you must first know yourself .

***  
HAS NO IMPORTANCE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME,

BUT IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE WHAT WE THINK ABOUT GOD. AND THIS IS OUR JUDGEMENT

***  
The root of evil is the mediocrity.

The Nostalgia of sin , felt sometime by the angels and always by the mediocrity.

The sin is followed and preceded by the pathological arrogance of darkness, which hides the mediocrity.  
***  
A blind man has the liberty to deny the existence of the Sun, but the blind man exists because of the Sun.

God's Advocate.  
***  
To defeat reality we must have a Real Faith, not an hypocrite one.

Because God separated from the beginning the light from the darkness. The Truth from the lie.

***

There are thoughts that kill and thoughts of light that bring life. The thoughts of God are life and light and there were untainted spoken trough Jesus Christ.

***  
God is more real that we are.  
***  
The Truth is that God is love, and the love of God is our judge. And if the infinite love of God decided not to protect some of us in the day of the judgement, how big can be their sins?  
An Abyss of sins...  
Be good my brothers!  
***  
Trial and error.  
If we do not recognize our errors we shall forever fail.

The key to success is to see and correct our errors.  
***  
All those who despise the moral of forgiveness will be saturated by the justice!

***

How morally superior the Human Species thinks it is to ...God... Because it despises the Moral of Christ and believes it is a victim of God.  
***  
We shall never forget that priests (Pharisees) and the intellectuals (scribes) crucified God.

The most dangerous soul in hell is the one who believes he is an angel, who has forgotten he has fallen .

And this spirit is the spirit of man.

***

The man's fission from God it is more dangerous and with greater consequences than the fission of matter .

When the soul leaves The Holy Spirit , not only loses the happiness and the spiritual sight , but also the protection of the Spirit of the Truth .

And the Holy Spirit will not tolerate to be offended .  
Don't find excuses , they are not accepted in front of the Spirit of the Truth . The Spirit of the Truth defends not the Spirits of Deceit.  
God opposes deception,  
and all that are born of Him and love the light oppose deception also.

GOD IS LIGHT.  
DEUS EST LUX.  
***  
We are living in the light , but we have our eyes closed.  
In a world of blind men, can be empirical considered that the light doesn't exist.  
But I know it exists, and what the light showed me is the true face of man and God. The man is full of darkness, and we should beware of darkness because it hides beasts. And God is light, and His face is Jesus Christ.

***  
I found Jesus because I made a sacrifice, I sacrificed myself.

***  
The definition of Naivety: to trust the love of men and to distrust the love of God.

The Naivety it is a Sin Against the Spirit of Truth, and it has the same root as the self- deception.  
God and His Holy Angels, oppose deception and self-deception.

***

Only the small people cannot forgive small mistakes.

***

I am not Naïve to Believe in the Love of God but I would be very naïve to believe in the love of men.

***  
The great journeys are made with small steps, to the highest mountain or the deepest valley.  
See reversed Milgram's Paradigm to teach your children to be good men.  
***  
You cannot crucify and worship God in the same time.  
***  
"But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions." Mark 11:26

The victims from today are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the beginning were defended by God.  
God loves us because we were born, and we were all born of Him.

And the Love of God is our Judge.

***  
God loves you,  
Be not an unfaithful soul.

***  
Lord my God,  
I thank you for the rays of light of this day

***  
Receive the Spirit of the Truth! Said Jesus to His disciples. That means that the Human Species has the liberty not to receive the Spirit of The truth. It is call self-deception and it is more common that you think.  
***  
YOU WERE WITH ME FROM THE BEGINNING.  
***  
I give up the darkness,  
but you give your tears to the night...  
***

"Jesus told him: Do not be afraid, just believe.'" Mark 5:36

***  
I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE GOD IS WITH ME, AND I AM NOT AGAINST HIM.

***

Every sin is a blasphemy because it despises the moral of God.

***  
The good thief is the key to the return to Paradise.

He said:  
For us is just!  
But it is unjust to crucify God.

***  
God loves the humankind, but the humankind loves the darkness rather than the light.

The humankind swims in an ocean of fresh water and it complains that dies of thirst. The humankind looks at the Sun through a stained glass and says that its rays are dirty, but its eyes are dirty with bad thoughts towards God.  
Or closes its eyes and says that the Sun doesn't exist, but it exists because of the Sun.

The humankind likes in a perverted way to believe that God hates her , in order to believe it is morally superior to Him and His angels.  
This illusion feeds a pathological arrogance , for what the humankind has left the happiness of the paradise .

And the paradise means to really know that God loves you, and this I am trying to teach you.  
***

The love of God is Just.

And I just need the love of God.

***

When we blame others for our mistakes, we give them our power.

***  
You must forgive to be forgiven, You must love to receive God's love.

***  
We function by the algorithm of trial and error.  
If we do not recognize our errors we will forever fail. Be smart, and see your errors

***  
Maranatha (Aramaic):Come Lord Jesus, come.  
1 Cor.16:22

***  
I LOVE YOU ALL WITH THE LOVE OF CHRIST!  
And the love of God, which is in Christ and in me, through the Holy Spirit, is our judge

and savior in the same time.

***

But you say: What is to forgive, we are good.  
In what darkness do you live; I pity you...  
When the arrogance is greater than the will to see, only God can save thee.

***

In reality the darkness fears the light .

***  
Do not name unclean what God cleansed.

***

Do not be naïve because:

The beautiful words can hide dark thoughts but the beautiful thoughts give beautiful feelings.

The Holy Spirit inspired me, because I despised the perversity of the lie.

***  
A real tragedy would be , to be in a prison and to believe that you are free.

***  
THANK YOU GOD FOR ALL!

AND ABOVE ALL, THANK YOU!

***  
The thoughts will saves us, in the same way the thoughts killed us. ***

The Thoughts of Light are thoughts of God .  
We think 30 000 thoughts daily.  
The quality of our thoughts determines the quality of our life.  
***  
Food it is not love and the sex is not love also.  
***  
-What is the truth?  
-The truth is the word of God  
And the truth will make us free and clean.  
***  
"Be merciful, as our Father from Heaven merciful is." Jesus Christ

Can a blind lead a blind?  
Will not fall both into the abyss?  
***  
"A city which sits on a mountain cannot be hidden."  
***  
"HAVE NO FEAR, just believe!"  
That God it is an infinite ocean of holy love.  
***  
-IT IS THE HOLY LOVE OF GOD THAT JUDGES US.  
And if the love of God has found some of us guilty and decided not to protect them in the day of the justice How big must their sins ...  
An Abyss of sins ...  
***  
Jesus is the light of the world  
But this world loves the darkness rather than the light.  
Because its deeds are evil, and it does not want to see its true face ...

***  
The power of light it is much stronger than the power of darkness.  
***  
It is not important to be rich, but it is very important not to be poor.  
***  
Who cannot understand the love of God, proves the he never really loved, anybody.

***  
Deceive not yourselves  
God cannot be lied to ...  
***  
Who does not respect the truth, respects not God, because God is the Truth.  
***  
It is the love of God that judge us  
***  
CONSIDER NOT UNCLEAN, WHAT GOD MADE CLEAN, WITH HIS BLOOD.

***  
The love of God is our judge .  
We have the Karma we deserve.  
***  
God is Human .  
This Species became post human.  
***

***  
I know that God exists.  
***

The fear of God it is a mistake , because we only fear the ones who we distrust.  
For example , God gave me a lesson of life to understand this better:  
I am an anesthesiologist, and I see all the time the deep fear that the poor patients have before the induction of anesthesia. If they do not have anxiolytics, most them are terrified. Of course not all of them say it, but I can empathize with them. And I say to them to have no fear , and to trust the team of anesthesia.  
I know deep down that if they really would have trusted me , they wouldn't have had fear, and consequently their fear offends me. This lesson it is very important to me to understand that my fear of God offends Him, it offends His Love.  
Because in front of God we are really powerless , and the fact that He tolerates our arrogance it is a very real proof that He really loves us.  
TRUST IN GOD !  
The Holy Spirit has taught me that the root of the fear of God is in the arrogance of the illusion of being morally superior towards God, of believing that we are victims of God. God is an infinite ocean of Holy Love, we cannot be His victims, but He is our victim.

The voice of the mad collective consciousness that always doubts God, and doesn't want to see its own mistakes, it is the nature of darkness.

To call the evil good, and the good evil, it is a sin against the Holy Spirit, and it is an unforgivable sin.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,  
postulates that : we cannot know the position and speed of a subatomic particle at the same time . The Heisenberg uncertainty principle does not demonstrate the liberty but the chaos. If a system is unpredictable it means that is chaotic or self-determined. And the Human Species is self-determined. Only God could imagine and determine the self- determination,  
He is self-determined, He is the effect without cause, and we have His Divine Nature, we can also create effects without cause, and this is what unite us, the possibility of creation, of choice.  
Freedom is the Profound Nature of God.  
We are not biological, biochemical robots. Our consciousness it is not an epiphenomenon of our biochemical machine that we call body, our consciousness it is not just a spectator of the movement of our biological machine, that we call body.  
Our consciousness is interconnected with the freedom, and they are both divine in Nature.

THIS IS THE CONDEMNATION: THAT THE LIGHT HAS COME INTO THE WORLD BUT THE PEOPLE LOVED DARKNESS RATHER THAN THE LIGHT, BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL

God is just, and His justice is perfect.  
We must let God, make the perfect justice, in this way we shall be perfect, like the victims from the beginning, of a divine nobility.

If you consume dark art that means you're a "goth ", a troubled teenager.  
If you create events, if you search people that produce psychic pain, it is the same thing, the same mental mechanism.  
It is because "this world likes darkness rather than the light "like Jesus said to Nicodimus.

The death and sex sells the best.  
What tells that about us?  
That Jesus was right, who comes not to Him it is that he or she prefers darkness rather than the light.  
The light is the Truth and this world like the self-deception.

I call the Mighty Name of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit of God!

God is every day with us, and we live in Paradise.  
But He cannot be crucified and worshiped in the same time.  
Jesus it is the same yesterday, today and forever

And the human species it the same like 2000 years ago, is crucifying God in the mind , and God continues to love us.  
He cannot protect us if we are busy putting nails in His hands and feet.

"Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever." Apostle Paul ( Hebrews 13:8)

JESUS NEVER LEFT.  
WE LEFT HIM.

God transformed the water into wine, not the filth into wine. Be full of water, or purify yourself through repentance and forgiveness, before asking for His Holy Spirit.

***

God loves the Human Species so much, that He wants to transcend it into a God Species. If you only knew the love and the nobility of God and His Holy Angels... God bless you all!

A single filthy thought can spoil all your mind.

Even bad publicity it is still publicity, every marketing person, knows that.  
This is the reason why I say to you: speak not of the evil spirits, because you will call them.  
***  
God loves the Human Species.  
Jesus Christ is the evidence.  
When God descended on this prison planet, the inmates crucified Him, and He proved the infinite love that He has for this decayed humanity.  
***

A house divided cannot stand.  
To try to divide the House of God it is an unforgivable sin.

Any punishment it is justified against such sin.  
And this book it is a weapon against the divider, a sword of light. The strongest weapon against the divider it is the lack of naivety and the word of God.

***  
Only when you see and condemn the darkness in you, can you see the Goodness of GOD.

***

Trial and error.  
We function by the algorithm of Trial an Error,  
if we do not recognize our errors we become dysfunctional.

***

The nostalgia of sin, felt sometimes by the angels and always by the mediocre.  
We sin because of our mediocrity in good deeds, the self-deception which follows the sin, builds a pathological arrogance.

***

Who believes not God, makes Him a liar. In God we trust.

Only in God.

***

The word of God makes you clean and Free.

***

I must convince my brothers to Trust in Jesus, if they want to get out of hell. To trust the Power of Light.

The Holy Spirit will not protect the Perverted Spirit.

My Faith saved me.  
If I am politically correct, I only have a temporary advantage, if I am divinely correct I will have peace for eternity.

***

I will always respect the moral of Jesus Christ.

The nature darkness is the self-deception.

To know God, you must first know yourself.  
You must have an Absolute sincerity with yourself in order to know the Absolute.

In a world of blind it can be empirical considered than the light does not exist.

"I tell the Truth, that's why you do not believe me " Jesus Christ.

***

And I walked in paradise and I sow a rose surrounded by weed. The next time I would like to see roses surrounding a weed.

Think only with the thoughts of Christ if you want to be really happy,

because the beautiful thoughts give beautiful feelings.

I tell you the Truth :  
The thoughts of Jesus are the thoughts of God.

Where is your heart, there is your treasure.

***  
The moral of Absolute is the moral of Jesus Christ . The true Image of God is Jesus Christ.

***

If God forgave me, I must also forgive my brothers.

***

My 24 karat DYMOND thought is:  
GOD PROTECTED THE VICTIMS FROM THE BEGINNING.

***

I prefer to think that whole world deceives itself, and God tells the truth.

***

If a whole planet say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing. I speak about the bad faith.

***  
The Forgiveness, The Love and The Justice of God do not contradict themselves. The ones who forgive will be forgiven, and therefore logically protected.  
The ones who love with a sincerely, holy love will receive the Love of God.  
And the ones who cry out for justice will receive justice ...  
***

The ones who are the protectors of the Truth, will be in truth protected.  
The ones who deceive themselves and others will be deceived. And the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.  
And God separated from the beginning the light from the darkness.

***

And Jesus was crucified in a place called Golgotha (the place of the Head).  
We crucify God daily in our minds, by our misjudgment and He continues to love us with a slight smile on His Holy Face. I know that by revelation.

***

God never left us, we left Him.  
For what?  
For the illusion of being morally superior to God and His angels.

This is a profound truth, and this is the origin of all the evil in the world.

***  
The moral of Christ is the moral of God.  
***

God loves you.  
God defended the victims from the beginnings.

***

What it is politically correct , can be morally wrong .  
War is morally wrong, but politically correct but that's no excuse in front of GOD.

***

Can you mathematically demonstrate the Love of God?  
Can you teach the snakes to love?  
In the same way a snake misses, a part of the brain to understand emotions (it is called reptilian brain in biology).  
In the same way, some of us cannot understand the love of God.  
Emotions are processed by the neocortex which is more complex in nature.

***  
THE POWER OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS. THE POWER OF THE NAME OF CHRIST. DEFEATS ALL ARMIES OF HELL.  
But you must repent and forgive first.

***

The most dangerous soul in hell is the one who believes he is an angel, who has forgotten he has fallen.

And this is the soul of man.

***

Respect God with all your mind , and you will enter in paradise. If you do Not respect God , you will Not enter in Paradise, and to respect God means also to do His Good Will, and the revealed Will of God is Jesus Christ.

***

God Never left Jesus ,  
We are the ones who left Jesus and God.

***  
We love God when we accept and recognize His Holy Love.  
***  
There isn't a stone that God cannot brake, there isn't a heart that cannot be humbled.

Don't curse the darkness, just turn on the light of prayer and fasting, and of the Holy Word of God.

The love of God it is the power of God.

Any soul that despises the Intelligence of The Creator of the Infinite Universe, no longer belongs for this mad arrogance to the Human Species.

To enter Paradise, you must first repent and forgive.

Not every criminal who knows he is evil will be freed.  
Not every murderer and a liar who knows he is a hater and a liar will be forgiven and liberated.

Not every prisoner who knows he made wrong will be freed.  
Only the prisoners who repent and forgive what the other prisoners have done to them. God loves with a Holy Love all the prisoners of His Justice.

It has no importance what you think about me, but it is very important what we think about God, and this is our judgement.

The difference between heaven and hell it is simply the degree of respect that we have for God.

Every thought has attached a feeling.  
It is not our feelings who determines our thoughts,

but our thoughts who causes our feelings. The feelings just follow the thoughts.

God cannot be lied to .

All of us who are unhappy, sad and depressed, are simply full of dark thoughts, and the dark feelings follow.

The power of the good deeds it is the Holy Path to an invincible Faith.

God is light , be not blind !

The ones who refuse to see God in all His beauty , are the ones who prefer to stay blind to their mistakes.

God always tells the truth, that's why some of us do not love Him , because they do not love what the truth says them about themselves.

"God is light , and in Him is no darkness at all."(1John 1:5)

When Jesus said: "Eli, Eli lama sabactani ?"

He was referring to us. We left Him.

GOD NEVER LEFT JESUS AND HE WILL NEVER LIVE US.

We left Him, like arrogant adulterous souls (unfaithful).

God sustains us into existence, He sustain our free immortal consciousness, who is a part of Him.

Without Him loving us , we cannot exist.

And He will love us indifferent of our mistakes , how He already revealed by His Crucifixion.

Every day is a day, in which we crucify God, by our mistakes, in our minds and hearts. And He continues to love us,

He always loved us,

To call the darkness light, it is an unforgivable sin, it is a sin against the Holy Spirit.

Jesus Christ, the Man who forgave his murderers, said that the sin against the Holy Spirit it is without forgiveness, it is a sin greater than murder, and to call evil good, it is such a sin.

The ones who are blind to the darkness from others, are the ones who deny the darkness from themselves, and they will become victims of their own self-deceit.

To say that abortions are good, just because they are an exercise of freedom, it is to call evil good, and the darkness light, a sin that The One who forgave and loved His murderers, said it is until the End of Eternity, without forgiveness.

***  
May the Power of Love of Jesus Christ, give you happiness and light. May the Power of Light of Jesus Christ, give you wisdom and love.

###  THE LOGICAL PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

"The Lord is Spirit, and where the Holy Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."

Corinthiens 3:17

« Spiritus Sanctus ubi vult spirat . » John 3 :8

"In a world of universal deceit , to tell the truth is a revolutionary act ." George Orwell.

We will begin with what we scientifically know. I am actually a scientist, I am a medical doctor, specialty anesthesia and intensive care, I was educated into the materialistic science, and did not despised it, I used it in order to know the world.

The science and religion actually have the same purpose, to know the truth.

The laws of nature, and the "logos", the word of God are actually the same.

The laws that make the galaxies move in an organized way, are the "logos", the word of God.

We know that the universe and the men are built from atoms, and subatomic particles.

According to classical physics if we theoretically know the position of all particles, atoms in the universe and the laws that govern them, we could theoretically predict the movement of the whole universe and men.

This is called materialistic determinism; it implies that there is no actually free will.

That was a big philosophical dilemma, until the apparition of the quantum physics. In our postmodern era many believe that the quantum physics has all the answers, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

"In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle, also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known simultaneously.

Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist Werner

Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928:

(ħ is the reduced Planck constant, h / 2π).

Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems. Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clear, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist- observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.

Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program" Wikipedia.

After the invention of the quantum physics the problem of materialistic determinism was solved by the materialistic indeterminism.

Because we cannot know with absolute precision the position of a subatomic particle, that means that the material universe is not absolutely predictable. This doesn't demonstrate that the Human Species is free, but only chaotic, the unpredictability doesn't prove the freedom, if it depends of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

Because we know also that we are free, and we know that we make conscious decisions, that means that we have another support, "hardware" for the freedom.

The "hardware" that can support a free consciousness cannot be material.

The mechanism that can make possible the freedom it is "a mechanism without mechanism" that I have tried to imagine , and I understood that only God can create something so complex , a mechanism that can make possible the self-determination.

An artificial consciousness, created by men , it is also impossible to create.

Only an infinite Intelligence , can imagine and create the support that can make possible the self-determination.

And the self-consciousness it is even more complex in the nature of its substance.

The "hardware " than can make possible the free consciousness is infinite in complexity ,and only a free creative being of infinite intelligence can create it.

Any scientist that says he can create an artificial consciousness is delusional , and only a fool can believe him.

History will prove me right, because in the present there will be many that will pretend they do not understand me, in order to hide from the humanity and from themselves the reality of the existence of God. As Jesus said " The light has come into the world , but people love the darkness rather than the light", and in a genius way Jesus gave also the explanation: " because their deeds were evil, for everyone who does what is hateful, hates The Light and does not come to The Light, lest his works should be convicted. But he who does The Truth comes to The Light, so that his works may be revealed".

And God is self-determined by definition.

God is the effect without cause.

And our profound nature is divine also , because our profound nature is the free consciousness , the self-determination.

Because we are free we are self-determined.

The spirit is self-determined, the effect it is without cause, this is the profound nature of God, because God is freedom, God is The creator, and His Profound Nature is the self- determination. We are what came out of God(Exo Deus lat.), we are also self-determined souls, we have the nature of God (Regnum Dei lat.), we are also free and creators.

In the mater:

A------------------------------->B

CAUSE \-------------------->EFFECT

In the spirit:

self-determination ----------------->B

self-determination -------------------->EFFECT

B is effect without cause

B is self-determined

The EFFECT it is without CAUSE

The EFFECT is self-determined.

Spirit, the Profound Nature of God and Man----->EFFECT

God is the effect without cause, and we are divine in nature because we are free. We are not biochemical robots, we are not just biological machines, we are self- determined consciousness that could only came from God.

This is logical.

And this is the profound reason for what God does not make the decisions for us, He lets us make our own decisions, because, we are by Nature self-determined, we are like Him, Regnum Dei not Regnum Animalis.

In the material world A determines B

In the spiritual world B is self-determined, there is no cause for B, and this is the Profound Nature of God and of all the souls that came out of God.

Actually the souls are sustained into existence because of the will of God. We exist because God sustains our consciousness and freedom, our spiritual and physical bodies.

We exist because God loved us into existence, and He loves us because we were born, and we were born of Him, of the Original self-determined and creator spirit, the Spirit of the Truth, the Holy Spirit.

The origin of our actions, words and thoughts, of the will, is the selfdetermination, it is in and through the nature of our souls, that have the same Nature as the Nature of God. We are Regnum Dei, we are not regnum animalis, as our current science says.

Einstein said in his book, the Theory of relativity for all, that "we cannot will to will ".

Actually he was very close of the understanding of the Nature of God and of the souls, but he didn't understood, because he stayed in the

paradigm of materialism, he imagined other dimensions, and the

quantum physic imagine also other dimensions other parallel universes , but they stay in the "box" of materialism , of determinism or the chaotic subatomic indeterminism, but they reject the idea that it is a dimension , a "universe" where not the laws of physics rule, but the will of the souls, not the exterior determinism, but the interior self-determinism.

There is a parallel universe and it is self-determined, it is called, God and the souls that came out of God.

The matter cannot support a hardware, even of infinite complexity, that can have a self- determined consciousness, and it is empirically proven that we are self-determined consciousness. For example, very similar group of people do not behave the same in various

psychological experiments, in the same conditions. There is a majority that behave in a predictable manner, but not all. And this is the empirical demonstration that we are free.

The Nature of The "hardware" that can support the freedom and consciousness it is so complex, that there is no human mind that can imagine it, even Einstein when he said we "cannot will to will" ...we simply will...and the origin of the will is in our divine Nature. We are Regnum Dei, not Regnum Animalis.

You cannot do human medicine if you only studied veterinary medicine, you can understand some things, you can brutally treat some diseases, but you absolutely cannot understand all the human medicine by only studying veterinary medicine.

In the same way with applying our quantum physics into understanding God.

Only God could imagine and determine the self-determination, He is self-determined, He is the effect without cause, and we have His Divine Nature, we can also create effects without cause, and this is what unite us, the possibility of creation, of choice.

Freedom is the Profound Nature of God.

We are not biological, biochemical robots. Our consciousness it is not an epiphenomenon of our biochemical machine that we call body, our

consciousness it is not just a spectator of the movement of our biological machine, that we call body.

Our consciousness is interconnected with the freedom and they are both divine in Nature.

Some of us depend on the void logic of mathematics, I relay on the live logic of common sense.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle does not demonstrate the liberty but the chaos. If a system is unpredictable it means that is chaotic or selfdetermined.

And the Human Species is self-determined

We are immortal nucleus of free consciousness and we have the same profound Nature as the profound Nature of God.

And this is the reason why God doesn't make the decisions for us , because if He would that meant that we wouldn't be free.

We came of God, we are pieces of God, we are free and immortal, supra-materialistic. Our bodies are just biological robots that were given to us

from God, it is our choice if we want or not to live on autopilot.

It is the free immortal consciousness , our soul, that controls the biological machine , that we call body.

After the invention of the quantum physics the problem of materialistic determinism was solved by the materialistic indeterminism.

Because we cannot know with absolute precision the position of a subatomic particle, that means that the material universe is not absolutely predictable. This doesn't demonstrate that the Human Species is free, but only chaotic, the unpredictability doesn't prove the freedom, if it depends of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

Because we know also that we are free, and we know that we make conscious decisions, that means that we have another support, "hardware" for the freedom.

Because we are free we are self-determined.

God is the effect without cause. He is self-determined.

And we are to self-determined because we are free, ergo we have the same nature with God..

We came out of God, we came out of the Father of lights, we simply created the darkness.

Because we are free, we can also make effects without cause.

Because God is Absolute in Good, Truth and Beauty, it implies logically that we are the only responsible for our destiny.

Because we are self-determined, we are powerful and responsible, the masters of our own destiny.

God is Spirit ,and where the Holy Spirit of God is, there is freedom.

God is freedom , in the absolute superior form of organization.

God is The Creator , and the superior form of organization of freedom is the creation. And we are not only mater , superior organized like the atheist materialist say, but we came out of God, and we were given by God , the supreme gift of freedom and creation.

We are parts of God, our spirit exists because He sustains us into existence, even when we crucify Him by our mistakes, He continues to love us.

The love of God , sustains us into existence, even when we use our freedom in an arrogant way.

Because we are free there must be a support, hardware for the selfdetermination.

In the classical physics A det. B

In the quantum physics A det. B

or A det. C

In the spirit :

B it is self-determined

There is no cause for B

The structure of the soul cannot be imagined by the human mind.

It is a mechanism without mechanism.

This is the truth and God cannot be lied to.

This is the testimony of a saved soul by Jesus Christ .

I will not say that I do not know Christ, like someone in the Bible before His Crucifixion , because I know Him , and He knows me better than I know myself, and He knows you also better then you want to know yourself.

But Socrates said "know yourself " and Jesus said " you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free". And when you will have the courage to see yourself beyond your mistakes you will find in you God.

God lives in you, live also in God, through God and for God , by doing His Holy Will. Use your self-determination in a wise and good way , because any way that doesn't lead to God , leads to darkness.

I shall not say that I do not know God in the day of His crucifixion, and every day is a day in which the humankind crucifies God by its misjudgment.

It took a man , not a machine, to find the truth.

The artificial free consciousness it is an utopia.

###  The Solution to the problem of evil.

"It is your eye evil , because I am good ?" GOD , Mat.20:15

We all devolved from a higher purer humanity , that had , at the beginning , a divine identity, a born divine nobility. We were human divine and from a divine humanity. At the beginning God created all perfect in body and spirit.

And because of the rebellion against the moral of God we devolved.

We created another moral, but it was proven to us wrong.

I advise you to return to the moral of God, who is forgiveness and holy love of any soul that came out of Him.

I did that and He made me as I was in the beginning , God cleansed me in His own blood, so I am clean.

Now we know that God exists.

And it is logical that God loves His creation.

This is common sense logic.

God loves all the souls that came out Him as He loves Himself. We are parts of God, we cannot exist separated from Him, we think we left Him but He never left us.

God loves the Human Species.

All the souls because they are self-determined, they have the same nature as the nature of God. We are all parts of God, we were born of God, and God loves us because we were born.

God not only created us, but He sustains us into existence, by never stopping to love us , even when we crucify Him by our mistakes, by our bad thoughts, by our misjudgement.

And we know that we are self-determined, and responsible for our own lives.

The philosophical problem of evil tormented me for years. I was obsessed by this problem.

And I solved it, the solution is : The victims from today are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the beginning were defended by God , even if yesterday the aggressors were in other bodies , in other lives .

The demonstration of existence of reincarnation: The premise: GOD IS JUST

Conclusion: we all deserve our fate: we pay for sins from past lives.

Because GOD IS JUST, we deserve our pain, and we pay sins from past lives. This explains why some of us are born to suffer, actually they are born to pay because in another life they made another person suffer.

Anybody who doesn't believe in reincarnation and he says he believes that God is just, lies. It is logical for any non-dogmatic free mind.

That means that every victim from today , is an aggressor from yesterday, even that yesterday he was is an another body.

The today's victims are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the beginning were defended by God.

God loves the Human Species.

God loves you because you were born!

Receive God's Holy Love!

BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE VICTIMS FROM THE BEGINNING?

THEY WERE DEFENDED BY GOD.

The beginning it is the first civilization.

When God created the Human Species, He created it perfect.

The first civilization was very spiritually and technological developed.

We were born from the Perfect One.

At the beginning we really felt our Born Divine Nobility, we felt and accepted our divine identity.

We were one with God, but humble in God's Holy Spirit, we were humble in front of God.

The Beginning

Aggressors \-------------->Victims

The victims, from the Beginning were defended by God

Past

reincarnated Aggressors with sins to pay the fall of Atlantis= the flood of Noah=tsunami

Present

Aggressors, that believe that they are Victims

"For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body, but made alive in the spirit, in which He also went and preached to the spirits in

prison who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built." Peter (1, 3:18-20).

"But they deliberately overlook the fact that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water, through which the world of that time perished in the flood. And by that same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men...."Peter (2,3:5-7)

The Apostol Peter said that "they deliberately overlook" because as our savior Jesus Christ said : "This is the judgment: The Light has come into

the world and the children of men loved the darkness more than The Light, because their works were evil. For everyone who does what is hateful, hates The Light and does not come to The Light, lest his works should be convicted. But he who does The Truth comes to The Light, so that his works may be revealed, that they are performed by God." (John 3).

If you realize that you are an old aggressor, reincarnated, and God is really good, if you repent and forgive all, the blood of God, of Jesus Christ, can clean you and make you like the victims from the beginning, and you will be protected by The Holy Spirit like the victims from the beginning.

The Holy Trinity wants to help us.

We just must see that we are the evil ones, not God.

If you think you are an innocent victim and you suffer unjustly you make a Sin Against the Spirit of the Truth, and you are not in the truth.

Let's assume that a serial killer makes a stroke and forgets all that he has done, even believes that he is as innocent as a child.

Let's assume that nobody knew he was a murderer ,and that he succeeded before the stroke to hide his traces.

Then he is hospitalized in a top university clinic where is treated by the most famous professors in neurology.

In the day of divine justice, the murderer and the professors believed that he suffered unjustly, that the destiny was unjust with the poor man.

They all are guilty of the sin of unbelief and they are out of paradise.

But the serial killer will suffer more than the professors.

But the disbelief of the teachers will not go unpunished also, because you see : he was a murderer and he must be punished.

In the same way with this prison planet.

Some of them are murderers and suffer greatly, some of them are unbelievers and suffer less, but they all suffer: because they offend The God of Love , assuming that He is unjust.

And everyone deserves their karma and the victims from the beginning were defended by God.

But why the professors, men and women with deep minds who understood the complexity of the brain could not understand the goodness, the justice and the love of God ?

Simply , I answer: because of the very high image of themselves that they had , because they too had made mistakes.

Because whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.

So it is with the ones who want to forget that they are born again, some for life some for death.

Because GOD IS JUST, we deserve our pain, and we pay sins from past lives. This explains why some of us are born to suffer, actually they are born to pay because in another life they made another person suffer.

The victims from today are yesterday's aggressors, and the victims from the Beginning were defended by God.

At the beginning God created us all good, perfect in body and spirit.

We all had the Born Nobility of God.

We all of any race or color have devolved from the angelic state of the first divine men, that were in communion with the Holy Spirit.

Ecce Homo(Behold the man): Jesus Christ, who showed us the true face of God, and the true moral and power of the Light.

I have searched a man with a candle during the day like Diogenes, the cynic, and I found Him in Heaven, and His Name is Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ is the true image of God and man.

And the key to the gate of Heaven is :Repentance and Forgiveness through Jesus Christ, our divine savior .

We are all, indifferent of nationality or race, the descendants of a Higher and purer Humanity that came out of God.

This is logical because GOD IS JUST AND GOD IS LOVE So :THE LOVE OF GOD IS OUR JUDGE.

And some of us have fallen some of us have not.

The known Human Species it is an involution from the Initial Human Species that had the Born Nobility of God.

Actually in the eyes of the Holy Spirit the actual Human Species it is Post human, had lost the divine nobility from the beginning and had lost actually the humanity itself.

Ecce Homo(Behold the man): Jesus Christ.

We belong not to the animal kingdom (regnum animalis ) but to God's Kingdom ( Regnum Dei).

But , attention my friends: who despises the law or the word of God will be let to the law of the jungle.

I have searched a man with a candle during the day like Diogenes, the cynic, and I found Him in Heaven, and His Name is Jesus Christ.

"Who controls the past controls the future, and who controls the present controls the past" George Orwell

References of reincarnation in the Bible:

Archangel Gabriel:

"And he (John the Baptist) shall go before God, in the spirit and power of Elias"

Luke 1:17

" And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?

But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.

But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto

him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.

Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist."

Mat. 17:10
