### Chapter 1

### Welcoming of Giovanni

Hello world, my name is Giovanni Stephens. I am a musician and instrument salesmen. I have a twin sister and her name is Gwendolyn Stephens. She has always been a bother while growing up but I still love her.

I have an amazing family tree. Mostly everyone in my family was a thief. I believe it all started in 1557 with my ancestor Phelphian "Le Grand Voleur", which means Phelphian "The Great Thief". He was known for looting much of the royal family's treasures in 1575. He was later brought to the scaffolds about five years later. Ever since his death, there have been many people in my family following in his footsteps. Many have been caught, and a few actually got away. But now were in the 21st century so I believe I can surpass all of those before me.

My father tried to continue the tradition but he was arrested on the day I was born. I have no clue to how they caught him. It has always been a tradition to leave a signature behind to let the police know that it was no amateur thief.

My grandfather was a potter and he always left a bird sculpture at the scene of the crime. Following the tradition, my father, Roberto Stephens, was an artist and he mostly looted paintings. His signature marking was a red rose painting located in the spot where the painting originally was.

...

I will be turning 21 next Friday which is October 20th. That will be the day that marks my day of continuing in the family business. I've been training really hard trying not to end up in the same predicament as my father. I told my sister, Gwen, not to attempt it because I don't want her to get into any trouble with the law, yet she dismisses it.

We were always the top students of our classes but that wasn't exciting enough for either of us. That might explain why we didn't pursue high paying jobs. While I'm writing music, she is selling flowers. The good thing that came out of our job choices is that it wasn't that hard making a business franchise.

My music store is called Gi-Gi's Light Players. I even branched off by creating jazz clubs and a great number of coffee shops/bookstores. You might be wondering, "If this guy makes so much money, why steal?" Well the answer to that question is, for the excitement. Many people want excitement in their lives but can never find it. It's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's hard to think of stealing in a good way. But whenever someone steals from a museum it will bring the media and people will want to visit it to see how a person could do it or just to visit the crime scene.

So far the hardest thing about stealing was coming up with an alias and something to symbolize you. I could always leave some type of instrument, but what kind. I couldn't leave a big instrument because it'll kind of be too hard to hide. And then it hit me, "What if I left a piece of an instrument," I thought to myself "but which instrument?" I looked around my store to find the perfect instrument, and then the door chimed meaning someone has entered.

"How may I help you sir?" I asked.

I was wondering do you guys offer piano lessons. My wife just bought a piano from you guys a couple of weeks back for our daughter. And lets just say, she is not a great player," said the man.

"I'm sorry sir we don't offer piano lessons here," I replied. "But I know someone who does. About three stores down there's a guy named Alfred who works at the World of Music, he might be able to help you"

"Thanks for the info," said the guy as he left for the store.

Why must people continue to come into my store asking for lessons? I see if it said, "We offer lessons," on the door but gosh. Does it look like we offer piano lessons? "Wait a second!" I said out loud. "Pianos...Pianos...That's it!" If that guy ever comes back in here I must thank him. I now have something to symbolize me.

I searched around my shop to see if it was still there. I couldn't use any of my new shipment so I had to find the old one. And then I found it in the basement. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It was my old piano; it had to have been at least two hundred years old. And thankfully there were about five boxes of replacement piano keys.

But now the only thing I had to do is get a great costume and a great name that fits it. I decided to close early so I can drive home and ransack my closet for former Halloween costumes. It's kind of ironic that I have so many costumes but I do live down the street from a costume store.

I had soon arrived home and ran upstairs to my walk-in closet that contained all of my costumes. I didn't see anything that influenced me. I was soon drawing a blank on the perfect costume that suited me. So I decided to go relax on my bed and maybe something will come to me...something useful and inspirational.

As I lay there I began to fall asleep. As I dreamt of nothing but music there was no sign of an idea coming. When I woke up I looked at my bedside clock to see that it was only 8 o'clock. I had only slept for about two and a half hours. I decide to turn on my TV and when I did I heard a duet between a male and a female. As I listened I began to realize what it was that I was hearing. It was a famous opera. Famous indeed, for many kids of this time even knew about its beauty. It was one of my favorite operas. It was "The Phantom of the Opera." And at that moment all my ideas formulated into one being. For at that point of time I had my costume and my alias.

Unlike the phantom from "The Phantom of the Opera", I wouldn't be a stalker trying to get someone to love me for me. But I would need a mask. But what kind of mask is the question, maybe a ghost-like mask or a black Zoro-like mask? The phantom's mask covered up one side of his face, the side that represented his faults and his shame. Maybe my mask can be something like that?

"I got it," I said out loud. I'm going to get two different masks. One of my masks will cover half my face and the other can cover my entire face. Now I have to get the costume and make some changes to it.

Seeing that it's only 8:15, I decided to drive to Fabric city to buy some fabric for my costume. After that I went to Máscara to buy a mask for my costume. And finally I went to C. C.'s, which was my codename for the Costume place. It was actually called Custom Costumes. Once I arrived, I asked Chuck, the manager, if he had the blueprints for the "Phantom of the Opera" costume. After searching for about five minutes he found them and handed them to me.

Chuck then asked, "Gigi if I may ask, what do you need it for?"

Being the nice guy that I am, I answered him, "I'm having my annual Halloween party and needed an idea for my costume."

"Oh...Why not get one of the ones that are on display," questioned Chuck.

"I was going to get one of them if my costume didn't come out right," I lied.

"Oh okay," said Chuck.

"Have a nice evening," I called out to Chuck as I took my leave. I really was going to buy a costume from him later for my Halloween party but I needed him to think that I was going to just stick with the "Phantom of the Opera" idea. My plan was to make my costume and go back at a later time and ask him to make me a different costume because mine looked hideous after I finished.

It's a good thing that I know how to sow like a pro or my plan would go straight down the toilet. As I looked at the blueprints to the costume I began to get more and more inspired. Seeing that I had two masks I decided to go back to Fabric City to buy some more fabric for my costume.

Without taking a break between my sowing I ended up finishing my first costume. It looked magnificent and it almost brought me to tears. But I didn't cry, I said almost. But after making my first one, I decided to clean out one of my closets and began to rearrange things so I could put my costume in it. That first costume influenced me to make more than two. After I make my first two costumes, I'm going to go back to Fabric City and Máscara and buy enough to make ten different costumes. I will keep the styles of my two signature costumes and just make back-ups just in case.

Now the only thing I have to do is decide what will be the first thing I'm going to steal. Which museum will be better? Maybe something that is near by. Or I can just search for one on the internet. But first maybe I should take some thing precious to get my name out there. I can always try the brave approach my writing a letter to the police to inform them of my plans. If everything goes well it might not be a very long time until the world hears about the great "Phantom Keys".

### Chapter 2

### Gwendolyn in Truth

As you may know, my name is Gwendolyn Stephens, but you can call me Gwen. As you may know already, my brother is Giovanni. He is so over protective of me, as if I can't take care of myself. I have a black belt in many martial arts, but that must be the consequences of having an older brother.

My brother can be so naïve at times. To be honest, he doesn't know much about our family. I suppose he has told you about our ancestry and all. But there is something that he doesn't know about our former generation.

There is one secret that he doesn't know. He doesn't know why our father went to jail. To be honest, I didn't know either until I was told by my sources. It was actually quite surprising when I found out. But after a while, I understood why it was done. Here comes a flash back...

...

My brother and I were two years old. My mother and father both loved the art known as pottery. My mother was a professional potter and my father was a policeman. One day my mother thought she should tell my father her biggest secret.

"Hello babe," said my father as he entered into the room.

"Hey Roberto," she replied. "I was thinking about something very important. It's hard for me to say because I don't know how you'll react."

"What is it that you want to tell me, my precious Kimberly?" he responded.

"See I've been holding a secret from you for so long but I don't know how to tell you. It's is one of those secrets that can drive a wedge between your heart."

"Kim? Please don't tell be you've been cheating on me," he stated, almost near the point of tears.

"No honey, it's not—"

"Thank goodness," Roberto said with a sigh.

"Don't feel so relieved yet," said Kim as calmly as possible.

My father stood there trying to grasp my mother's words. "But Kim? What can it be? Are you leaving me? Why are you so silent? Is it the kids? Answer me woman!"

Staring blankly at Roberto a tear fell down her checks. "Why won't you answer me Kim," he continued. "You know I love you. I would give the world to you if I must. Did someone close to you die? How can I help you honey? Do you still love me at all? Am I just a waste of your time?" At that point in time he began to tear up.

"Robby, I still love you," said Kimberly. "It's just that after I tell you my darkest secret, you might not look at me the same way. I don't want to loose you at all. Do you promise that you won't over react?"

"Yes. I promise that I will not go ballistic."

She began to move slightly farther away from him. "See...throughout my family's ancestry, most of them were thieves. What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm the mistress of the night that that most of the city know as...," she then sobbed and stood silent for a moment, "as 'Alas preciadas del Ángel'"

In less then five seconds, Roberto ran across the room and grabbed Kim friskily by her arm and threw her to the ground. "How dare you keep this from me!" he yelled. "How are you think that you could just come out of no where and tell me this kind of foolishness? And I loved you! You make me sick to my stomach." He then approached her semi-lifeless body and pulled her to her feet. "You know what I must do right? I place you under arrest on the account of burglary. Any thing you say or do will..."

As he read her the riot act, Kim began to think about her life without me and my brother. Roberto began to reach behind his back to get his hand-cuffs when Kimberly began to fight back.

Being as skilled as she was, she fought him off and hit him on the head with a frying pan. He had instantly passed out from the trauma. And at that moment she devised a plan. She had to protect herself. Kim knew that the man that she had come to love would never love her again. She had to protect her kids from what she has already done and what she is going to do.

She sent a letter to the police telling them of her next heist. She was to steal the "Grand Jewel of the Persian King". But this time, the police were going to catch their culprit. Her plan was full-proof. No matter if Roberto was to gain consciousness or not her plan will still be perfect.

That night, she snuck into the Buckner Museum to attempt to take the jewel. She was successful. She had then made her way to an alley in which she new the cops would soon find. Roberto's body was sitting on the outer railings of the museum. She tossed a line onto the next roof and jumped and made a scuff mark on the wall with Roberto's right shoe. She placed Roberto's body about a foot or two away from the wall. She had then yanked on her pulley and made the roofing fall to the ground. With quickness, some of the building's roofing came down. The small bits of ruble landed on Roberto's still body. And after doing all of that she soon made a quick escape.

...

When my mother told me that story I was shocked. After all of those years of lying to us about our father she finally chose to tell me. I blame guilt. But I couldn't blame her for her actions. I think she did what she did for the safety oh me and Giovanni. But if I were in her shoes, I would have thought about shooting him first. How dare he put his hands on her! But she did say she loved him. He should count himself lucky.

"Excuse me ma'am. Can you tell me which one of these flowers is tulips?" questioned an old lady.

"Sure," I replied. Why must customers always come in here asking questions like that? It's not like the flowers aren't labeled. While pointing, I said, "Ma'am these are tulips. The flower that you're holding in your arms is the white rose."

"Oh. Thank you dearly. This plant is so beautiful. It is more beautiful than any rose I've ever seen."

"Thanks so much. I find them quite amusing as well. I grow them in my personal garden. They're like a pure soul absent of any sin, and untainted by any outside forces."

"Who would have known?" asked the little old lady.

"What do you mean?" I questioned.

"Who would have known that a person can be so poetic due to a flower? You are one strange person." She paused for a moment and continued by saying, "I can see the care that you have for all of these flowers, yet you sit the white rose on a pedestal. Is it your light?"

"My light? I don't understand your question, ma'am," I stated, with a blank expression on my face.

"I was asking, is the white rose your guide." Seeing that my blank expression was still placed upon my face, she put things into perspective. "A person's light is the thing that guides you through the darkness. It represents all of your goodness. It shows the true you. In truth, the white rose is your guardian."

"I understand now. I guess it is. Excuse me, may I have your name. You are a very insightful woman."

"Sure," she said as she began to reach into her purse. "My name is Meredith Chambers and here is my card." After handing me her card she left my flower shop.

I took a look at the card and it read:

Meredith Chambers. Owner of Máscara. If you need a mask, come down to my shop and your life's journeys will finally begin.

The card seemed weird to me. It's as if it was calling out to me. Telling me some unknown truth to myself. What could it be?

While I was pondering on Mrs. Chambers' business card, my cell phone began to ring. It was my brother. He sent me a text message telling me that he had left work early today and will take to me tomorrow because he had some type of epiphany. Why must he send me these text messages? Why not call me instead?

What would have caused him to have an epiphany? I'll find out tomorrow. He probably thought of a new song or something like that. Or he could have found out when and where our annual Halloween party is going to be. He could have also found a great costume arrangement for us.

As I sat there wondering about my brother and his epiphany, my new boyfriend walked through the door. He was carrying a box of chocolate. Like my mother, we both share the same interest in our types of men.

"What can I do for you detective." I called out to him.

"Hey Gwen. So what should we do tonight?" he asked.

"I feel like having some Japanese. What about you?" I questioned knowing what the answer was.

"Anything you want. Because just having you in my company will feel me up. My stomach is a big as my eyes and the thing in my sight is too much for any man. I love the way you fill me up, both body and soul Gwen," he said romantically.

With a giggly smirk on my face I replied, "Marcus, you always no what to say. I'm going to close early so we can leave right now"

I surely did know how to pick them. He completed me. I'm going to enjoy having him within my grasp. He truly completed me.

As we left my flower shop, he kissed me on my check. He told me where a great restaurant was located and told me that he'll be waiting for me. I was to show up around ten, which fit my schedule perfectly. I still had to pay Gigi a little visit.

As I drove toward Gigi's house I noticed his car wasn't in its normal spot which ant he was out. So I continued to drive past his house to Mrs. Chambers' business to see what she was so important.

When I arrived, I saw Gigi's car leaving. That was quite weird to me. I wonder if she paid him a visit as well. Did she help him come to his great epiphany? Too many questions with no answers.

As soon as I walked into the store Mrs. Chambers greeted me. The way she greeted me made me feel as if I were family. She is somewhat strange. Did she have some elaborate plan going on here?

"This is a great place you have here," I said to Mrs. Chambers.

"Why thank you, dearly," she replied.

"I was stopping by to see what your business. It looks as if you have many visitors," I said as if I was trying to hurry up and leave.

"I made something for you. I think it's beautiful," she said while leaving the room. When she returned, she was holding a mask in her hand. "This mask is quite magnificent. It is made out of glass and I'm sure it'll fit you perfectly. Go on, try it on."

I slowly put the mask on my face. As she had stated, it really was a perfect fit. "This is wonderful! How were you able to make it so that it fit my face perfectly? I don't even need a string to hold it to my face. Did you say it was made of glass?"

"I did. The art of making masks has been in my family for some time now. But to make a mask from glass is quite difficult. But I learned a way to perfect my talents, but that'll always be a secret," she had then retreated behind her counter. "I'm known for my wonderful mask making, just ask your brother."

As if I were shocked I stated, "How do you know my brother? Is he the reason you visited my flower shop today?"

Mrs. Chambers began laughing. "No, Ms. Gwen I can see the resemblance. Your brother does visit this place often. In fact he just left not too long before you came. Back to the mask, you can have it. But if you need more, just give me a call. But next time I might have to charge you."

"That's good to know," I said as I approached the door. "Have a nice day Mrs. Chambers. And I will give you a call when ever I need a new mask."

I jumped into my car and drove away. I drove pass my brother's house once again and his car was no where in sight. It took some time to get back to my house but thankfully I had a lot of time to get ready for my date tonight.

I decided to wear my dark green dress. It was my favorite because of the curviness it gave the body. I slipped on my heels and put a white rose in my hair. I had to admire myself in the mirror for a few minutes. After putting on my make-up and gathering some important things, I hopped into my car and drove off. I was so happy because I'm going to be dining with my wonderfully handsome detective boyfriend.

### Chapter 3

### A Hard Days Work

Crime has been down recently. That is both a good thing and a bad thing. I'm glad that I don't get paid for every criminal I catch. I should feel happy that I'm not like most of the officers at the precinct. I'm just happy that I was raised with money. Sure I'm rich but not many people know it. I did not want to subject myself as being another stereotypical rich kid who lives off of mommy and daddy's money. I want to make it on my own, at least for now.

Later on I have a date with one of the most beautiful women in the world. She has style and flare. But most of all, she was perfect. It is true that no human is perfect, but her flaws make her better. I love her so much but I'm too scared of taking a giant leap into this relationship.

I can't wait to see her tonight. She decided that we should have Japanese. I should probably get something that is fancy. I want to look great. Will tonight be the night? Will I finally ask her to marry me? I love her too much to let her go another day without a ring on her finger. I can remember the first day I met her. It is as if I met her yesterday.

...

Three months ago I was patrolling. I so happened to have passed this exquisite flower shop that I never bothered to notice. Seeing that all was calm, I decided to observe it. When I entered I was approached by the warm and caring air that resided in the flower shop. And then I heard an almost angelic voice call out to me.

"Hello officer, welcome to Gwen's," she said from behind her counter. "How may I help you today, sir?"

"You can call me Marcus," I said, "this is a lovely establishment you have here. And I just looking around."

"Okay sir...I mean Marcus. But I'll be here if you need me."

I continued to look around the store until I saw my mother's favorite plant. "Excuse me, Ms.—"

"Stephens...but you may call me Gwen," she said with a beautiful smile on her face. "Do you need my assistance?"

"Yes. I was wondering what type of plant this is."

"That is a Chrysanthemum. Is it for your girlfriend, if I may ask?"

Is she flirting with me or is she serious? To humor the topic I told her the truth. "No, this is my mother's favorite type of plant. I don't have a girlfriend at the time." After I said that, I saw a flicker in her eyes. "But if I may ask, would you mind being her, or am I being a little too forward."

Gwen began to giggle. "That sounds nice but I've only just met you."

"I know. That's the reason why I want to date you, to become even closer to you. You are a very unique person and I would like to get to know you." I couldn't believe those words were coming out of my mouth. I've always been the quiet type, but when I spoke to her, I spoke from my true being, the being that I have not known of existing. "So what do you say?"

"Nice way of putting it. I might as well say yes." She walked behind the counter and returned with a piece of paper with her number on it. "Call me anytime."

...

Since that day, my life was wonderful. I feel as if she really completes me. The things that I like she like. She is my soul mate and I want to be with her until the die I die. I can barely imagine living without her.

I'm glad that our dinner date is at ten o'clock. That gives me enough time to make get everything prepared for tonight. Tonight will be the night to remember.

### Chapter 4

### A Night to Remember

I pulled up to the Japanese restaurant feeling over excited. I couldn't wait to get inside to see Marcus. He called me not too long ago and promised me the best night of my life. I was looking magnificent and I just know that he's going to be looking great.

When I open the door I saw nothing but beauty. They had a table that represented the entire country of Japan. It had every mountain, every river and stream, and it even had a few waterfalls. As soon as I walked in I almost cried from the scene. I was absolutely astonished. The employees were kind and all uplifting.

As the waiter guided me to my seat, I happened to know that the restaurant was quite empty. It was a group of people near the entrance of the restaurant but they were so quite that I barely heard them. Another group was sitting in the back, but they kept themselves at a whisper.

After waiting for a minute or two, Marcus appeared looking very handsome. He was dressed in a dark shade of blue that almost looked black. As he sat down I found myself staring at him with amazement.

"I reserved the restaurant for the two of us, but some others had already reserved there spots for tonight as well," said Marcus. I forgot all about the other occupants in the restaurant. "I promised you that tonight will be the best night of your life and I meant it. But first, let us order."

We sent our waiter off with our meal choices. I wonder if tonight will be the night. I want him to propose to me. But I believe everything shall happen in time.

Our meals soon came afterwards. The food smelled delightful. I made sure that I took small bites to make sure that I don't accidently swallow the ring. I finished off everything on my plate and still no ring. I somewhat felt disappointed. I thought tonight was going to be the night.

Marcus then stood and announced, "Let's get up out of here. I already paid the bill. I was prepared for anything. So may I have my lady so I can escort her out?"

When I walked outside, I saw a stretch limo that was waiting for me and Marcus. Hope is not lost. Maybe he will still propose to me.

We stepped into the limo and it drove off. We were riding for almost thirty minutes until we suddenly came to a stop. Marcus rolled down the window and spoke to the driver, "What is wrong? Why did we stop?"

The driver turned around and gave a scandalous smile. The doors then opened wide. Two people dressed in all black sprayed some stuff into our eyes that knocked us out.

...

When I woke up I saw that we were in a ware house. I looked to my right and there, hanging right beside me was Marcus. The culprits had us both tied up hanging by our hands. The rope was giving me a rope burn. Marcus looked as if they had beaten him. His face was bruised all over.

"Marcus...Marcus," I whispered.

He began to groan. His eyes flickered. He couldn't fully open his eyes because they were swollen. I began to tear up.

"Gwen?" he called out.

"I'm here," I replied.

"There's something I need to tell you," he struggled to say. "I had tonight planned out. Well not this part. I wanted you to have a nice romantic dinner at the Japanese restaurant. And then we were going to have a cruise in my yatch. And when we got near my family's island, I was going to propose to you." I began to cry. "Don't cry Gwen. You know I hate to see you sad. Remember that I will always love you Gwen."

"Well, well, well, how touching," said a stranger. "Seeing that your little woman is fully awake now, maybe you might want to cooperate. Now tell me where your family's fortune is hidden. Or your little lady friend here is gonna pay the price."

The stranger then pulled me by my hair which made me yelp. "Let me go, or you'll regret your decision of kid napping me."

"Regret in what way," said the stranger. He then raised his hands and struck me across my face. As soon as he hit me, Marcus screamed.

"I'll tell you...just let her go," said Marcus.

"I'll let her go when you tell me what I want to know," he replied.

"DON'T TELL HIM ANYTHING!" I yelled at the top of my lungs.

"Shut up tramp!" said the kidnapper as he slapped me across my face once again.

That was the last straw. I eased my feet out of their confinements and kicked our holder in his face. I then managed to raise myself up to free my hands. I soon found a saw and cut myself free. By that time the culprit was back to his feet. Then his other friends came out of nowhere and tried to jump me. Not knowing that I was a master of many martial arts tactics, they attacked. I manage to knock out at least five of them until a buff man hit me across my back with a metal pole.

Is this the last of me? I thought to myself. How could such a perfect day come to a bitter ending? Marcus I love you.

The pain from the hit soon evaporated into nothingness and I rose back up. I felt like new, but there was something different. My vision was still blurry but all I could see was red. Had I gone to hell? What have I done wrong?

My vision began to start clearing up and I could see that it was fire. It was surrounding me. I was still in the warehouse. All of the kidnappers that were still conscious were looking at me in astonishment. At that moment I noticed that the fire was coming from me. But how could this be? The fire died down and I felt newly energized.

I charged at them and with great force knocked the remaining four to the ground. I ran to Marcus to help him down. "Marcus, are you okay?"

I cut him down. "Yeah, I'm fine. Why is your body so warm?" he said. He was still quite weak but he continued to talk. "You are the...the best thing that has ever come to me. I love you." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a box. "Gwendolyn Rebecca Stephens, will you marry me."

Tears started to form in my eyes. "Yes! Yes! I would love to marry you. I love you so much Marcus."

"I love you too, Gwen." After he said those words, Marcus passed out. With all of my strength I was able to carry him to the now empty limo. I drove Marcus to the hospital, where I fell sound asleep waiting for him by his bedside. This truly was a night to remember.

### Chapter 5

### Life Changes Too Quickly

I was so excited I finally had an alias. It was so adventurous and so magnificent. If only mother knew about it. I couldn't wait to tell Gwen about it, I hope she accepts it. I checked my phone and saw that I received a message from Gwen saying she needed to see me pronto, and she had to tell me something important. The thing that worried me the most was the fact that she was in the hospital.

At that moment I ran to my closet and threw on some clothes and ran out the door. Not knowing, I realized that I was running faster than usual. I barely paid any attention to the fact that I didn't bother to get my car keys.

My pace continued to increase but I didn't know why. I looked down for a second and realized that my feet weren't touching the ground. At that moment my mother's voice came roaring into my ear.

"Son, there's something I must tell you. When you and your sister turn 21, your bodies are going to have a tremendous change. It is unexplainable. But on that day, please make sure that you are away from people because if you're not you might end up harming someone. And make sure you tell Gwen."

Is this the change she was talking about, I thought. Did she get our birthday wrong or something? I might have to call her as soon as possible so she can straighten some things out for me.

I reached the hospital within five minutes. It would have taken at least half an hour to get here if I drove. I must have had some incredible force pushing me.

After entering the hospital I called Gwen. "What room are you in?"

"Room 746," she replied.

I took the elevator to the seventh floor. When I entered the room I saw a person with bandages on their head. But thankfully I saw that Gwen was sitting right next to the person. She looked as if she had been crying.

I knocked on the door to signal that I was entering. Gwen looked at me and tried to force a smile on her face. I could tell she must have been through a really bad time in the last twenty-four hours. As I stepped closer I realized that it was a man lying in the bed.

"Gwen, are you okay?" I asked.

"I'm alright, just a little shaken up that's all," she replied.

"What happened?" I asked while pointing at the man lying in the bed. As Gwen began to fill me in on what had happened, I couldn't help but notice the sparkling diamond ring on her finger. "Wait a second. Gwen, what is that?"

"This is my engagement ring. My fiancé is lying right there," she said and continued to tell her story.

I was both in shock and happy at the same time. I was shocked because of what had happened to her but I was happy that she was getting married.

When she ended her story, I asked her, "How did you beat up all of your kidnappers?"

A flash of concern went across her face. "I don't know. I thought I was down for the count once the big guy hit me across my back with a metal pole."

"What," I semi-yelled. "Let me see if he hurt you." She turned around and I checked. There were no scars at all. It was as if she miraculously healed herself. "Did anything strange happen."

"No," she lied.

"Gwen, you know that I know when you lie. Your cheek always quivers. So tell me the truth, what happened."

"Well, after the big guy hit me with the pole, I fainted," she said. "Some how I regained consciousness, but that's when all the strange stuff happened. A ring of fire surrounded me and was absorbed by my body. It gave me strength and that might be the reason why my body healed."

"Wow," that was all I can say. "I need to call mother to ask her something."

"Before you go, what was this important thing you were talking about yesterday?"

I thought back and realized she was talking about the text message. "I finally came up with an alias. If you want to see the full costume, come by my house later."

"Well since we're on the topic. There is something I must tell you about mother."

As I listened to Gwen as she explained how mother somewhat lied to me for almost 10 years. From what Gwen has just told me, it seems as if mother was the thief and my father was a policeman who was quite abusive. "How come she didn't just kill him," I asked Gwen, once she finished.

"I think it's because she loved him," she replied.

"Maybe," I said sarcastically. "I will be back later. Love you Gwen. And you might want to go home and take a shower, or do you want me to go to your house and fine an outfit for you? They might let you use the patient's bathroom."

"I might go home to shower. But if I'm not up to it, I will call you to let you know. And I love you too Gigi."

After that, I took my leave. It took me almost three hours to walk back home. But I was glad because the walk gave me a lot of time to think.

As soon as I walked into my house I realized that the door was already open. I searched around my house for about five minutes until I heard a large crash upstairs. I hope that wasn't my priceless vase, I thought.

When I got to the top of my stairs, I realized that it was my vase that fell and I also saw a pair of shoes moving into my closet. It was quite ironic that a thief was getting robbed by another one. When I approached my closet door, I waited a few minutes to see if the person was about to come out. Seeing that the thief wasn't coming out I ran into the closet. As soon as I turned inward to the closet all I heard was the sound of a gun going off. I fell backwards and lay still as my killer stood erect with the gun still in his hand pointing it at the same angle where he had shot me.

### Chapter 6

### The Last Breath of the Old

As I lay there dying, I wondered why this happened. I guess I was never meant to become a known thief. I guess I'm prepared to die an unhappy man.

At that moment when I was sure I was going to die, I heard the voice of my mother. As if she was right beside me, I heard her say, "My sweet little Gigi, I want you to know that you're not going to die unless you are sure about what you're going to do. I set this event up so I can be sure about your plans in life. After finding out about your sister and the fact that she tapped into her powers a little earlier, I decided that it was time to come clean. What she told you at the hospital was true. I did lie to you but that was to protect you. I didn't want you to know everything about our family so I decided to split the family history between both of you. I told her about what truly happened between your father and me, but she didn't know that she would be inheriting a gift. When you wake up from this coma that I put upon you make sure you call me so I could better explain things."

My eyes began to slowly open. I saw the man who shot me. It was Chuck from the costume store.

"Are you okay man," asked Chuck.

"Yea, I'm fine," I replied. "So my mother put you up to this?"

"Yep. She and I go way back," he said. "I think I've known her for about 88 years give or take a few."

In a state of shock I said, "That's not possible. She is only 46. How could you have known her that long?"

Chuck chuckled and said, "Are you sure about that? Just give her a call. Hopefully she'll tell you the truth. And tell her I said, hello." With those last words, Chuck vanished.

"That was odd," I said. Remembering what was said while I was unconscious, I gave my mother a call. She didn't answer her phone. Instead of calling her back to see if she'll pick up. I decided to drive to her house.

Mother lived in the same house for almost my entire life. It only took about an hour to get to her house. I approached the door step and knocked. Seeing that she didn't want to answer her door, I let myself in.

As soon as I opened the door, I almost fell for one of my mothers traps. But something was different this time. Instead of her usual trapdoor routine, she had her entire house set up as a huge booby-trap. On the back of the door she left a note saying:

"If you set off the alarm, your mom will die. She shall be located in her bedroom. You have twenty-two minutes. PS: The time started as soon as you opened the door."

Taking heed of the note I decided to be as careful as possible. There were red lazars going through almost every point in the house. If I was to get to my mother, I would have to dodge all obstacles and try not to trigger the alarm. Looking down at my watch I timed myself. But instead of making it so that my watch started the count down from twenty-two minutes, I set my watch for twenty.

My first obstacle was to pass by the electric saws that traveled along a path on the floor. I was about to jump passed them but a giant pendulum came from the ceiling and a ray of light passed before my eyes. She must have been truly serious about this one, I thought. And where did she find the necessary space for all this stuff?

The pendulum passed over head every five seconds meaning jumping was almost impossible. The circling electric saws were continuously going pass me therefore walking through it was out of the question. The lasers were being fired for each second the pendulum was moving and stopped firing when the pendulum was directly over my head. Therefore the only time I could get pass the first obstacle was to advance forward when the lasers stopped firing for that one second in which the pendulum is over my head. I strategized to see how I could pull that off.

I looked beyond the pendulum to see that there was an open spot on the floor behind my first obstacle. But beyond that, I saw that there were more lasers. Knowing my mother, I know that I have to act fast starting from here on out.

As soon as that split opportunity came I did a jumping summersault landing on the open floor. I then hurried and performed a cartwheel between the red lines and lasers. I quickly ran up the wall, did a back flip to dodge a trick wire, and landed on the stair railing. I ran up the stair railing and jumped back and forth between the railing and the wall to keep from slipping and hitting any red lasers. I reached the top of the stair way and sprinted across the flooring strait toward my mother's room. Each piece of the floor I stepped on soon fell. I saw something sparkle on the ceiling near the entrance to my mother's room. Trying to avoid stepping on a panel that will release what ever it was, I decided to do another jumping summersault but instead of just stopping I decided to kick down my mother's door as well.

As soon as I entered my mother's room the door closed behind me. I looked down at my watch and saw that I still had ten minutes left. I looked around the room and saw another note which said:

"Congratulations on getting this far. If you want to see your mother you'll have to find her. She's in the place where your new life had started. You have 15 minutes to figure it out."

What new life, I thought to myself repeatedly. Seeing that I didn't have enough time to run back down the stairs I decided to jump out the window and see if I can try to run to her location.

I made it to my house within two minutes, thanks to my newly found speed. I searched every room and she was not there. I began to think back. What new life, I thought once more. And then it hit me. I ran down the stairs and rushed toward my store. I thought the note was talking about when Chuck had shot me in the head, but it was actually talking about my new life as a thief.

I reached my store with five minutes remaining. I search for her and found nothing. I thought she might have been in the basement and that's when I found another note which read:

"If you really want to see your mother again, she'll be at the furthest place that you've been to today. This will be the final location. PS: Make sure you bring some clothes from your sister house. You have exactly ten minutes."

I ran as fast as I could go and made it to Gwen's house in two minutes flat. I found an outfit for Gwen to wear and ran out the house after locking her doors. I had 7 minutes to make my way to the final location. The farthest place I had been to today have to have been the hospital.

Once again I ran as fast as I could but this time it felt as if my feet weren't touching the ground. So I looked down for a second to confirm that I was not literally flying but the feeling was right. I was indeed flying. I had about a minute and a half to go when I reached the hospital. At first I was going to take the elevator but that would have taken too long so I ran up seven flights of stairs.

I reached the room where my sister's fiancé had been. I walked in, completely out of breath, to find my mother sitting next to my sister.

### Chapter 7

### Finally the Truth

Giovanni entered the room looking very tired. He was looking at mother with much concern in his eyes. In his hands, there was an outfit.

To break the silence in the room I decided to speak up, "Gigi, how come you look so tired?"

"Why not ask mother," responded Gigi.

I turned and looked at mother and she looked somewhat dumbfounded. "What do you mean? Mother had only come into the room almost a minute before you. So how would she have anything to do with what's going on with you?"

"Why don't you explain it to her mother? Isn't that what you told me you were going to do? There is no more time for lies now. Tell the truth for once."

My mother stood and said, "Okay son, I will. But not here." My mother had then Stood up and walked towards the door. She nudged her head signaling us to follow her. I got up and left the room and entered into some strange world.

"My children," said mother, "I want you two to know that I didn't truly want to lie to you two for so long. I brought you guys here so I can tell you guys the truth." I took a look around and saw that we were in a tropical area. The view was phenomenal. "I know you're wondering where we are, and I will tell you in due time. Gigi, I know I told you that your father, Roberto, was a thief, but that wasn't the full truth. And Gwen I told you he was a policeman, and that wasn't completely the truth. Well the truth is..."

...

"Your father was a schizophrenic. One of his personalities was a policemen and the other was the thief, known as 'Alas preciadas del Ángel', in English it should mean 'the Precious Wings of the Angel'. Mostly all people on your father's side of the family were thieves, a tradition that many of his relatives were proud to hold on to. But my side of the family had a big secret that we kept away from the rest of the human race. We were blessed with gifts, gifts that even the smartest scientist could not begin to describe. This realm that we are in is the same realm that I first visited on my twenty-first birthday. I was told to use it to improve my skills. Gigi that is the reason I wanted you to make sure that you told Gwen to be away from people on your twenty-first birthday. Some how Gwen was able to tap into that power earlier than expected. But I suppose it was because of the great amount of stress she was in last night with those kidnappers."

"Mother, what happened to father," I asked.

"I was getting to that," she continued. "One day, October 20, 1988 to be exact. Your father was on patrol one day and 'The Angel' brought himself forward. Your father lost control of himself. That night the museum had a new Egyptian exhibit. The most precious item was being displayed, the crown jewels of Nefertiti. Your father went to the museum that night and while attempting to escape your father unknowingly jumped across the alley below him and fell from the roof. The impact on the ground was not enough to kill him but he was dazed. When he was once again focused, he was Roberto. The police had soon found the alley and arrested him. When he was charged for his actions he was unable to say that he committed the crimes or that he didn't. His only answer to each charge was that he didn't know. The night that you two were born was the last night anyone had heard of 'The Angel'."

...

I stared at my mother with astonishment. How could she have kept so much from us? Were we that naïve? I could not believe what I was hearing.

"Mother, what was the point in shooting me in the head," Giovanni asked.

"She did what," I yelled.

After a short pause my mother spoke, "To speak with you. I wanted you to think that you were experiencing some psychological translation between the two of us. I couldn't take lying to you any more. Chuck thought it'll be better if I left out the fact I wanted him to do it. But I couldn't."

"Since we're talking about Chuck anyway, who is he? And why did he say he had known you for about eighty years?" Giovanni had a quizzical look in his eyes. "Mother, what if that shot would have killed me?"

After another short pause, my mother sighed and replied, "Chuck is your cousin. And he has known me for eighty years. Chuck is actually ninety-seven and I'm one hundred and twenty-five years old. I knew the shot wouldn't have been enough to kill you because we share the same blood. You didn't wonder how come your sister looked so clean, to be in a brawl with so many people and leave without a scratch? My kind is immortal. Let me rephrase that, 'our' kind is immortal."

Feeling left out of the loop I decided to speak up, "Mother, why are you finally telling us this." At that second someone appeared in the shadows.

"Hello darling," said Mrs. Chambers.

"What are you doing here," I asked. "No, better yet, how did you get here?"

"Hello Great Grandmother," said my mother.

"Great Grandmother," I shouted.

Mrs. Chambers finally spoke, "Well I'm guessing she didn't tell you about me. Well I'm her great grandma, Great Grandma Meredith, but please don't call me that it makes me feel very old."

"But you are," said mother.

I took a good look at mother and Mrs. Chambers and it seemed as if they were getting younger by the second. "Gigi, look at them. Are you seeing what I am seeing?"

"See what," he asked.

"If you really look at them you can see that there getting younger," I replied.

"We are," said mother and Mrs. Chambers.

"See this realm shows our true appearances. We revert back to our true selves. And we look the same as when we did when we were twenty-one years old," said Mrs. Chambers. "In this realm it's hard to believe that I'm over five thousand years old. I've been around for some time now. But I must ask, have your mother asked you what you plan on doing in your near future."

"No she hasn't," said Gigi.

"Well what is it that you two plan on doing," she asked.

Gigi was the first to respond, "I plan on following in my father's foot steps and continue running my music shop."

"And I plan on running my flower shop and marrying my fiancé who is still in his coma," I said.

Mrs. Chambers chuckled and said, "Well Giovanni, that's nice to hear, but remember this: When your sister needs you most, make sure you are there to back her up."

"Why would I need his help," I asked.

"I was getting to that," said Meredith. "I need you to guard this realm. There are many horrible beasts that try their best to conquer these lands. This realm is between the light and the dark. The portal here appears everywhere. When ever a dark place becomes light or vice versa, that instant of change can open a portal. Most people are unaware of the things that are really out there. Gwendolyn, are you willing to follow in your mother's foot steps." I nodded my head in appreciation. "Good. Well your mother shall become your trainer beginning on your twenty-first birthday." After Meredith said those words, I awoke to see Marcus staring at me.

### Chapter 8

### The Good Ole Days

I woke up and saw Gwen fast asleep. She had changed her clothes so I knew she was fine. Even as she sat there she looked just as beautiful as the first time I'd seen her. Her head slowly raised and she looked up to me with a smile.

"Hello Marcus, how you feeling," she asked.

"I feel refreshed, now that I can see your beautiful face again," I said. "When did you change your clothes?"

She looked down and said, "I don't really know. I probably did it when my brother came up here."

"Oh," I responded. "He might have been the other voice I heard when I was out of it."

"Did you dream while you were in your coma?"

"I did," I said as the nurse came in to check up on me. After the nurse left Gwen asked, "What was it about?"

"Something that I had to go through a long time ago..."

...

"I was on my way to investigate a murder case when I got a call. I answered it and it was my mother telling me that my sister was missing. Since I was on duty I had no choice but to go to the crime scene. When I got there, I saw many cars. Many were police cars, and some were random cruising cars.

"When I walked into the house the smell of death rushed into my face and I almost puked. Holding my nose, I brushed forward and talked to one of the officers that were located at the scene. 'What happened here,' I asked. 'A young lady, about twenty-five was murdered. It seems as if she has been here for sometime. Rigor mortis has set in and our scientist predict that she has been here for at least three days,' he replied. I walked forward near the kitchen where the body was found. As I got closer to the body, my surroundings started to become clearer to me.

"I reached the kitchen and there she was, she had blood flowing from her back, her fingertips were absent of any prints, a large knife sticking into her skull, and all the teeth on her lower jaw was missing. Her face was so tremendously beaten there was no way of telling who she was.

"I started to feel depressed because the victim could have been my sister. I turned away and saw one of the people from the lab. 'I need your assistance. Tell me why the victim seems to not have any finger prints,' I asked. 'They were burned off,' he replied, 'well burned isn't the right way to put it. Someone had stuck them in a batch of hydrochloric acid.' I turned towards the body then turned towards the lab worker. 'Can I have permission to examine the body,' I asked and the tech nodded his head in acceptance.

"I put a pair of gloves on and opened the victim's mouth. There was only one way to be sure that she was not my sister. I examined her back teeth and there it was the proof that I needed.

"When I was born, my mother and father placed a chip inside my mouth on my back teeth. There were four different chips. The chips were very peculiar because instead of coming out of my mouth every time I lost a tooth, it stayed. It was as if they really placed the chip on my gums.

"But when I looked inside the girl's mouth, I saw two chips on her bottom jaw. I knew at that moment that the female that was so badly tortured was my sister. I burst out in tears and had a nervous break down. It took five men to hold me down. The only thing I kept saying was, 'that was my sister...I will kill the bastard who has done this to her.'

"After they calmed me down, I told them of my findings and I called my parents to let them know the bad news. My parents were very distraught that they weren't capable of forming words. The only thing I could think about was how I could find the person responsible and what I was going to do to them when I found them.

"The search went on for days, and still we had no evidence. I couldn't take the emotional pain so I quit my job as a police officer. Since I was so determined to find out the murderer, I decided to start my very own detective agency.

"Two days after I opened my agency, I ventured back to the crime scene to see if I could find any evidence that we had missed. I looked everywhere. I went through every room, every cupboard, and every hamper. When I reached the guess-room I started to get a hunch. I opened a drawer and found a diary.

"I turned the page to the dates around my sister death and read. Apparently she was expecting someone to come to her house. I read the next page and it was more detailed. I still remember those words that she had written.

"'Dear Diary,

'August 15, 2003.

'Today I'm going to meet with a stranger from my past. He and my father might have had there differences, but I can see the goodness in everyone. Ever since he had contacted me I thought of him as being quite considerate of others. I don't know why father never talked about him as much. Every time I mention him to my father, he'll get completely defensive, as if he was the spawn of Satan. I believe if my father actually talked to him now, he might have some appreciation for him. They practically grew up together.

'After today I'm going to try my best to rekindle their relationship. I pray that father doesn't continue to disown him. We're all family and you cannot pick and choose who can stay in your family and who has to go. Maybe one day father may come to an understanding. But I guess I might just have to try my best to encourage them to relinquish there petty argumentative ties and convince them to strive to better themselves.

'There goes the door bell. Part 1 of my plan commences today.

'Signed, Julia Rivera.'

"I placed her diary back into her drawer and began contemplating. I tried my best to compare the facts. The killer could have been the guy she was going to see that day but who could it have been. I thought of all the possibilities. That person was someone that my father disowned and the person was a relative of some sort. Who could it have been?

"I left the room and walked into the kitchen. I visualized the way my sister was murdered. She bled from behind; therefore the killer had to have been in her house. Since the front door and back door were in clear view of the kitchen that made my earlier evaluation correct. The killer had to have been her guest.

"I looked under the kitchen cabinet and found nothing that could help me with this case. I then ventured outside to see if I could find anymore clues. I looked in the trash and found nothing there. I looked on the ground near the trash can and found an empty bottle. I examined it and it had some prints on them.

"I enter the kitchen again and noticed something that many of the officers missed. It was as plain as day. Julia was washing dishes before she died. That could have easily been dismissed as any sign of evidence.

"I thought back to the day we found the body. I remembered that all her prints were burned off by hydrochloric acid. I decided to test a new theory that I had. I found a glass cup in one of her cabinets and scooped up some of the water. I poured some on the ground. Some of the liquid splashed on my legs and I was sure that my hypothesis was correct.

"I called my father and asked him about what I found in Julia's diary. He gave me a list of names. There was at least five. Two of the names I was sure were not the criminal because I've seen my father talk to them at times. But the other three were of people I have not heard of for some time. The three were: my aunt Rebecca and her husband Jacob; and my uncle Pearson.

"I went to Julia's room and searched her computer to see if I could find any information. I looked through her history and saw that she did a search on our family. Each page talked about my father. It listed all relatives of my father. And then I found my answer. There was a link at the bottom of the page that was a different color than the rest which meant she had to have clicked on it. The link was entitled 'Complete family tree'. I clicked on it and a window came up. I looked at the names, row to row, column to column. I found a name that was on my list that was in black which meant they had no information about that person.

"I went back to her history and saw that she also searched for a private detective. I found the number that she called to see if they could be of service. To my luck, it was the right number. The good thing is that the detective knew the number and answer by saying, 'Detective Roberts speaking, how may I help you Ms. Rivera?' I told him about the situation and he gave me the name of the person that Julia asked him to find. He had then given me the person's location.

"I drove as fast as I could to the address. I knew exactly how the murder occurred and I now had the suspect. I called for back up and to my surprise we both got there at the same time. We kick down the door and busted him.

"Two days later I had to show up in court to prove to the jury how I came to my conclusion. It was a tough trial but thankfully the jury made the right decision and sent him packing"

...

"Wow that was quite interesting," stated Gwen. "But if you don't mind me asking, who was the murderer?"

I sighed and waited to reply, "It was someone that I least expected. I thought it was my uncle Pearson but it seems that he and my father got over there differences a long time ago. His name was the one that was black but that was because no one actually knew who he was. But the killer turned out to be my aunt's husband Jacob."

"How did he do it," asked Gwen.

"Please tell. I must know," said the nurse. I would have never known she was in the room if she had never said anything. Apparently I must have went off to my own world while I was telling my story. I looked at my surroundings and saw that the nurse wasn't the only extra person that was in the room. My physician, his assistant and two interns were all in the room.

"When did you guys get into the room? Never mind. Back to the story...Jacob had planned everything out. He put the hydrochloric acid inside the sink knowing that she was about to wash the dishes. She invited him over for lunch to be friendly. About three years before his conviction, Jacob was said to have killed Rebecca for her money, not knowing that she had made him sign a prenuptial agreement. It turns out that he really did kill her but somehow he convinced the jury that he hadn't. After that day mostly all of my family turned there back on him. On the day of Julia's death when Julia began washing the dishes, the water burned off all traces of her finger prints. She screamed in pain and her neighbor saw through her window and just thought the water was too hot or something. While she was screaming, Jacob came behind her and literally stabbed her in the back. She started to call for help and he stabbed her in her trachea to shut her up. He had then left the house out the back door not knowing that he accidentally dropped the bottle that had the hydrochloric acid in it."

"Oh my," said Gwen, "that was some story, Marcus."

"I know. But ever since that day I had never let a case go unsolved," I replied.

After everyone left, Gwen decided that she had to go home and let me get so sleep. The only thing that is troubling me is what will happen to me if I'm left alone for way too long.

### Chapter 9

### Party Until You Die

I decided to move the date of the party up. I thought it'll be better to have the party the day before my birthday. Gwen provided the flowers and I provided the musical entertainment. This year Gwen said she was going to have a flower show. She had many plants that were still budding. She said that at exactly 12 o'clock, the buds were going to open revealing the most extravagant arrangement of flowers ever.

I decided to dress up like Tuxedo Mask, from the Japanese comic 'Sailor moon'. And she decided to dress up as one of the sailor scouts. I believe she said Sailor Mercury. Even though we came up with our costume choices at the last minute, somehow we always managed to steal the spotlight. To me many other people's costumes surpassed mine yet I don't believe they were appreciated.

Somehow I hadn't had to experience the common 'party-wait', when you're waiting for about an hour or two for your guest to arrive. I'm going to open the doors at 8 o'clock to let people in. But this year I'm going to have a huge surprise for everyone. Gwen might get mad at me because I hadn't told her about it but she'll get over it.

After Gwen's flower show, I plan on having one of the scariest haunted houses ever. Blood flowing down the stairs, nonpoisonous snakes and spiders will be let out across the floor, and my favorite, trained bats will be let loose. That will be one heck of a way to clear everyone from the house, but the only down fall will be the clean up.

"Two more hours until the party," I thought. I needed to make some finishing touches for my plan. Gwen would be here any minute so I must hurry.

When Gwen arrived, I helped her carry her flowers into the house. She asked me to place them somewhere cold. I put them inside a walk in freezer that I rarely used. Gwen was so exited it seemed. She told me at an earlier time that I was going to finally meet her fiancé. She also told me that he is going to surprise us both when he arrives. I truly don't understand why he would want to surprise me but who cares.

After Gwen and I finished putting on our costumes it was time for the party to begin. I opened the door and all of the party goers entered. In a short period of time the room was full of friends of both Gwen and I. We partied and partied. Around 9:30, Gwen's fiancé Marcus showed up. He had on a great costume I must say. It looked as if he was actually shining.

He reached me and Gwen and said, "Surprise! The thing that I wanted to surprise you guys with is outside right now."

All three of us left for the door. To my surprise, Marcus had bought Gwen and me matching motorcycles. Gwen's motorcycle was a pure glassy white color and mine was a very dark blue. I was really shocked at the gifts. It was as if he really knew me.

"Thanks a lot Marcus," Gwen and I said as if in harmony.

"No problem," he replied.

"Well, let me be the first to say, welcome to the family," I said proudly. "I will be proud to call you my brother-in-law."

Gwen giggled, "Well, shall we go back inside?"

We retreated back into the house where the party was. We dance for a little while and then the clock struck signaling that it was 11:30. Gwen and I calmed everyone down so we can present the flower show. As Gwen had planned, when the clock struck twelve the orchids began to sprout.

It truly was an amazing thing to see. But after the flower show I decided to end the party. "Hello everyone," I started, "I'm standing up here to wish all of you a happy Halloween and a safe journey home. If I may, Gwen and Marcus, can you please come up here and stand right next to me." They walked forward and did as I suggested. "Friends, I'm happy that you all were able to make it. But with all means of respect I must inform you that the party has yet begun." Everyone began to applaud. "With further adieu, I wish for you all to have a graceful night now let's get this party started!" As soon as I said that I pressed a button to set my plan into action. As I planned, everyone ran away in terror. I couldn't help but laugh. To my surprise, neither Gwen nor Marcus exited the room.

"I should have known you were going to pull something like that," said Gwen. "That's why we always have the best Halloween parties ever!" We both slapped five and went on our way.

She had a point; we do have the best Halloween parties. But I wonder what I'm going to do for next year.

### Chapter 10

### A Disappearing Act

Giovanni has one funny since of humor, I thought to myself. I was surprised that he would end the party like that. It was hilarious watching all our friends run in fear. He's going to have one heck of a mess to clean up.

I was driving home on my new motorcycle that Marcus had bought me. If I would've known he was going to get me this. I wouldn't have driven over to Gigi's house. I was quite surprised at how well I was driving. I'd only had two experiences in which I've driven a motorcycle.

I was to meet Marcus a little later but I think he will be okay for now. I might drive for an hour or so to break the motorcycle in.

...

I arrived at Marcus's house at two o'clock, as planned. He was on his couch waiting for me. He had popped some popcorn for the two of us. He had rented some horror movies for us to watch. I told him that I rarely get scared when I watch these things because they're so predictable.

I walked toward the couch and sat right beside him. The popcorn was fresh. I grabbed a few and fed it to him. And he did the same to me. He pressed play on his DVD player and I heard a scream. That was somewhat unexpected.

Halfway threw the movie Marcus began to yawn. Either he was sleepy or he didn't enjoy the movie. He yawned once more so I asked, "Marcus, are you tired? Or is this movie that boring?"

"To be honest," he started, "it's a little bit of both."

I got the remote out of his hands and turned the movie and the television off. I walked him to his room afterwards. "Can you stay with me tonight," he asked.

"Are you scared," I asked jokingly. He chuckled. "I guess I can. Just so I can make sure you're safe from monsters."

I got into the bed next to him. He wrapped his arms around my waste and kissed me. Marcus was truly different from any other man that I've dated. Instead of sex he gave me something that seemed more important. He gave me complete and total intimacy. Most guys would have jumped off a bridge to get with me. I'd known since the day I had first saw him that he would be different.

...

Daylight glared through the window and had awakened me from my peaceful dream. I rose out of Marcus's bed to see that it was 9:25. Marcus was still resting in bed. He looked so handsome while sleeping. My mother once told me that if you cannot appreciate what and whom you awake with, then you better have had a mental problem or some strong alcohol in your system to have had them in your presents to begin with.

I decided to take a walk around the house to think about life. I got out of bed and began walking towards the door. I opened the door and turned around to close it so that it didn't make a loud enough noise to wake Marcus. Once I closed the door I turned around to see my mother staring at me.

I was once again in that realm. I turned around and saw Gigi looking at me as well. The door was no longer there. It was as if I was never at Marcus's house to begin with.

They continued to stare at me so I asked, "What are you guys looking at?" In unison Giovanni and my mother both pointed downward. I looked down to see that I wasn't wearing any pants, just a top and underwear. "I'm so embarrassed. Please tell me you have some clothes mother."

"As a matter of fact, I do," she replied. "I have some for you too Giovanni."

She reached out her hands and two outfits appeared. She handed one of them to both of us and said, "These uniforms represent your abilities." I looked at my suit and it was a very dark red with a bright red strip going down both sides. Gigi's was the same except his was a very dark blue with a very bright sky bluish color going down its sides. "For Gwen," she continued, "red. It represents strength and the never surrendering light. And Giovanni, you have blue, which is flamboyant and lucid. It flows smoothly just as wind and water does."

"Mother why are we here," asked Giovanni.

"I was getting to that," she replied. "Your five year training starts today—"

"Five years," I questioned with astonishment. "What about our lives in the human world mother! What about the facts that I'm suppose to get married?"

She cleared her throat, "Maybe if you stop interrupting, I might be able to tell you." My mother had then repositioned herself. "The flow of time is altered in this realm. Time goes past much faster here then it does on Earth. During the five year period you two will learn how to master your abilities. You'll learn how to control your energy flow and you'll learn how to defeat the savage monsters that come to this world. Your training will begin now."

### Chapter 11

### Training for Destiny

The first twenty months, Gigi and I both worked on our main powers. Mother told us that our powers will unlock themselves gradually as we prosper in our training. At the end of our first twenty months, I mastered my power over fire and Giovanni mastered his power over wind. Our training was vigorous. We had to search high and low for a thing that goes by the name of "Elementum Vox" and from my knowledge of Latin; I believe it means "Elemental Power". Mother said that we wouldn't be able to find it unless we're truly connected with our powers.

During my second twenty months my brother and I finally unlocked our next level to our powers. Giovanni's new ability was to manipulate water and mine was the power over earth. We had to once again search for yet another Elementum Vox. I found mine in a cave in which I had created to escape the outside world. As for Gigi, he found his in a pond that he had created for relaxation. Mother appeared before us both simultaneously to inform us that our final twenty months will be coming to an end. She also told us that we had one more ability to master. It was said to be a mixture between the powers that we possess. The last thing she'd told us is that we'll have to figure that power out on our own and all ways of communicating will be halted until the end of our third twenty month time period.

Today was the last day for me to find my final Elementum Vox. I discovered that when I mix my two abilities together and time the reaction right, I can produce metal. But that wasn't all that I needed to find out because if it was, I would have been able to master my powers by now.

I decided to think about all possible things that I could do with my powers. Out of anger I punched the grounds. The task of conquering my abilities was finally pressing down on me because I had a certain amount of time to master my abilities.

I looked down at the sand that was in my hands. I screamed at the top of my longs. "Why must this be so aggravating? I made steel for goodness sake, what more can I do?" As I continued to yell the ground below me began to shake. "As if I hadn't tried my best," I continued to yell. "What good is it to have these abilities if you can't truly master them? If I had some way to contact Giovanni, I bet he would have mastered all of his abilities." I felt steam rise up behind me. I looked at the dirt that was once in my hand and found that it was no longer there. Instead of dirt I found a diamond. I turned around to see where the steam was coming from and saw that I'd created my very own volcano.

I saw something glistening inside the lava and decided to retrieve it. I thought about how the diamond appeared in my hand which brought about a brilliant decision. A diamond is made by subduing molecules of dirt under a large amount of heat and pressure. I called for dirt to cover my entire body. My first layer of protection from the immense heat of the volcano was a steel coat. And my final layer was made of diamond.

I forced myself to jump into the burning lava to retrieve the glistening item which to my eyes somewhat resembled an Elementum Vox. The lava began to tear my outer layers apart one by one. By the time I reached the Elementum Vox I noticed that my layers were completely burned away, yet I survived. I should have realized that since I've mastered my power over fire, it would no longer burn me. Once I grabbed the Elementum Vox I some how was back at the mouth of the volcano. I looked down at my hand to see them glowing red. The volcano that I created somehow lowered to the ground and disappeared. All of the images around me began to get blurry and fade away. It was as if two realities were beginning to mix themselves. I turned around and saw that I was in the same spot that I was in when my mother brought Gigi and I to this world the first time. I turned back around and got the surprise of my life.

...

I saw Giovanni wearing a blue robe standing on a huge bolder with a face that spoke of great dignity and responsibility. As I looked at him, the ground beneath my feet began to rise but this time without me manipulating it in any way.

I was now eye level to Gigi. "Giovanni, what's up with the robe?"

"I was going to ask you the same thing," he replied. I looked down and saw that I was wearing a red robe. It actually looked stylish but it wasn't for me at all.

"Hello, my children," said mother and Mrs. Chambers in unison.

"You two are now officially guardians of this realm," said mother. "You, Giovanni, have conquered all of your abilities, the power over water, wind, ice, and thunder. As for you, Gwendolyn, you've conquered all of your abilities as well, your power to manipulate fire, earth, metal, and crystal. From this day forward we are equals in this world."

"Mother not to seem as if I'm not grateful," I said, "when do I get to leave because I truly miss Marcus?"

"You shall leave momentarily," said Mrs. Chambers. "There are some things I must talk to you about. Gwen, you musn't let your guard down at anytime because you are foremost the guardian of this realm. And Gigi, whenever your sister may call you do not feel as if the tasks at hand are not important. If you are in the middle of an important heist and Gwen needs your help, you must come to her rescue."

"I understand," Giovanni and I stated in unison.

"But I have a question," continued Gigi, "What is the name of this realm?"

"Oh I'm so sorry," said mother, "I cannot believe I forgot to tell you two the name of this realm. It is Ayeguam. And Gwendolyn, I will not be sending you and your brother home this time. You must discover how to get back on your own. To be completely honest, you should know how to get home. I believe it is called instinct."

At that moment my mother and Mrs. Chambers left. I thought about it for a while and looked over at Gigi. As soon as I looked over at him he too disappeared. I decided to concentrate on all that my mother has told me. She said that I know how to return home based on instinct.

I closed my eyes and when I opened them I was in Marcus's room. In the exact spot I was standing in before I went off to improve my skills. Marcus was still in his bed sleeping. I looked at the clock and realized that only ten minutes had passed since I had left.

### Chapter 12

### Infiltrating the Enemy

Now that I was done with my training to become a guardian, now I can prepare my first heist. I planned to do something that is quite easy. My plan was put into effect last night. The only thing left for me to do was to put everything into action.

I drove to Chuck's shop so I could pick up a costume that I had preordered. It was a policeman's uniform. I was going to pose as a policeman for a while, in order to do that I needed to have a uniform.

I had my alias covered. I was posing as a NYPD transfer officer. I was practicing law enforcement since I was sixteen. I was awarded five metals of duty by the age of nineteen. And to put at least one drastic measure into my phony transfer papers, I added that my 'chief' was transferring me because my longtime best friend and partner had been shot in a cross fire between myself and many gang members. For a final touch I put that the 'Chief' thought it would have been better for me to be away from New York or it might cause some psychological problems and affect my job performance.

Everything was going as planned. I was expected to arrive at the station at two o'clock. I was to be welcomed by no more than ten police officers, which made it so much better for me to go through with by plan.

I drove to Mrs. Chambers's mask shop and picked up a special mask that I ordered. It was a fake face; well it was someone's face but just not mine. I had thirty more minutes to get to the police station, more time than I actually needed.

...

I arrived at the precinct, about a block away from it to be exact. My plan was going perfectly. The ten police officers were outside waiting on my arrival. A few of them turned my way wondering why I was walking instead of taking a cab and I waved at them yelling, "Sorry guys. The cab driver had to drop me off down the street because I didn't have enough money for the fare."

Seeing how they all had their attentions set on me I decided to move one to the second phase of my plan. I froze time for a while and ran to the top of the building. Noting exactly where I was standing, I threw a bottle that had a letter on the inside. So the bottle wouldn't fall I placed it in the suspended reality as well. I then ran back to where I was standing and unfroze time. The bottle began to sway away from the designated fall point so I had to manipulate the wind a little. The bottle had then struck me across my head and I fainted while many of the officers rushed to aid me.

My plan was going just as I planned. I had a little bit of blood flowing down my forehead once the officers arrived. I falsely regained consciousness and pointed to the top of the building yelling, "That's the guy who'd thrown the bottle! I'm okay, get him dammit!" As they turned to see what I was pointing at, I once again froze time and ran to the top of the building. I unfroze time and made a hasty escape with five police officers running towards the building. I had then frozen time once more to return to my position on the ground.

"Are you okay," asked a female police officer.

"I'm swell," I said with sarcasm. I looked around the ground and found a letter and asked, "What's this here, a love letter on my first day?" I opened the letter and faked an astonished face. With seriousness I said, "I must speak with the chief."

It was then time to move on to my final phase. Now reaching the chiefs door which read "Head Chief of the Georgia State Police Office Commander Williams", I realize that there is no turning back, as if I would want to.

I knocked on Commander Williams' door and heard a husky voice say, "Come in."

"Hello Commander," I said clearing my throat. "I'm DeAngelo Glen Mauntrice, I was sent here from New York."

The chief looked up with excitement. His excitement soon turned into dismay. "My boy, what has happened to you? Did you get into a brawl or something? I'm sorry that your first day here has been so traumatic."

"I'm okay sir," I started, "It's nothing but a scratch. I heal quickly anyways." Reaching into my pocket I said, "Sir, I'm actually worried about you. Upon my arrival I was hit in the head by a bottle. The bottle had this note within it." I handed him the note.

He began to read the note aloud:

"Dear Commander Williams, It is with great honor for me to write to such a man of your stature. I've heard through the grape vine that you are a man that is not to be trifled with. To me those words are nothing but a challenge. It is as if you are challenging me to a duel, a duel that I shall win. Be prepared for I shall steal your heart on tomorrow's night, at the stroke of midnight. Yours Truly, Phantom Keys."

### Chapter 13

### Never Dying Trust

I woke up to the smell of bacon cooking on the stove. I got out of bed and put on my house shoes. I walked toward the smell of food. When I walked into the kitchen I saw Gwen standing over the stove cooking. She looked magnificent. I had never tasted Gwen's cooking before. I hope she knows how.

"Breakfast should be ready in about three minutes Marcus," said Gwen. "You should go wash up."

I did just as she asked. When I reentered the kitchen, I saw the most wonderful arrangement of food. Gwen had cooked scrambled eggs, bacon, pan cakes with fruit and syrup, oatmeal, and to complement the meal, Gwen poured me a glass of milk and a glass orange juice.

"Gwen, this looks magnificent," I stated in awe. "I had no idea that you knew how to cook."

"Of course I know how to cook. I have to do something when I get bored." She grinned and sat down across from me. "It looks as if you don't cook that often. Or do you clean up your kitchen very often?"

"I cook when I have time," I said. "But I'm grateful of the compliment. I rarely have time to clean up my house so I hired a butler. He comes and goes when ever he pleases. That might be the reason I hired him."

"Oh, that is interesting. Do you enjoy having a butler to take care of your home?"

"In a way I do. I enjoy the helping hand but I've always been independent while growing up, even though my parents wanted me to be one of those children who waited for their inheritance. Having a butler sort of takes away some of that independence because I don't get the chance to clean up my own home."

"How come you keep him around then?"

That question was unexpected. I had never thought of that before. "Well...I really don't know. It might be because he does a nice job."

She then smirked at me, "Well as long as I don't have to fight for your attention, I guess all is well."

Catching on to her joke I replied, "No need to worry about that. You will have mostly all of my attention."

"Mostly," she asked quizzically.

"Someof my attention needs to go towards work," I had then looked at the kitchen clock which read 9:45 am. "Speaking of work, I have to get ready to go to the office." On that note, we finished our breakfast, jumped in the shower, got dressed, and left my house heading in opposite directions.

I arrived at the office and saw that I had a client waiting. I hurried to open the door so that my client wouldn't leave. When I unlocked the door, I entered and awaited for my client to enter. He took his time and paid close attention to the cars that passed him by. When he had finally got up the nerve to come into the office, he ran as fast as he could.

"Is this Rivera's Detective Agency," asked the man. He looked frightened. He had on a black suit and was looking slightly pale.

"Yes sir," I answered, "how may I help you?"

"My nephew has been kidnapped," said the man. "I was too scared to come see you because the kidnappers left a note saying that if I didn't pay them the sum of thirteen million dollars, they were going to kill him."

"When are you suppose to deliver the money?"

"The note said within forty-eight hours and they are suppose to send me a drop-off location today at one o'clock. I have been to the police and they said they'll do as much as they can to find the culprits. The police have no leads at the time that's why I decided to come to you."

"Well sir, I feel honored that you chose me to help you in your time of crisis. I would gladly assist you in finding the persons responsible."

"Thank you sir. He is very special to me. His parents died in a car wreck a few years back and I have no clue what I would do if I lost him."

"I understand sir. Can you fill out these sheets of paper with your information?" He did as I said and quickly ran back to his vehicle.

...

"Gwen," I began while talking into my cellular phone, "I have a big case today and I'll call you when I get back in."

"Okay," she replied, "make sure you stay safe. I love you."

"I love you too," I said before hanging up.

I was on my way to my client's, Mr. Smith, house. He called me and told me that the kidnappers gave him a location. I gave my old boss, Commander Williams, a call to inform him where the transaction is said to be taking place. He said that he'll be sending four of his best men over to the location.

I arrived at Mr. Smith's house. His vehicle was parked in front so I new he was in the house. He left me an earlier message saying that once I arrived the door would be unlocked and I could enter.

I entered his house to find a scared Mr. Smith hiding behind a sofa sitting in fetal position. The kidnapping must have both made him paranoid and scared for his life.

"Mr. Smith," I said calmly, "It is me, Marcus Rivera. Please come from behind the couch. I need you to be brave for your nephew. The police have sent some of their best men to the location to snoop around the area; everything's going to be okay. So can you please come from behind the sofa?" After calming down, Mr. Smith came from behind the sofa. "Thanks. Mr. Smith do you have the ransom money? We have to leave quickly because it's almost time for the drop-off."

Mr. Smith hurried to his closet door and retrieved a brief case and a slip of paper. With no haste, Mr. Smith fled to the vehicle.

Once I entered the vehicle Mr. Smith gave me a slip of paper. "This arrived in the mail today," he said. "The location I gave you was to a mansion. It seems that the kidnappers are having some sort of formal party. They said that I was to arrive with the brief case and they were going to release my nephew Kevin once they've retrieved the brief case. In the letter they said that I had to leave the brief case with the doorman and he was going to put it with the hats and coats. I'm guessing that they wanted me to contact the police because on the invitation it says that I could bring another guest."

I sent word to the Commander and he said that he had a plan for that. We arrived shortly after the event began. It was being held at some old mansion that apparently no one lived in. We did as they had instructed. The doorman didn't ask us for our name nor did he ask to see our invitations so we walked into the dining room which had no more than fifteen people in it. I looked around the mansion to see if I could spot any suspicious characters.

At that moment, all of the lights went out. There was a sound of glass breaking, a rumbling noise that came from above along with a crash through the window, and I turned and saw a glistening light in front of me. Then the lights came back on. I heard a piercing scream from a woman. I turned towards the front of the dining room and saw Mr. Smith murdered.

...

I heard foot steps coming from the stairs. It was one of the police officers sent by Commander Smith, holding a boy in his arms that looked no older than seventeen. "State your name officer," I said.

"My name is officer Mauntrice," said the officer. "I noticed a shadow in a bed room upstairs. When the power went out I heard a crash and enter the window and found this boy tied up in ropes. I believe that this is the child that was kidnapped."

"What is your name," I asked the child while dismissing the officer.

"My name is Kevin Smith.," answered the boy. "Well my last name was Henderson but it was changed once my uncle adopted me. Where is my uncle," he asked with fear in his voice. He looked toward the dining room, where there was a lot of mumbling. The boy ran into the room and fell out crying.

I looked around and found the officer who brought the boy, "Officer Mauntrice, get that boy out of here. Take him to the precinct. And on your way there, get a forensics team out here stat!"

"Okay," replied Mauntrice. There was something about that guy that seemed familiar. He had a look that seemed close to someone that I knew. It is as if this was not our first time meeting.

I turned my focus back to the crime scene, "People, you must not panic. You are not to leave this mansion because this is a crime scene and you are all suspects."

"What do you mean dude," said a young looking man. "We aint did nothing wrong!"

"I'm sorry," I continued, "but as far as I know any one of you could have pulled this stunt. You will all be interrogated through out the night."

I had then looked over and found another police officer, "Can you call officer Mauntrice and tell him that he should bring the boy back here immediately. Tell him that I was not thinking straight and that I was being a little too emotional."

The officer nodded his head and did as I instructed. A few minutes later Mauntrice arrived with the boy at his side. The forensics team arrived shortly afterward.

I gave them their time to examine the body and once they'd finished I took my chance at examining it. All of the party goers were being interrogated one by one in the room next door. So far all of them had the same alibi. Somehow they were invited to the house for a get together and were asked to bring someone along with them. The only thing that the suspects had in common was the fact that each person was a member of a rival company. It seems that Mr. Smith bought off many of the party goers companies and they lost their jobs. That was a clear motive for murder but no one admitted that they had a grudge against him.

After examining the body I say that there was a deep penetration in Mr. Smiths's body. The thing that yanked him across the room had to be near. With clearance from the forensics team, I moved the body to search behind it. His body didn't move much. It was as if he was still being pulled by something.

I thought about what I saw when the light was off. That glistening light could have been the object that yanked Mr. Smith back. It had to have been something metallic and sharp. Seeing that completely moving the body was pointless I found another way to find out how this could have happened.

I put my ear to the wall and heard the sound of an engine. I punched the wall and revealed some type of pulley system. I whistled for back up. Two techs and Mauntrice came running to see what I had discovered. The pulley system was jammed somehow. It seems as though it was strong enough to pull Mr. Smith backwards yet it was not strong enough to yank him into the wall or at least yak his spin out of his body.

With great skill, one of the techs was able to stop the pulley from spinning. The cord that held Mr. Smith body was soon loose. And Mr. Smith's body fell.

I maneuvered the projectile from around his spin and found a chip connected to it. Next to the chip was a button that was at one time attached to Mr. Smith's shirt.

Letting the techs examine the button, I ran to speak with the doorman. Apparently the doorman was already interrogated. He said that he didn't know the person who had hired him. He just showed up and followed their request. He was told to get the brief case from Mr. Smith once he had arrived and place it in the back room. He was also told to place the brief case in a certain spot so the owner could find it easily and the spot was going to be outlined with the letter 'X'.

I then ran towards the room where the brief case was held. To my dismay it wasn't there. I walked forward to see if I could find the letter 'X' but did not see it. I took another step and the floor made a sound. I brought myself eye level with the floor and saw that there was a crease in it. I slid one of my keys between the creases and was able to remove the board and there it was...the brief case.

"Everyone," I yelled, "Step away from the body! Move towards the side of the room! I need someone to shine a flashlight onto the body and another flash light on the hook! I'm about to test a theory! Turn on your flash lights now and what ever you do, do not take your eyes or the flashlight off the body and hook!"

I waited for a few seconds, I lifted the brief case and the floor began to rise revealing the 'X'. "Mauntrice," I started, "hold on to the boy, I don't want him to get hurt!" I placed the brief case back over the 'X '. The brief case slowly sank down into the floor and then the lights went off. I heard a boom from the next room and stood erect, and at that moment the light came back on.

"What happened," I asked the officers. They were all gaping at the body. I looked at it and saw that it was once again sitting in the same position as before, back against the wall and not falling. As I had expected, the pulley system was once again turned on.

"Sir," said one of the techs, "somehow the machine turned back on. It moved as if it was alive...as if it were a snake. It shot out from the wall and went directly into the victim's body and yanked him back. It was a breath taking sight."

"Thanks for the update," I replied. "I'm suppose that you all are wondering why I asked you to do this but it is quite easy to explain. Someone please turn off the machine and remove the hook." I paused in my speech while they performed the task. "What is different about the hook now?" They all gave me quizzical look. "If you pay close attention to the hook you'll see a chip. And next to the chip you'll find a button."

"But there are two on here sir," said a confused forensics worker.

"My point exactly. When I examined the hook the first time there was only one button but somehow there are two now. We all know that Mr. Smith was a technical genius, but not so many people know of his next invention. Most of his inventions were made to help the world, yet some person found a way to make one of them harmful."

"So are you saying that this is one of his inventions," asked Mauntrice.

"Exactly. His new invention was going to revolutionized police work, well on some cases. He made a device that will seek out a missing child. It was a double invention; it was both a locator and a finder. It was based upon a hide-and-go-seek method if you will. He would place the finder chip into a saucer and it'll seek out the locator chip. But the finder chip and locator chip had a set polarity to them to aid in searching. For instance, if a child was kidnapped and had a locator chip embedded in them, the finder chip will seek it out. The finder chip would give you the coordinance to the location of the child, but the finder never came in contact with the locator. It's kind of complicated."

"So what does the invention have to do with this," asked a tech.

"I'm glad you asked. See, someone in this room new of this invention. He tampered with the invention and reversed the polarization of the finder chip and locator chip. After reversing the polarization, the culprit had then placed a locator chip in all of the buttons on Mr. Smith's jacket and placed a finder chip on the end of this hook. Knowing that the finder chip on the hook would go to the end of the earth to find the locator, the culprit attached the hook to this machine. The hook was suppose to yank out of the victim and retreat into the wall where it would have been hidden. Unknowingly, Mr. Smith's paranoia took complete control, and he tried to flee once the lights went out, but the hook caught him before he was able to go anywhere.

"With that being said, I must say that this crime would have been almost perfect if your uncle wouldn't have tried to flee, am I right Kevin?" Everyone turned there heads in the direction of Kevin. "You are the murderer are you not? You would have been long gone by now if I would have let Mauntrice take you to the precinct. But Kevin there is one thing I have to know, why did you do it?"

Kevin gave off a devilish smirk, "I had to get rid of him before got rid of me."

"What do you mean by that," I asked.

"A few days ago I overheard my uncle talking on the phone. I heard him say these words exactly, 'I'm tired of all this foolishness. I have to let him go. He is too lazy and does nothing productive. I took him in as a favor from you but I can't deal with this nonsense any longer. Either you do something about it or I will!' I heard every word. He was planning to get rid of me. He—"

At that moment a woman came up and slapped him directly across his face. Her name was Martha Dixon. "Is that the reason you killed the only person who truly cared for you," she yelled. "He was not going to get rid of you! I was the person on the other side of the phone. He was going to fire my son. He was calling me to inform me of his decision. Do you not know that this man would have given up everything for you," tears began to roll down her face, "he loved you as if you were hi own son." Her words seemed to have pierced him in the heart. "He came up with the concept of the finder and locator chips because he didn't want anything to happen to you. Yet you used something that was meant to save lives and changed it into a murder weapon. I hope you feel ashamed of yourself. Do you think he would have tried his best to come and save you if he didn't truly care for you? I feel sorry for you; you aren't even worth the anger and frustration. You are nothing but a common dog's shit and I pity you."

Kevin began to tear up and repeatedly moaned, "I didn't know...I didn't know." Another crime solved but at the cost of one peaceful soul.

### Chapter 14

### Hard Act to Follow

Who would have known being a policeman would be so exciting. It's kind of funny how none of the techs thought about moving the body. Marcus surely did have a lot of skills, no wonder my sister chose him. Yet he hasn't found out who I really am which is a good thing.

I would have never expected that that young boy would do something like that. When I was driving him to the precinct earlier he was crying about how much his uncle had meant to him. That goes to show you that even young adults can be manipulative.

I got back to the precinct with Kevin in cuffs. Most of the officers looked at him as if he was innocent. I was still playing my role as a police officer so I couldn't just let the boy go. Plus, I don't really support violence unless it is necessary. This entire conflict could have been solved if Kevin would have spoken to his uncle about what he accidentally overheard.

After putting Kevin in a holding cell, I was asked to see the chief. He was all shaken up about the note from earlier.

"You wanted to see me," I asked after entering the chief's door.

"Sit down," said Commander Williams. "I know this is your first day here and all, and seeing how you have not been assigned a partner, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind working on a special assignment for me. I need you to be here tomorrow at midnight. I'm going to have several guards outside the building and on the inside of the building, but I need someone to be at my side the entire time. Do you, by chance, think you could be that person?"

He was unknowingly falling into my trap. He doesn't even know half of what I'm planning to do, "Well sir, I am very honored that you chose me. But seeing that I had a rough day today, I might have to think about it."

The chief's eyebrows went up, "I understand. But let me remind you that the person coming after me is the same person who hit you in the head with a bottle."

"Well," I started, "since you put it that way, I accept your proposal. I shall guard you with my life." How sorry can you get? If I would have known things would have been this easy, I would have robbed a bank instead. The game has yet to begin; you will find another surprise when you get home.

### Chapter 15

### A Letter to the Wife

Commander Williams was driving home. The only thing that was on his mind was the safety of his family. Was his kids okay, was his wife safe, these questions kept coming back no matter how hard he tried to rid them from his thoughts.

He reached his driveway and ran towards his door. The lights were out. He began to panic. He hurried and unlocked his door. He looked around and there was no one in sight. A light flickered on upstairs in one of the bedrooms. With his hand on his gun, he cautiously walked up the stairs ready to gun down any intruder. He got to the bedroom that had the light turned on and noticed it was his room. He opened the door to see his wife with tears running down her face.

"What's wrong," he asked. "Did someone try to hurt you or one of the kids? Are you okay?"

She looked up, "I'm fine. But I am worried about you. This letter flew into the window a few minutes before you enter. Honey, what's going on," she asked as she handed him the note.

He began to read the letter:

"Dear Commander Williams, I'm writing to you to inform you that I do not want to see your wife at the police station tomorrow. It wouldn't feel right stealing your heart from you with your wife at the precinct. I won't feel right doing any dirty work with someone so special to you present. And it would also seem sort of cliché to do such a deed in front of a woman of her stature. Yours truly, Phantom Keys."

"Honey, what does this mean," asked the commander's wife.

"Just don't go to the precinct tomorrow," he replied.

"But in the note, it said that he wouldn't do anything with me present."

"I know that. But what would make you think that he wouldn't. I want you to stay here, safe from harm. If he is truly going to kill me, we need at least one parent here to watch over the kids."

"I understand dear. But—"

"No buts. Rest your pretty little head. And I don't want to hear no more of this talk about you going to the precinct."

The chief had then washed off and went to sleep next to her. He was unaware of what his wife was planning on doing. In her mind, she did not see it worthy of raising a family without her husband. She made it her goal to be at the precinct tomorrow no matter what her husband said.

### Chapter 16

### How to Steal a Heart

The heist was to occur in a few hours. Somehow, almost every news broadcaster in the state heard about the heist. Well the name of Phantom Keys had to get out there somehow so I sent a few more letters out.

The chief asked mostly all of his police officers to stand guard. He was truly scared for his life. I was standing right by his side informing him what time it was. With every minute that passed, the chief looked at the clock and asked me for the time.

We had ten more minutes before show time and suddenly the chief's wife came bursting through the door. "What are you doing here," yelled the commander. "I thought I made it perfectly clear that you were to remain home."

"I couldn't let you be killed," she replied. "I love you too much to let that happen."

"Do you want me to escort her out sir," I asked, knowing that the chief was going to fall for yet another one of my traps.

"No," he replied, just as I expected. "I need you to stand guard. I don't want you to get distracted from your duties by dealing with 'this woman' and her foolishness"

"This woman," she snapped back. "'This woman' is your wife. And I'm so sorry that you see my wanting to save your damn life is foolishness! Do you not know how much I care for you? I went out on a limb to save you and this is how you repay me. I have a question for you, Mr. Boss man."

"Sir, it wouldn't take me much hassle to remove her," I said to ease the tension until it was time for my plan to commence.

"Stay out of this," he said to me, "I shall handle this hussy." Unknowing, Commander Williams was falling further into my scheme.

"Who are you calling a hussy," asked Mrs. Williams.

"You," he yelled from the top of his longs. "Just ask you foolish question and get out!"

"Do you truly love me," she asked. "Do you love me the same way I love you?"

The question caught him off guard. Before he could answer all of the lights in the precinct went off and I commenced with my plan.

I ran to the top of the building to perform a daring escape for the news broadcasters so they'll have some good photage to show on tomorrow's news. I had then made my way back into the commander's office and then the light came back on.

"What happened," I asked as if I didn't know.

"I have no clue," replied the commander. "I'm still alive."

"I know what happened," said the commander's wife. "He did exactly what he said he was going to do." I knew at that moment that my plan was a success. "He stole your heart," she continued. "He stole me. I can't believe this. How easily we both fell for his trap. And I think this is yours," she said while throwing a black object with a note attached to it. "Honey, you're getting exactly what you wanted. I'm leaving, both your office and you. And I must inform you before I leave, that Phantom Keys guy surely does know how to kiss." And with that, she took her leave.

"What is this," asked the chief, trying to hold back his sorrow.

"It looks like a piano key," I responded. "I think it's one; a black piano key. Do you want me to read the note for you, sir?"

The commander sat down and waved for me to read the letter,

"Dear Commander, I must inform you that you fell directly into my trap. I thought you were going to ask your wife to appear to save yourself from harm but you didn't. But that was my only miscalculation. I expected your wife to show up and I was still going to commence with my plan. Luckily you told her not to show up, but I must say that you were too arrogant to hear her out that you continuously made her seem insignificant, which made it so much easier for me to win her over. I must honestly say that you were a fool for not listening to her. I hope you enjoyed my first little game because there are many more to come. Yours truly, Phantom Keys."

"Burn the damned thing," he yelled, "I never want to see that damned note again!" I did exactly what he had asked and burned the paper. What a waste of a clean sheet of paper.

### Chapter 17

### Let the Battle Begin

I'd just arrived home from a battle in Ayeguam. Somehow a tiger from the zoo accidentally enter the realm through a portal. I find it amusing how a small life form, such as a rat from this world, can change into a giant, ferocious monster. It's kind of sad to have to vanquish a peaceful creature just because it accidently fell into Ayeguam and transformed.

I turned on the television to see a live news broadcast. There was a lady on there talking about how much she adored some character that goes by 'Phantom Keys'. The name sounds familiar but it wasn't all that important. The lady went on for about ten minutes talking about how cunning and swift he is.

After getting tired of the broad cast, I turned the television off. What was the point of that foolishness? Phantom Keys this and Phantom Keys that. It was all pointless to me.

I woke up the next morning, some time near nine o'clock. Marcus was calling to give me a wake up call. "Wake up sleepy head," he said with his warm masculine voice.

"Morning," I said. "How did your case go, the other day?"

"It was tragic," he replied. "My client was murdered. He asked me to assist in the finding of his nephew, but the kidnapping was staged by the nephew. The nephew killed his own uncle on false pretense."

"Oh my goodness," I responded. "That is very tragic indeed."

"I'm just happy that I was able to put yet another murderer behind bars. And I'm lucky to have a woman like you." He always had a way to squeeze in how much he loved me. And I loved him for that. "I'm about to go down to the office, talk to you later," we said our goodbyes and I got out of bed and prepared for a long day's work.

I was at work when I was getting a call from Ayeguam informing me that there was danger. My store was full with people. I rushed to the door and turned the sign to inform people that I was closing. I couldn't waste any more time since time in Ayeguam was much faster than time on Earth.

I called for my intern and asked her to close down the shop for me because I had to do something important. She was acting stubborn at first so I bribed her. I couldn't take the splitting headache anymore so I told her if she closed today I'll pay her five hundred dollars.

When she left the room I instantly transported myself to Ayeguam. From the call that I was receiving, I could tell that the monster was humongous and was affecting the harmony of the realm tremendously. Within moments I was able to spot the creature. It had tentacles for feet, long vibrant bird like claws for fingers, torn wings, and it had one eye that covered most of its head. I knew at that second that I was going to have one hell of a fight on my hands.

### Chapter 18

### The Jade Monkey Heist

The museum opened a new exhibit today featuring many jade artifacts. The one that caught my eye was the "Jade Monkey". It was a priceless ring that was said to belong to the Greek god Hermes, the god of light, thieves, mischief, commerce, and travelers, but most commonly known as the messenger for the gods.

The ring was said to have been made for Aphrodite, but the night Hermes was suppose to give it to her, it fell to earth. It is said that the wielder of the ring would have the greatest luck throughout his or her life.

I wrote a letter to the commander and the news broadcaster again informing them of the heist. To keep up with my disguise, I created myself a doppelganger to go to work for me. The commander was shocked to see another letter from the phantom. He almost ran through a wall to inform every person in the precinct what he had planned to do.

He made a diverse strategy; I was to stand guard outside of the room. There were to be two men at every corner that lead to the room where the ring was to be held. And outside of the museum, there was to be fifteen officers patrolling the perimeter, plus the news crews.

I had gotten word from my doppelganger that everything was set and ready to go. I was quietly waiting outside in a big tree. I had two more minutes to spare and then I got an annoying ring in my ear. Gwen was in trouble in Ayeguam and she needed my help. Remembering my promise, I transported myself to assist her in the battle.

### Chapter 19

### Unlocking my Potential

I've been fighting this creature for such a long time. It is stronger than any creature that I've ever fought before. Many other monsters joined in the battle and helped out the huge one. But instead of taking the help the monster either killed them or absorbed them into its body.

So far my mother and Mrs. Chambers have come to help me out. Mrs. Chambers told me that she'd made an all call and asked for assistants from others. Apparently there are many people like us around the world that even my mother had no clue existed. Mrs. Chambers said they are about seventy-five more and they were all her children. It made a lot of sense to me because she has been on planet Earth for almost fifty-thousand years.

The battle was getting fiercer by the second. Giovanni had finally arrived. We came up with the plan to defeat the excess monsters that was surrounding the big one.

I decided to sit back and relax for a while to regain my strength. All I could think about was if I would survive this battle and would I see Marcus again.

I heard a large crash come from behind me. It was another small monster. It had the appearance of a bear and a lion. It charged for me so I dodged it. With no haste, it turned around and charged for me again. Without knowing, I found myself placed back against a wall. The beast continued to charge for me. I ran out of options to escape and there was no way for me to jump over it, I decided to do something that I'd never tried before, I infused my being with the hard rock behind me.

The beast rammed into the wall repeatedly as if it would affect me. I manipulated the rocks that surrounded me and forced them to rise. I kept them rising until they'd reached the height of about one-thousand feet. I made a volcano. The lava began to quickly flow towards the ground.

Many of the creatures that we were battling began to disintegrate from the heat of the lava. To my dismay, the humongous monster stood tall. It seemed as if the lava had no effect on it at all.

Seeing that most of the ground forces were taken care of, I began helping Gigi with the bird-like creatures.

"Gigi," I yelled, "look out for the one behind you!" He quickly turned around but wasn't fast enough to attack it. The creature's talons scratched through Giovanni's wardrobe and cut through some of his flesh. Giovanni started to heal but not quickly enough.

I threw flames at the creature to keep it at bay. It had then charged towards me. I began thinking of a possible solution to the problem at hand. The bird, with its beak wide open, was inches away and then by instinct, I turned into dust.

### Chapter 20

### Let's End This Now

How could this be, I asked myself, my sister eaten by a bird. At that moment I saw crystals burst out of the bird-creature. It was Gwen. She survived somehow.

"Gigi," she called out to me, "whatever you do, do not get eaten by these things. What I just saw in there would change a person's life forever." That was just like her, to make a fully traumatic moment seem like a game.

"That's great to know," I replied with a grin. "How did you do that?"

"Just trust in your own abilities. It'll come to you."

I did as she said. I trusted my abilities and my body became more lucid and free. I looked down at my hands and couldn't find them. I had truly become the wind. I was now able to see air currents. I manipulated each current and created my very own bombs. I began killing off each flying creature I could see.

"Gwen," I yelled, "I think we should really get rid of the big one, it seems as if everyone else can handle these little guys."

She nodded her head in agreement. Instead of falling towards the ground as I did, Gwen chose to remain mid-air. I met up with my mother and we charged towards the monster. She began to rise on a fast growing tree. It seemed as if my mother had power over plants. She forged vines to hold the creature in place.

With all the strength I could muster, I began to change the atmosphere around us. Clouds began to roar loader than ever. It was a cataclysmic weather overload. I made it rain, snow, and hail. I began throwing thunderbolts to defeat the beast. I increased the speed of the wind and made miniature hurricanes, cyclones, and tornadoes. They had little effect.

I looked towards the sky and saw what Gwendolyn had concocted. Massive meteors came falling towards the monster. Each meteor had a direct hit. The monster continued to fight back. I decided to make four sacrificial doppelgangers. Each one with its own powerful force behind it, for each doppelganger was in the form of one of the elements I controlled.

Each doppelganger went forward and attacked the monster simultaneously. The monster began to get weaker and weaker. Gwen continued to flail her meteors at the creature. And then it came, Gwen's secret weapon. I stared at her because I knew that the power to control such a weapon must be taking its toil on her body. Gwen had conjured a gigantic meteor that was the size of three mountains. It crashed into the creature and caused a huge explosion that knocked everyone away from the monster.

Surprisingly the monster was still standing. It tried to move forward but it had lost all of its strength from Gwen's last attack.

Gwen began to fall out of the sky. I flew as quickly as I could to come to her rescue. She was pale in the face. I could tell that she was spent from her hard work.

"Gigi," she called out, her voice weak. "Take me to the monster...I. want to see what was it that caused so much strife."

I arrived to where the monster had fallen. It seemed to have been disintegrating. I lowered to the ground and saw that the beast was in fact human.

"Mrs. Chambers," I called out, "you might want to see this."

She ran as fast as she could and examined the body. At that moment Gwen looked over and had a psychotic overload. "Marcus," she screamed. "Marcus! How did he get her," she asked looking towards Mrs. Chambers. "Why...why must things end like this." Gwen began crying. With each fallen tear, she began to rise higher and higher into the sky. And then there was a flash of light that illuminated the sky. "Gwen," I shouted from the top of my longs. At that moment I saw Gwen's semi-lifeless body fall from the sky.

"Take her home," said mother, "Meredith and I will heal him. He'll be okay; he's just going to be in a long coma."

With that, I left them there and took Gwen home to rest. I pray that she's alright and that she was able to hear mother's words before she blacked out. I had then looked at a clock and saw that I had one more minute left to perform my heist, so I made yet another doppelganger, and left it to care for Gwen.

...

I made it back to the tree that I was waiting in before I left for Ayeguam. The town's bell began to ring so I began my heist.

I jumped onto the top of the museum to let the press know that I had arrived. I entered the museum and avoided every guard that came my way. When I made it to the room where the Jade Monkey was located, I found my doppelganger unconscious already. I enter the room toward the glass case that held the ring. When I got to the glass the only thing I found was a note and a white flower.

"Dear, Phantom Keys, I find that this ring suits me more than it suits you. It's quite amusing what you can do when you actually attempt something new. I found it easy to steal such a precious artifact. I hope you're able to escape in time because I kind of made a pathway that leads to you. You might want to leave in a hurry. Love always. The White Rose. Kisses."
