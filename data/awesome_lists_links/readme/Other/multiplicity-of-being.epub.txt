# Foreword

Is this a postscript story to "Dragon Love"? Not an epilogue? Not an ending but an opening into another song?

A song that will sing out, but sing out what?

How all are saved?

Who survived?

How the slave to number came to find love? Do you remember him? Maybe not. Does that matter? No, as all will be revealed.

This volume tells how he found someone to love, a dancer on a world accessed through the portal opened by Love's number.

Such is the multiplicity of being that all things must be so, somewhere, somewhen.

But let's not forget that upon a slowly fading world, a world devastated by fire, there lies a still burning carcass of what looks like a dragon, dwindling even as you watch.

To the side is a ruin that may have been a tall tower. It too will soon pass away as it has no place in the multiplicity of being as the great mother unpicks the flaw that has appeared where once only perfection lived.

She can repair this patch so as you would never know it existed but she will not forget. She will keep watch and, with her darning needles ready threaded for all eventualities. No fault will ever endure for long, not as she experiences it.

But go back. A dragon you say. How can it be?

What do we know about a dragon? What is it that we think we know?

The hate, the spite, the vengeful souls birthed in a star and immortal yet can die?

Some things must be true but all this must burn away to leave one final truth:

not hate,

not spite,

not birth,

not death,

not immortality?

Not even love?

Not . . . but wait.

Maybe love after all that has gone before.

Yes, love.

Do you ask yourself how can such things as dragons persist in the cauldron of a star?

Do you still not see?

Dragons are eternal.

Watch, listen and learn.

A star somewhere, somewhen, maybe in some other story, throws out a flare that could turn a world to ash. But no, instead a dragon is born, is reborn, back to take its place in time, back into the songbook of all things.

Again no. Not one, not two but three.

Three new dragons?

No, not new.

Where once was one now there are three.

Yet there must always have been three.

Dragons are eternal.

Time and space may churn and spin, universes try to tear themselves apart.

A ripple spreads out, colliding with nows and thens, setting off more and more ripples. Ripples of light and fire, noise and destruction spread out throughout space and time, changing or is it unchanging everything, making things as they should have been.

So what is new? Was this not always so?

Things adjust, settle down, things become another same thing as long as dragons are eternal

even if all else changes.

Such is the paradox of dragons.

A dragon dreams another story

What does a dragon dream of?

Is it gold?

Is it treasure?

Is it war?

Is it vengeance?

Is it fire and destruction?

What does this dragon dream of after ten thousand dreams upon this world of a single day

relived again and again, in that prison that defied time, defied science and lore in impunity?

What does this dragon dream of now? A high plateau and a lake, a doting and dozing parent

watching over a girl and a boy as they splash about in the shallows, catching small fish in their hands, laughing and singing, playing.

Do you see their reflections in the water?

Now human, now dragon kind.

What is this joke?

What is this dream but an affront to all that live.

Look again and reconsider.

Where there is love there must be compassion and understanding.

Compassion? Forgiveness? What is there to forgive?

Do you think you understand?

I think not, but you should if you are to survive the coming fire.

This dragon dreams such things?

How did they get there?

The dragon parent turns over in his doze and unfurls his wings a moment, then they settle back.

Ah, we see. Two creatures asleep, the dragon girl and the dragon boy have left the pool side and clambered close to the furnace within, tucked up cosy in the hollow of its belly.

But a parent you say?

Aye and what a parent he is. But in another story, another dream from what is to come.

## Part One: Two Orphans

Same Difference

Why this war of differences?

What is it that makes enemies of us all?

What is it that turns this world to war,

turns country against country?

Town against town?

Street against street?

Neighbour against neighbour?

Friend against friend?

Brother against brother?

Sister against sister?

Husband against wife?

Father against son?

Mother against child?

Some say it is a curse.

Some say it is a plague.

Some say it is them,

some say it is us.

Some say it is the differences.

Some say it is the same old things,

the same differences.

What differences?

We know we are all the same,

all brothers and sisters,

all friends and lovers.

Is this what they hate?

What we hate?

And some say, in whispers,

it is the same old lies,

told by those who would hold onto power,

told by those who would have that power.

Told by those who want us to die in their stead.

Those who would enslave us with even more lies.

Those who would find more excuses why we should kill,

why we should be put to death.

Kill for us or you will die, they shout,

and all those you love will die as well.

Die for us or you will die.

Either way you die.

Either way we die.

Die and reap your rewards.

Die instead of us and be a hero.

Kill and die for us?

And what?

Be dead amongst the dead.

Equal at last.

Free from lies but still just dead.

Only dead.

Yes, those are the ones.

They who would rule the world,

even a world devoid of all life

but those in power

before they devour even themselves.

Aye, just the same difference,

the same old nothing, same old lies.

Look, Targets!

The road below is no longer empty.

Who is it dares to move so boldly

without cover under this sun,

dressed in blue and white,

leading the young and the aged  
under a flag of hope.

The snipers raise their heads and scowl

"Hey Leftside, do you see what I see?"

"Rightside, you old goat, while I l have two eyes,

and you still breathe, what say you  
we have some target practice.

Let's shatter their pride."

"Truce then, but be ready  
as I will part your hair  
when I am done below."

Dragon's Blood

1 - Count Down

"Curi, I am scared. They are gone, dead, all of them, every one. Will we be dead soon? Will it hurt and will we still be friends?"

"Iosef, please don't cry. I don't know if we'll die. I will try to stay with you "but you must be quiet.  
Can you count up to a hundred and back down."

"Yes, I can count inside my head all the way to one hundred and beyond and then back again."

"Sit close and I will hold you close, beneath this sackcloth, and you can be my counter."

2 - Fate

"Iosef, look a peacemaker

lying in the shade beneath  
a cloud of flies.

"Shall we help him,  
if he lives, before he is found  
and sent where all the dead go?"

"Quick Curi, before they come.  
I will take his right and you his left.  
He does not look that big.

"I think he must be a teacher  
like your dad and mine.  
We can drag him in if we go now."

**3 - Nothing Out of Place**

Trails in the dust and an angry buzz of flies around a puddle of blood are all that is left.

Soon not even that as the flies, replete, disappear and a small figure, in sackcloth, sweeps at the dust with a palm frond then melts back into the buff shade chameleon like, gone.

4 - **Agreement**

Two boys huddle before an old man, old before his time, made old by pain and by the dark lord who holds his heart in his bony hands and squeezes.

"You work to save me and have risked your lives when it was I who came with so many from my world to help and save you. To share the hope we had with those who still survived upon this war torn rock."

"Please drink this and tell us how to help. We are Mercuri and Iosef, just friends all alone.

"Our families are gone, blown away by noise, burnt or buried beneath the hospital where we hid."

"You have done more than I have right to expect. The water will suffice and some rest before we must go.

"Look inside my pack and pass me the small square box. There are some rations you may share between you.

"I fear we will not see another day if we remain here. Let me sleep to nightfall and then wake me for one last time.

5 - Nightfall

The peacemaker, coughed, and wiped away the blood from his chin. He beckoned the two closer and then spoke, no more than a wheeze:

"Come closer still. There is no more help coming for us and my life is draining, fading even as I speak. I think I must send you to my world away from all this hatred.

"You are orphans and will find no love, only more death in this place. I have no wife and no children, they were taken from me in some hell like this one here.

"I will share one more gift that is within my power. Do you understand? Do you agree?

"I will take you as my sons, though twice orphaned you will be. I give into your hands the keys to open a way out of this cauldron of spite.

"First take these gifts, see here. Hang the ribbons over your heads. Yes that is right, the abacus and slide rule are yours.

"See how they move, how they slide. There is some magic in them still. You can read them this way, turn them to face the lamp light.

"They were my own father's and his father's before him. Now they are yours. keep them safe and they will remain true to you.

"Hold hands and I will hold yours. Listen carefully as I feel my time is passing fast. You are now sons again, though briefly I fear, and brothers for the rest of what lives you have.

"Now I let your hands go, and you yours. Sit ever so close together, yes like that, so you are touching, and pay attention to my final words.

"Curi, lean close and I will whisper in your ear. Did you hear the numbers? Yes? Good. These are the numbers that you must bring together using the circular slide to unlock the door out.

"See how it spins and turns, first one then the other. Nod if you can read them. Good, It is ready. Poised to go.

"Iosef, there is a number you must count down from. Let me whisper it to you. See the counting beads slide to mirror its value. It will match you as you count backwards.

"Use the tools you now hold and ask them in your hearts to perform the tasks you have been set.

When I raise my hand you both must speak the numbers only you know, the numbers speaking in your heads.

"Do not be scared and do not cry out. Be strong and, in time, forget all the pain. Live good lives and speak only truth. Remember me and make me proud."

The ground shakes

The bombs are falling again

Now, the father says

Now, the boys say in their hearts.

Numbers build and numbers decay.

Surely it will be too late.

Far away, screaming rings out,

screaming from all about.

The father starts to shake

and tears escape from beneath

his eye lids, fast shut from pain.

He gasps and raises his hand

Three numbers are whispered

and the father smiles

as the ground seems to fall away

and the boys scream as they drop.

Down the Rabbit Hole

Are they falling and where to?  
For how long?

For eternity or for an instance?  
They clutch each other close as they tumble

for a blink of an eye,

but such an eye,

an eye that belongs to something

that knows a blessing when it hears it.

Music and singing crash about them.

They have arrived. Are they dead?

They are more scared than they have ever been.

But not of bomb or bullet.  
No. Fear of something unknown.

A Dragon Mage

"He is dead, the mage,

who brought you here

is dead. His body was cold

when we found him.

"Do you know why

he brought you here?

He was a great man,

a mover for peace."

Two confused boys turn  
and look from one to another.

"A mage, like a wizard?

The man we helped?"

"He said he would be our father

and he would save us from harm.

He gave us these,

a slide rule and an abacus."

"He hung them around our necks

and said they were ours.

He said they had magic in them

and showed how they worked."

"Let me see

Yes, see here,

this symbol of a dragon

that was his sign.

"Gullást, the golden dragon,

was his guide and guardian

until he forsook our world.

We never thought to see him again.

"Now we have you two  
to take his place.

Welcome dragon sons

to the University of the Phoenix."

Phoenix

This place has been reborn so many times. It cannot be wiped off the slate for long. It is championed by all who wish to learn. It is the home of wisdom and magic. It is watched over by the spirits of dragon and phoenix.

This Phoenix is a world, an island, a mountain, a university, a way of life, a life force, and it is here that two war orphans fell to earth. The phoenix and the dragon watch their every step,  
they guide their growth and their learning with such a gentle touch and by unspoken direction.

Will these two bring hope and change to all who pass through these doors or do they bring something other?

Could it be for their own salvation that their journey starts here?

Will it be a journey to throw off such sorrows and, at journey's end, for both to rise Phoenix-like into the sky, a brand new sun and a brand new moon to light the way by day and by night?

Dragontouched

1 - Knowledge

Should we know?  
Does it matter?  
They are so young  
it may be too soon.  
Or too late. No not that!

Just a few strands of hair  
for the teller to read.  
What harm would it be?  
Take them while they sleep,  
they do not need to know.

**2 - Telling**

There are two to read  
and one dragon to find?  
How can that be?  
No matter, tell me no more.

This lock like red gold,  
I shall start with this.  
Quiet now, and clear your thoughts,  
hide your worries and concerns.

Are yes, I see it clear.  
There is signature left for me to see.  
A dragon has been here,  
one of gold and knowledge.

I see a search for answers  
and I see many trials.  
The way ahead twists and turns  
but ahead I see a golden glow.

Now for the next, so dark  
it seems to bleed night  
into the light that falls  
upon my palm.

This is strange, beyond belief.  
I not seen such a thing as this.  
I cannot tell for sure  
but what I feel cannot be.

Dare I say what I see.  
I dare as I must share.  
I would say that two dragons  
have left their signatures

upon this small child.  
But, no, maybe not two.  
I cannot be sure.  
Would a dragon pause twice?

What can I tell?  
I see a forked path,  
all shadow shot through  
with silver and gold.

It is as if pain and passion  
battle for this soul,  
but which will win  
I would not dare to guess.

Healing

Flashes and crashes split the night  
into shards like falling ceilings.  
Flaming people scream and melt  
buildings burn and fly apart.

A soft hand wipes a brow  
and soft words calm the fear  
as sleep returns and dreams  
walk down a gentler path.

Days come and days go,  
wounds heal as memories  
are reworked and are filed away.  
Two brothers grow and mend.

Two sons of a dragon mage  
eat and play and learn to put aside darkness.  
Two dragon sons, so full of promise  
as would make a father proud.

Two brothers grow strong  
beneath the gaze of magic benign,  
beneath the gaze of ancient beings  
who see a future shaded with dark and light.

A Game of Numbers

See these cards?

Turn them over and tell me

what it is you see.

First you, Mercuri.

"I see many different numbers

like combinations to locks,

so many ways to open so many doors.

Doors to so many different rooms.

"I see so many possible combinations.

but here, if I move this one here

and that one there, look!

See how it wants to move on its own.

"As if it knows the door is meant for.

Can you tell me where it is,

the door it wants to open

and where it leads?"

It is a door to your father's library.

One day you shall go there

but not yet as you have much to learn.

Now you Iosef.

"I see a great animal described.

See how the cards fall

if I pick them up and drop them.

Here is its number.

"And look, if I turn the table round,

the number revealed is for another.

It reads like a bird of fire

all changing yet the same.

"Two creatures linked by fire.

These cards number gold

and these here, silver,

like two hands clasped together."

Your father chose very well.

You three were thrown together

by what you both have seen

here in these numbered cards.

The Dragon brought you here

and placed you in the Phoenix's care

for some great scheme

that remains hidden for now.

We must trust in them

and let you follow their lead.

Whether the way is dark

or light we shall wait to see.

Many years pass. The two boys grow into young men and into their inheritance of fire. Dragon fire that dances to the magic of numbers.

Running, Climbing, Counting

I run and run

to lose myself

but I count as I go.

I climb and climb

to find out where I am,

and I measure as I go.

I have circled this island

seven hundred times.

I have counted every lap.

I have climbed this mountain

a dozen times and no more.  
I know its measure now for sure.

What is it I look for?

That I will not know until I see it,

but I measure as I go.

What is it I run from?  
That I do know and I wrap it  
deeper with every lap.

Numbersmith

1 - Our Lives

Numbers are my life  
they are the bond between

what was and what now is.

Numbers were our shared father's life,

the one thing we know about him,

the one thing we share with him.

Numbers are my brother's life,

he is on a journey to uncover

the numbers of the all things.

2 - Our Work

Numbers are my life

they are like magic,

the way they flow and swirl

through the machines

I construct out of no more  
than air and dreams.

Numbers are my brother's life,

they are like whispered prayers,

the way they open up like flowers,

when he counts his way

from their obscurest of origins

to their brightest of conclusions.

3 - My Fear

Why does he run from me?

Does he not know I love him,

my brother and always so

Why do I fear that, one day,

he will be lost. I will be to blame,

and I will be left here alone?

Why does he not confide

what it is that drives him so far

from all he has known?

Why do I fear it is some  
inconsequential thing I did,

but what it is I do not know?

Why is it so?

Who can tell me

why I feel like this?

A Mountain Climb

A sudden storm halts a runner, a climber,

driving him to look for cover

He stumbles and sees a gap

a crack in the rock face.

One he never saw before.

He slides beneath the stone

and climbs upon a boulder.

Where is this place?

He can feel a breeze

and smell, carried on it, something sweet,

cloying and memory tugging.

Incense it is, but how?

As his eyes adjust

he sees the glow of a flickering light.  
He searches for its source,

straining to see into the gloom.

There, further back,

deeper into the mountain.

He feels his way with care

far into the mountain's heart.

Already wet and now cold,

he must find it or maybe perish.

Deeper and deeper he slides,

the flickering light is always just out of sight.

The sweet incense grows stronger,

he feels as if he floats in a drunken dream.

He squeezes past one last rock

and a blast of heat hits him.

There before him is a cavern,

full of dancing shadows,

and at its centre a fire dancing

silver and gold flames entwined.

He hears the murmuring of a song

as if it is sung by singers so far away.

It must be the wind or the grind of mountain

battling with the storm above.

He is too tired and cold to care.

As there is no one here to ask permission

he throws off his clothes, spreads them

on the rocks around the fire.

He kneels before the fire with a sigh

his arms spread out to soak in the warmth.

When the shivering stops

he slumps in a heap and sleeps.

While he sleeps he dreams

he is in a cavern by a fire

sheltering from a storm.  
In the flames he sees two spirits,

a dragon and a phoenix

entwined in an embrace.

As one, they turn to him and speak

about all that troubles him.

What they tell him will be with him  
for all the trials that life drops

onto the path he walks

as he returns home and goes beyond.

Words Spoken in the Smoke

Listen, child of fire,  
you remember things we know  
can no longer be.

Here let us take them  
away as they are stories  
from another tale.

When this smoke clears  
they will be gone and their tears  
will no longer be yours.

Your other concerns

are like this smoke you see,

they will fade away.

Face them all bravely

and you will see it is true,

you will master all.

We will be, for you,  
what your parents, taken twice,

would have been to you.

You will find us here,

in the space behind your heart,

when you have the need.

But remember this:

follow your muse in all things.

Let not fear guide you.

The Method of Loci

1 - Mercuri

Today Iosef and I will set about  
a wonderful project.  
We must spend time together,  
if it is to work as I wish,

like we used to do.

He was so reluctant at first.

"Brother," I said, "just listen.

I need you for this to work.  
You were always my counter  
and now I need you more than ever."

"This memory palace we create  
will enable my work to progress,  
to succeed. We can start small  
with just one room, this one will do.  
This one we used to share."

"In this palace we shall construct

and house my great machine.

Fueled with the numbers you have uncovered,

I will plot the turning of the wheels of existence

and open the doors to other realities."

"It will continue our father's work,

like when he brought us here.

Think of the wonders we will find.  
Think of the knowledge we will share

with all the peoples of all the worlds."

2 - Iosef

Today I must spend with my brother,  
my war brother, my dragon brother.  
He does not know how I feel,  
how my head feels like it will fracture.

Why can I see so many paths,  
so many different futures,

but not one where he loves me  
in the way my being craves.

Why does he not see my hands shake  
when he is close and or how my counting falters.  
I cannot do without my numbers  
for without them I am nothing.

Does he wonder why I run so far from here?

Does he ask why I climb so high above here?

Does he not know the secret I keep?  
How I must be far from him so I can think about him.

Now I must help him build a memory palace  
where we can be together, our minds naked  
and all secrets held there for each to see.  
If it must be so then I must own up that truth first.

Mercuri

1

Mercuri, should I tell you I love you?

When I almost know you know?

When I know you know I know?

What is so wrong with love?

It really screws us around.

Tonight! I will tell him tonight.

What do I think he will say?

I know he will not be angry,

I know he will hear me out.

I know he will tell me no.

Ah, love, you bring me down so.

2

We have finished work.

It must be tonight or never

"Come back to my room," he says,

"I will cook you a meal

while you build a fire.

"We can talk and eat and relax

and you can tell me

what is on your mind,

what it is that makes you

oh so dull and clumsy."

Ah, love, what have you planned for me?

3

We are sprawled out by the fire,

we have eaten till we're full and drunk some wine.

Now, it must be now,

my heart beats so fast.

I cannot breathe and the room spins.

Calm down, I must relax, catch my breath.

What is the worst that can happen?

He can say no, not ever, no!

I hear it, I see his regret,

I've seen it played out so many times in my mind.

Ah, love, I cannot do this no matter what you say.

4

He lays back on my lap and shuts his eyes.

Oh no, not now I've made up my mind

to hide my feelings and move on.

I try to think of something to say

but he turns over on to his side.

He is now resting on my crutch and cannot help but know it.

He looks up at me and raises his eyebrows.

"I did not know you cared for me that much," says he, sitting up,

"come get it out, let's measure it,

after all you are the Counter and this can be your rule."

Ah, love you are so cruel.

5

"I want you to make it a project," he laughs,

"check out all our colleagues.

See if they meet our new gold standard.

Come let me see it, my friend."

But I must shut my eyes, hide my head and weep

He relents and gently pulls my hands

from my face and tips my chin up.

I feel a kiss upon my brow so gentle I cannot be sure

but then upon my eyes, the tip of my nose,

my chin and the briefest caress upon my lips.

Ah, love, what do you do to me?

6

"Iosef," he says, "I am so sorry.

come my friend, my love,

my almost brother, do not be sad.

I am so unkind when I mean just to play.

Listen to what I have to say.

"You are my Counter and I love you,

but not that way, not now, not ever.

Still love it is, as much as I can love.

Forgive what I said and blame the wine,

the moment, but not the love I do feel."

Ah, love, so this is what you planned.

7

So Curi, you do love me and I take that with me

as I return to my room on my own.

He knows that I love him

and he knows the many ways that I do,

but I shall match his kind love

with a love so pure and honest.

I will love him just as my brother.

He is and will be my only family,

and I his where none others remain.

I will stay true and search for a love just for him.

Ah, love, you are cruel and kind by turn.

Room by Room

Where to start on this memory palace?

Why not start with this room?

It is a place we know well.

It is the room where we spoke of family and of love,

where wounds were healed,

where we became whole again.

We should build the walls just so.

The floor and the ceiling of like ancient flags,

the fireplace as the one we warmed

ourselves before and drank wine.

Chairs and table to work from

and then we need to stop and think.

There are tools we will need,

there are memories to reconstruct,

histories to dissect and hang upon the walls,

artefacts to index knowledge to,

cupboards full of shelves and boxes to fill.

But enough for now.

Now we must raise the structure

and enter by the oaken door.

So close our eyes and let the palace be born.

Can you see it? Here is the door,

turn the handle and push it open.

We are in but what is that there!

Another door. Did you think of that?

No. Nor I. But how? Where does it lead?

Is it locked? Is there a key?

Mercuri, what is it troubling you?

A memory of a door and another key.

Can it be true our father's library lies beyond?

A mystery to solve and our first task.

To place the memories and replay that day,

rediscover the combination of levers

and open that door to another age.

What will we find? Did our father know

this day would come and what did he prepare?

The Library

A room lit by candles that have been burning for decades or more

A cosy fire glowing and a comfortable chair near by

A pile of books at its side and on an arm

A letter addressed to us both

A mystery to reveal

A message

A sign

?

A Letter To My Sons

My sons, these are my last gifts to you both.

My library, use it well and know that it will repay your care.

My love; know that my master,

the Dragon, watches over you in my place.

He sent me your way full knowing what my fate would be,

but, put that aside, for now you are safe.

You can carry on and, maybe, complete our work.

It is for you to uncover what that may be.

You are free spirits and the dragon's guidance

will point you along the path best suited

to allow you to pursue your interests and desires.

He has his own agenda and it is tied up in yours.

Someday you will make the connections

and then all our dreams will become as one.

The path will grow dark and your determination may pall

but do not doubt the rewards of all your trials.

Be true to each other and do not turn aside

when the way forward seems blocked and dangerous.

The dragon has need of your strengths,

your talents and your passion for truth and knowledge.

Farewell my boys. We trust you will do your best.

## Part Two: Another Child

Another School, Another World, Another Existence

The Rules of Time Dancing

1 - Dancing

You must lead the dance

Use your essence alone to guide

the days around the dance floor.

Never step out on the floor as yourself,

you must leave your body behind

as the goddess will try to steal you away.

She will tell you she needs you,

she will tell you she loves you.

But that is what she want from you.

You would burn brightly but for a moment,

as a mayfly on its maiden mating dance

before you were swallowed whole by Time.

2 - Dancing Backwards

The dance of past days is the simplest of all.

There are no new steps to learn,

the dance has been danced before

and can be danced again.

Beware of those who tell you otherwise

as they surely want to trick you

and take you somewhere other.

There to trap you and enslave your talents.

3 - Dancing Forwards

To dance forwards is to dance into the unknown,

into the unformed and the undecided.

There will be dances you have not dreamed of

using steps that defy description.

It is a dangerous dance to take as it changes

with every breath, with every thought and at every whim.

You must dance apart waiting, looking for a bright  
shaft of light, a spotlight to follow then follow it while it lasts.

Learning the Steps

Now

listen close,

this you must not do.

Never forget where you begin

in time and where you journey ends;

the steps taken are your own

but your home star

will guide you

back

So

ensure

that you know

the shades of your today

before you look to your yesterday.

They are your anchor and your safe harbour.

Otherwise you may never return

and you will be very lost.

I cannot help you

once you're

there.

You

must free

your mind alone

and let it dance

with the goddess of Time.

Do not speak, not to her as she

will use her wiles to tempt

your essence to join

her in her dance,

and never to

let you

go.

In Dreams

In my dreams I dance alone

across the time's sprung boards

sometimes forwards and sometimes back

In my dreams I dance free

across the dance floor of everywhen

and beyond anywhen to the realms of neverwhen

In my dreams I dance for joy  
and when I wake I look with dismay

upon the trophies I find I have strewn around my bed

In my dreams I dance unfettered

I fear one morning my bed will be found empty,

and I will be lost, forever in the thrall of the goddess of time

House Mother

The Mother:

Come sit, child, with me

Let me comb your golden hair.

Tell me where you go

When the sun has set

And the moon still has to rise?

When you bed is empty?

Tell me, is it love

that takes you far from our care,

some boy from the village?

I am not angry,

not even a little bit

but it must now stop.

Kindra:

Oh, house mother, no

it is not that, not a boy.

It is something more.

In my sleep my mind

goes so far away from here

my body must follow.

I dance through the night

lost in the vortex of time

until the sun calls.

The Mother:

Kindra, golden child,

such dances are beyond

my will and power.

I fear for you now

and must find a way to help

you master this thing.

Do not worry my love

we will solve this real peril

and keep you safe here.

A Meeting of the House Mothers of the School for Dancers

What do we do, she is clearly unlike any dancer

we have had to deal with in the past,

so powerful and so free willed?

Can we really allow her

to continue as

she is?

Answers

are what we need

now. I say we take her ability

to dance away, remove the danger posed

while we still can act, while time still exists for all here.

No, not yet, not while there is still time for her.

We can watch her and teach her

all that we know, help

her to find a way.

Give her

the

time she

needs to learn

how to control her dance

while she dreams in her sleep as

in her waking moments. Please heed my plea.

I say we cripple her while we have a school left.

Who knows the limits of her power,

who here can say where

her time dance

will take

us.

Not I.

Where will

it end and not just

for all us here but for of all life,

through all time, on every world and beyond.

Choices?

Is this now a prison?

I cannot go here or there alone.

I cannot dance again in my dreams.

It is not as if I had had a choice.

It is not as if I knew that was what I did,

well not in the beginning and then not 'til now.

I would run away and find my way home,

if I knew which way to turn.

I would turn back my clock and be home

but that would be so wrong.

I know this in my bones. I cannot do that

to my family, least of all my younger self.

I needs must learn to control this gift,

this dark gift so nearly a curse,

and now a threat to everyone I know,

to everything I love or will love in time,

So I must concur or have no future of my own.

I will be strong, I will be the best, I will live.

Balance

You need balance.

You must hold the flux of time at bay,

find the moment you want

and tease it out.

You need a quiet place,

devoid of all intent, to hide from notice

and then you may watch

the event unfold.

You need judgement

to select the likely path to follow

from all the possible ones

in the torrent of time.

You need strength

to resist the call to follow the performers

in their spinning and their leaps

across the floor of their lives.

Watching Her

1

She is asleep now

and I must keep a close watch

to see the dance start

I must influence

her to teach her to be safe

and how to say no.

The goddess wants her

and that cannot be allowed

as no good will come.

She would tear her life

to shreds and hang them, trophies,

from her sash of blood.

She will not have you,

golden child, while I still breathe

and my old heart beats.

2

I bend over her ear

and whisper "Please do not go."

Does she know it's me?

She smiles, she hears me.

She will not go far tonight

from her bed, just dream.

I will keep her safe

from my sisters' dire threats

to end her dancing.

I will teach her how

to control that wild magic,

her beautiful dance.

Mastery

1

Will I master this dance

or will it master me?

Will I call the steps

or will I dance to Time's call?

2

I did not ask for this thing

but I will not shirk my fate.

I will lead this dance

no matter what the tune.

I shall call the moves

and spin the days.

I am the dancer of time

and I am no one's fool.

3

I have made my vows

and I have pledged my life,

but I have seen what lies ahead

and I shall not be bound.

I know I shall be free of this place

and I shall dance unseen, unchained.

I shall live beneath some other sun

be it in the land of the dead or the living.

I bide my time and mine alone,

not what has been planned by others.

I look to the light and to love

but I do not shirk the dark.

I will know my dance partner (when I see him )

and onto the floor we will whirl.

We will crash out of this place

with a thunder clap and a lift.

Show Me

House Mother:

It is time, show me

that you have control.

Take me with you

on your dance.

Show me the moment

of my own birth

on an island so far

from here and now.

Show me the moment

of my own death.

Where it is is for you

to divine and divulge.

Know this is a test

and that I have seen

these events myself

so many times.

You cannot fool me,

my child, so do not try.

Come, do not be afraid

of what we all must face.

Kindra:

Hold my hand

and follow my lead.

I shall take you

on a dance like none

you have ever felt.

We will we see your birth

and then we will watch

the steps you took,

like a waltz across time

in all its beauty and angst.

We will see the dancers of you

peel off and move away

from the sunlit path you took.

Then we will rejoin it

and follow it to your sleep.

Here, your mother smiles at you,

wrapped in her arms.

Here you take your first step

and here you take your first tumble,

crying your first real tears.

Here you speak your first word;

see your father clap his hands in joy.

Look at your smile, hear your laughter.

Let us spin the days forward to your first kiss.

Oh, you are, both, so beautiful.

Now so sad as you depart.

I see your tears, it is true.

We will step into another dance

and see where that love

may have taken you.

Ah look, it is raining tears!

Let us not follow these steps more.

I am sorry but it may have been so.

Let us return to the true path

and see your first day here.

Look, here you are

taking your first dance class.

You call the steps so clear.

Your charges so attentive,

their dances so true.

One more moment, your last.

So peaceful it is with all your friends

by your side, some sad,

some crying and some resigned.

But where am I?

House Mother:

Yes, my child, all but you.

Where will you be? But hush.  
It is our secret. Promise me

you will say farewell before you go.

Mystery

The Time Dancer has taken up the reigns of her wild horse.

She can bring it to heel, she can make it rear up,

she can make it pirouette and bow and she can let it run free,

dancing its own moves, kicking up sparks and clashes

with every kick of its flashing hooves.

She can ride its back and calm its heart

with a whispered word in its ear.

She can do this without the goddess of time

halting or missing a step as she herself moves

the stuff of being about the dance floor of her realm.

The Time Dancer has set time dancing

and is seeking a path through the dazzling light.

What does she see but a myriad of dances,

all tempting but all leading

to some less than bright star hung sky.

All except one which writhes and splits,

branching all along its journey,

like a living thing, some vine

finding its way past all obstacles

into all possible futures.

Some look dark and some blinding

and some lead to a precipice

and a step into some place beyond reckoning.

Is this what she was warned about

or is it something new, something for her alone?

Home

This is my home.

This where I have lived  
for so many years I can

no longer see my true home,  
except in dreams and when I dance.

Can I really leave it?

Will they let me go

or even let me back?

Why is it a thought

that scares me so?

What is it that will drive me

so far from here?

So far that I cannot follow

it in any dance I can devise.

Is it at some one's behest?

Maybe it is that dancer I see

hidden in the shadows

when I let time show me

the braided paths of my life.

That shadow dancer.

Will he take me in his arms

and lead me far from home?

Who is he and why does the thought

of him make me tremble so?

Is it with love or is it with fear?

There are no answers yet to these questions.

I shall know him from the shape of his dance.

I will have my answers when I step

out onto that dance floor with this stranger

and all other paths are sheared away.

What Lies In Wait

A meeting lies ahead for me

I have seen it some few times.

There is a shadow

thrown by candle light.

I see a strong profile

and broad shoulders.

But that is all I know,

other than it appears

where the threads of my life

cross over and then diverge.

It will be revealed by time

as there is no escaping it.

I will be prepared

and I will call the steps.

## Part Three: A Door Left Ajar

The Palace of Memory

Room upon room radiate out

star-like from the heart rooms,

the nucleus where this all began.

Each room a cog in a machine

wrought from memory and number,

each turning in a plane of its own choosing.

Room upon room churning

the numbers of life into something new

and unseen by any living being until now.

Each room a cabinet of curiosities

numbered and ordered as if

by a magic new and old by turn.

Room upon room expanding outwards

unbound and unlimited by space

or by time, or by spirit or by imagination.

Each room a mystery from one moment

to another to even the builders

but maybe not to some concealed guide.

Mercuri Dreams

I am adrift, suspended,

in a sea without bounds.

Weightless, I can rise and fall,

I can spin and curl.

I feel hands moving

over my skin, testing,

sliding, teasing, moving on.

They lift me and they hold me.

I am dancing, suspended,

in a sea of hands, leading me

through intricate moves

as if I am nothing but a puppet.

I see a creature of light,

I am floating in its glow.

It is dancing, it is singing.

If only I could get closer.

I am mirroring its steps

I am a creature of light

I am singing its song.

Who am I now?

What Is It We Do?

1 - Counter

What is it we do here

in this palace of wonders

we have created out of nothingness,

out of memories and knowledge?

What is it we attempt?

Do you know how to put it

into words, this thing we do?

I follow you whatever,

but what is it we do

while others sleep, make love

and get on with their lives?

I am listening and am ready to comply.

2 - Numbersmith

What is it we do but search

for what is hidden, what is unknown.

We search for other worlds

and for other's looking also for a door

out of their existence.

We look for answers, but more

we search for questions

neither thought nor voiced before.

And we search for who it is

that calls to me in my dreams.

Let me show you. Here in this box,

here is where I keep the memory.

Open it and see it, feel it,

sense the taste of, the scent of it..

This is what is leading me.

I will find this bright creature.

3 - Counter

We will do this thing but remember

my promise made here to you.

I will look for the love you are missing,

be it this bright thing or someone other.

Phoenix Sent: A Meeting in the Park

Iosef

Iosef is sitting in the park

beneath his favourite tree,

idly thinking of nothing much.

His secret is no longer his alone

and a peace now resides in his heart.

All he has to do to find a love

worthy of his brother.

A love who will fill his heart

and bring joy into his life.

It is so warm, he leans back,

he closes his eyes and sleep comes,

followed by a daydream.

The Phoenix is perched high in a tree

and she is looking down at him.

She is speaking to him in an ancient tongue.

What is she saying, what does she want?

She looks away and then nods her head.

She opens her wings and glides away.

He wakes to find a stranger

looking intently at him,

a slight smile upon his face.

Stranger

The stranger sits beside him

and looks out across the park

before he starts to speak:

"I am Angel. My mistress, the Phoenix,

sent me to you in what was a dream.

Since then I cannot forget you.

"And here you are before me.

I do not think I can leave you

unless you send me away.

"I know this may seem mad,  
and I understand if you draw away,

but I think I am meant for you,

"as I feel you are meant for me.

I do not know what else to say,

I have never felt this way before.

"I have said more than enough,

more than I have ever said,

to any man or any woman, or will again.

"Tell me to go and never speak to you again

and I will obey though it will pain me so."

He leans forward as if to get up and go.

Iosef

"No stay and talk with me further.

This is my favourite place in the park.

I have a feeling I will cherish it now more."

Someone For Me

How is this so?

Here am I looking for someone

for my brother to cherish and hold close

when someone, no, not someone,

an angel appears declaring love for me

My own Angel as I am now his.

How is this so?

Love's Number - Part 1

0 - The Number Revealed

Long have I searched for love's number,

a number that would suit my brother's own

and so open the possibility for his joy.

It long eluded me until I woke from a terrifying dream.

A dream like the nightmare that was my entrance

into life and into the truth of what lies ahead of us all.

1 - The Dream

Bombs explode overhead and white fire spits and screams.

All my numbers flash and whirl in front of my eyes

before each one of them resets to zero.

I wake in a panic to find a terrible storm is raging,  
trees moan and the very ground seems to groan.

I stagger from my bed. My head swims.

I check every clock, dial and meter in my room, in dread.

All look back speaking their names and values, all unchanged.

I creep inside the safe of my heart to check my most precious numbers.

Here I keep the numbers of my life's loves.

Here I protect my brother's number

and, here also, the number of my beautiful lover.

What is that I see? Some reflection or refraction?

I cannot be sure, maybe neither. There it is or so I think.

The number I have looked for so long.

I lift it up and hold it up to the light of my imagination.

What colours and what music it makes.

My heart sings along with it, loud and clear.

All this time Love's number has been hiding  
within me and from me until now, when simple fear

unlocks the possibility of great loss.

2 - The Number Shared

I rush to where Curi is working, within the memory room.

I burst in, interrupting what he is doing.

"I have found it," I cry. "Love's number, look here it is."

He looks at me in some disbelief but he takes the number

I bring, scribbled upon a scrap of paper.

A puzzled look crosses his face before he turns to me with a smile.

"I do not know if this is, as you say, love's number

but it looks like the piece that is missing from my puzzle,"

he says, turning it carefully in his hand.

"Here let's try it out, it could just do the trick."

He goes to the newly configured machine,

humming and flashing as it orbits about us.

He recites the number of Love while I stand behind,

resting my chin upon his shoulder

He speaks another word and the great machine starts to purr.

We can feel the doors of the world open

I hear him shout, I hear his joy.

I share his joy, kiss him on his cheek.

He thinks he has found the way

to the bright spirit of Number,

The elemental being of his dreams.

3 - The Open Door

I hear his laughter turn to a gasp of surprise.

My number has not failed us,

a new world crashes into view.

An old dignified woman stands at the portal

beckoning us to cross over with a wave of her hand.

"Please enter our world, oh powerful wizards."

I try to hold him back but go he will and I must follow.

Before I take that step I sweep up the paper scrap

and tuck it in the pocket over my heart.

"Why have you opened a door into our world this morn?" the lady asks.

"We have been searching for the spirit of number," Curi replies,

"to ask it questions about the nature of all things."

"You will find no spirits here at the School

of Celestial and Temporal dance.

But come strangers and join us

"as we break bread this bright day

I am the principal and all here are my charges.

All I know I will share with you."

"Thank you, we accept your kind offer.

Wizards are we not, I am afraid.

My name is Mercuri,

"on my world I am called Numbersmith

and this is my dearest friend and brother, Iosef,

he is my Counter, the finder of the key to here."

4 - Doubt

I follow them towards the refectory,

looking everywhere, memorising every turn,

counting each step we take.

I do not trust this place, I know not why.

Something here chills me to my very bones.

I must be ready to drag him back the way we came

What is it that drew us here?

What is it that revealed Love's number

on this day that started so ill?

5 - Mapping

We pass beneath so many tall arches,

through so many open doorways,

up and down so many steps, all but I would be lost.

In my head I build a map of here,

a model only I can see,

but one as true as this place we walk.

On it I mark a thread of light to reflect our journey,

where're it leads. It will form our escape route

if all becomes dark and with it I will lead us home.

6 - Fate

We stop before a door, all ancient oak and iron.

The principal pauses and holds a finger to her lips

before pushing it open and walking into the brightly lit room.

A room full of the noise of spoons on plates  
and air filled with steam and smells of food.  
Oh how my stomach rumbles in hunger.

We are ushered to a table set aside

from the students of this place.

As we make our way all eyes followed us

except those of a fair maid

who looks down at her plate

until nudged by her neighbour.

She looks up and meets my eyes

before turning to look on Curi.

I see her start and blush,

then look away, hiding her face.

I turn to Curi to speak and see him the same.

Ah Love, what is it you have planned for us this day.

A Door is Left Ajar

(Back on Phoenix)

A pair of coal black eyes peer out

upon a world it does not know.

A blue tongue flicks out to taste the air.

Prey detected; something small, lithe

and scaled, slips from somewhere empty

into somewhere brimming over.

Brimming with life, such tasty life.

Where to start and what to take?  
There, that one, sleeping in the sun.

Smell and taste confirms the choice.

It's male, it's young and it's strong enough.

A push, and a tiny slash, and in through an ear.

Ah, such a brain but only room for one.

Sting the sleeper into a deeper sleep for now.

Drag it from its seat and stuff it in some dark corner,

A dark prison from where it will never find

its way back out should it ever awake.

Now ease into the controls and look for more.

Is It Him? (Time Dancer)

is it him?

could it be him, here

and now, in this joyless place

this dark soul prison, this blight

on my life and heart?

can it be

?

or is it

just another dream?

has he come to take me from

all these rules and restrictions,

from this soul prison

for my dance

?

I will know

the answer to this

question, to this new puzzle.

I will make time, speak to him,

know his intentions,

and his name.

Can It Be? (Numbersmith)

can it be

true that you are here?

in so strange a place as here,

this world far from all I know?

will I know what the

answer is

?

will i know

before i must leave,

before we must return home,

before the door starts to close,

trapping us both here

forever

?

I will know

the answer to this

question, to this new puzzle.

I will find time, speak to her,

know her part in this,

and her name.

I Will Know (Counter)

I will know

what is going on?

what has led us here this day

spinning such a new bright thread

entangling our hopes

in such knots

?

who is this

girl with golden hair,

with eyes of such sparkling blue?

what is her name, her number?*

what does the future

hold for us

?

I will know

the answer to this

question, to this new puzzle.

I will find time, speak to her,

know her heart and his

before long.

Love's Number Part 2

6 - Breakfast

I am hungry and find it difficult to divide

my attention between the conversation,

the girl and the food. Get a grip Counter!

I tell myself as I spy the girl slip

from her seat and leave the room.

Her companions snigger and point.

I will find out who she is

before I leave this place.

Ah, I need some water.

I slip from my seat and approach the table

she deserted and ask for some water.

I pour some from the jug

into the glass left at her setting,

slip a half finished crust

into my pocket unobserved

and return to my brother,

running a finger over the glass.

I take a sip and taste her lips,

I break a crumb from the crust

and I taste her more, her fingers

and her breath, her full lips again.

I will know her and where to find her.

The digits of her number click up slowly

as my subconsciousness reads the signs.

I leave the me inside to do its stuff

and turn back to the others,

still talking intently about number and keys.

What am I getting from this, these words?

Something is not being said.

Something is being held back.

Mecuri is as open a book as always

but this woman, this principal smiles

in darkness. Something is being unsaid,

something is weaving a web,

clouding the air, making my thoughts

stretch and unwind. I call up my numbers,

reinforce them, steel myself

and isolate myself from such effects.

I lean close to Curi and rest my hand

upon his thigh, tap out his number

in a code he understands.

I add a filter he can unfold and use.

The fog retreats and he pats my hand.

"We thank you for your time, the meal,

but I think we must soon return home to our work.

"May we return here and share more knowledge,"

Curi says, pushing his plate away

and slowly standing, followed by myself.

"Surely. But come with me to my office

and I will give you something to take away

with you as a memento of your visit.

"Next time you visit we can put on a show.

The girls here have talents and skills

you cannot dream exist but here they do."

I nod to Curi and he accepts.

We must be careful like never before

but we cannot leave without an answer or two.

7 - A Picosecond of Respite

As we follow the principal,

my map of this place grows apace.

The map revolves and expands

as we climb stairs and burrow

through corridors and pass countless doors.

My golden thread remains true

unrolling and illuminating our steps

and driving shadows from our passage,

leaving our route home starlit.

A sudden glow appears within

the construct of this place;

the girl, I am sure, I have her now.

Ahead of me, Curi stumbles and recovers.

I grasp his arm and look into his eyes.

Time opens like a book for me and for him.

Time is frozen for all around

but we have stepped into another place

inhabiting a space within a blink of an eye.

"Follow me," I say and lead the way

towards the glow I see some few steps

along a branching passageway.

Curi follows close, in silence,

not daring to shatter my absorption.

A question is poised upon his brow.

Soon, my brother, soon we will know

what it is that holds time in balance,

applies the brakes on those grinding cogs.

We pause at a door and I indicate

that he should enter first as I am certain

it is he who is being called.

I am just the engine by which the fates

drive the success or failure of this day.

"Enter Curi, do not hang back."

Mercuri taps politely on the door

before lifting the latch and swinging

it gently inwards on the dragon's will.

8 - A Meeting of Minds

A simple room is revealed,

it is more a cell for some ascetic,

no more than a place for rest and sleep,

But it seems like a jewel box

considering the gem it houses.

A glowing girl, a slender young woman,

who looks intently towards us

and draws us in close.

A timid smile crosses her face.

"How can it be," she says,

"that you can find me

while all others do not see."

"Counter found the way

once I caught the silent call you sent,

so intense, it nearly made me fall."

"You are not safe here," she says,

"I see you know, but not how much.

This place, this school, this citadel

"is but one of confinement for dancers,

dancers such as I who can read

the flow of time and space.

"I feel that you, two, are dancers

of an unknown kind, and are a threat

unless you can be contained

"along with all of us here."

"Come with us," Curi says.

"We can take you to our home."

"Yes, come with us and be free.

I am Counter and this is Mercuri.

We have the key out of this place.

"I think I know you now,

I have divined your number

and I know your name.

"You are Kindra, a dancer in time.

You are holding time at bay

so you can talk to us in secret."

"We are the children of Number,

we are dragon touched and phoenix taught,"

adds Curi. "We are here for you.

"We can take you from this place

if it is your wish and if you trust us.

I know you from my dreams

"and fate has thrown us together this day.

It is as Iosef, my counter, has said.

You are my destiny and I yours."

"I have seen you many times," she says,

"a shadow figure along my timeline,

whether for my good I am unsure."

"Look here, in my hand. This is the key to our world,

let me write it down for you," I say.

"And this is your number as well.

"Do you know how they can be proved?

Do you know someone who can show you?

We must go with the principal before we're missed

"but then we must leave while we still can.

You can watch us and join us

at the doorway to our home."

"I will do this thing, but take care," she replies.

"I shall watch your every step and help you

if I can whether I stay or follow you."

"Now we must return to where she stands,

frozen mid step and unknowing.

We say farewell for but a few minutes."

9 - Back To The Portal

We made our way back to that point

of frozen time and resumed our positions.

Time resumed. "Are you OK," I say.

"Yes, I just tripped," replies Curi.

We continue to follow the principal

and are soon seated by her desk.

"You will return to us, will you not?

We have much to learn from each other.

This is a place of learning and knowledge

"much like the one from which you come,"

she says, as she searches furtively

through a drawer out of our line of sight.

"We would be honoured to do so

but we are here by our own volition.

We must return now before we are missed."

"Ah, here we are, take this with you.

It is a gift, a simple child's toy

that represents a view of this place."

She places on the desk in front of us

a ball of spheres and discs

with a glowing gem at its centre.

"An armilla! But it is beautiful.

We cannot accept this,"

we both say together.

"Then bring it back to us

when you have examined it

and learnt from it what you can."

I remember as if a whisper from my past,

"Do not touch this with your naked hands

as you will be enslaved and never leave."

A memory from where, how can it be?

An implanted memory maybe

but implanted by whom? Dragon or maiden?

I remove a cloth from my pocket,

drop it over the globe and gather it up,

before carefully dropping it in my pocket.

She cannot hide her displeasure

but stands and says, "Until your return."

We leave and make our way hurriedly

back to where the door home should be.

The map I built twists and turns showing

new ways; routes and cuts laid with a silver thread.

Do I trust these routes or do I follow

the golden trail I laid, long though it be.

"Trust the route I show," comes a whisper

we both hear. "Kindra," Curi quietly says.

I nod in agreement. "She will be there!"

I grab Curi's hand and lead the way.

We hear a bell ringing, bouncing peals off the walls

and the sound of running feet.

We hurry on following the silver way.

It climbs and falls and seems to go

where no one else has walked before

through ways ancient and ways not yet built.

We turn a corner and we are there

but a guard stands at the portal

a guard like nothing living, like nothing born.

A creature all arms and spines,

a creature with many eyes

a creature that cannot but see.

The Time Has Come

Kindra:

He has come,

he is here,

but is he one

or is he two?

I stand here holding two numbers;

one the secret way to his home,

the other the concisest of tellings

of me I have ever read.

Two numbers of such power

here together in my hand.

I start my dance

and seek the path

where I know he stands

and, yes, it is him I see,

clearer than before,

but why does he now

throw two shadows?

Are there two of him

or is it the both of them?

Am I to love the one

who moves my heart so

or is it the other, the darker one

who scares me I know not why?

Could it be I must I love both

or can it be I will end up with neither?

All I know is that this

is the only way that leads

to some place more bright

than the dark that lay ahead,

the dark that the dance always led.

Does the dance now show me

another set of truths or lies?

Does this path lead me to some place

darker still without a single star

to pierce the night sky.

I will go with him,

with them both,

and trust that I shall know

which future to choose

when the path divides again.

The Dancer

The dancer is on her own for the briefest of moments.

She must dance like never before,

she must dance for more than just herself,

she must dance to protect, maybe, the love of her life.

She must dance a dance that leaves no trace,

no ripples that can be read by those who can.

The dancer divides the hour into minutes,

the minutes into seconds, the seconds

into parallel strands, all of them possible futures,

and along them she places a multitude of players,

lets them make their moves unfiltered

by the vagaries of temporal matters.

She lets their actions confuse the real players

so they cannot trust their choices.

So they can barely place one foot

in front of another without tumbling

to a ground they cannot even trust

is where it should be any more.

As soon as confusion spreads well beyond her stage,

she makes her way to where her double lover waits,

and with them faces the guard at the portal to away from here.

They will need all their powers and their wiles

to pass this creature unseen and escape.

What steps will she take and will she lead?

Love's Number - Part 3

10 - Escape

We slip into an alcove, somehow unseen.

As we peer from our haven,

we are three, no longer two.

"What is that thing that guards our escape?

Do you know what it is and how to avoid its sight?"

I ask. "Can we defeat this thing and leave?"

"I know not what it is, it is something tortured

by some misuse of the dance, of that I am sure,"

the maiden replies. "Can we work together

"to solve this test and soon at that?"

"Can you use your dance to move

before it arrived, or ahead to when it's gone?"

"Wait," says Curi. "What do we see?

Look and think carefully. It is no simple foe.

No simple ruse will enable us to pass this thing."

The maiden peers and seems to fade from sight

before she turns back to us and smiles

a smile full of dark meanings.

"This is a prisoner in time, compressed

together from no end of versions of itself.

It is as if the past and the future

"are tied by a knotted thread

woven from this one's life.

I shudder at the pain it must feel."

"Can we cut it loose?" I ask. "Take us

on a dance through this knot of time,

and the creature's number I will seek.

"Curi can devise an algorithm

to unpick the twist and turns

that have trapped it here and us with it."

"Yes, if you can, stretch time for us

so each second becomes a minute

and it will be done before we are found."

"Hold on to my sleeves and I will do what I can.

It may see us but it will be in the bubble I create,

I shall endeavour to hide us in the surface

play of light, swirling and spilling about."

The walls around us bow and flow

the light rainbows and even shadows divide

into violet through to red.

I move unseen towards the guard

sliding between the flashes of light and shade.

The creature almost shouts its number

it so wants to be gone from this life,

but our escape is what I desire.

I think I have it. It does not seem right

but I return to where the others float

and whisper the number found.

"What does this number mean?

It has so many digits and so many roots,

so many twists and turns."

"It is all of these things," the maiden says.

"It is all these editions of the creature

trapped in this moment from near and far."

"Feel the solution, Curi," I say.

"There must be one that is for our here.

All the others are from what was

"and from what may never be."

"I will look for what is real for this plane

and isolate it from all the other truths.

"A moment more is all I need."

He closes his eyes and a look

of such concentration spreads

across his face followed by one of calm.

He has crossed into the fortress of number.

"He will back very soon," I say.

"Time means even less where he has gone

and all numbers will dance to his call."

I watch her as she looks upon his face.

Yes, she is the one, I am sure.

She will bring the light back to him,

the light that has faded from all

but the enticements of number.

He will rediscover the joys

of life beyond his research.

Curi's eyes spring open.

"I have it or them, I should say.

Three answers to our problem.

"We must approach him

at the same time and speak

the numbers I have here."

He whispers something to Kindra

and then something different to me.

"We must do this now as the solution

"may not hold true for long

as there is some strong magic in play."

We flow around the bubble of time

and pause, poised above the creature.

Curi silently counts us down

and we say what we have been given.

The creature snarls and rears,

its spines jab out, points like spears,

Its spines slash the air like swords.

The creature shivers and shakes.

It drops its spears and its swords

upon the floor, and starts to split apart.

A myriad of men peel off and fade away

until a single man, sword and spear remain.

He crouches and stares around him.

"Where am I?" he asks. "What demons

bring me here and torment me so?"

Kindra slips into sight and touches his arm.

"You must leave this place now

or you shall be enslaved once more.

I will show you where to go,

"but it must be now or never.

Follow the silver footprints

you see before you and do not stop

"until you reach your home and time."

He looks at us and then turns

and runs, fading from our sight.

"We must be quick, go through the portal

before we are discovered," says Curi.

"Hold my hand and step over with me into our world."

The maiden shyly takes his hand

and we all step into a new beginning,

a new life, a new chapter and a new song.

Leave Taking

Mother, listen, it is now.

I must leave and leave now,

as you knew one day I must.

I have read my futures

and none bring happiness

except for the one

I must now follow.

I cannot tell you where I go

I cannot say I will ever return

but you know this already.

You have loved me and I you,

as house mother and as mother

in place of my own mother long gone,

back at the birth of my dance.

Here my wings are forever clipped,

here I will be as a slave to others' whims.

Out there I can spread them wide,

out there I will be able to dance and fly.

There I can dance the dance I feel,

forwards and backwards

beneath the arches of time.

You know this is true.

You have protected me

and kept my dance alive.

You have taught me well,

held and shaped my hands

and my arms to fix the moves,

but now I must go.

No. I must be truthful to you.

Mother, I am already gone.

This is but a whispered echo,

bouncing from day to day back to you,

no more than a message in a bottle

that has washed up on your shore at last.

Farewell my dance mother.

Arrival

Three figures emerge from a room,

they are smiling, they are happy,

they have managed to get away.

Two old friends and one new one,

one new one with a potential to be more,

to mean more to them both.

"Come with us to the temple of the Phoenix

We will introduce you to the ruling spirit of this place.

We will ask her to take you in and make you at home."

"Will I be welcome?" the maiden asks.

"Will I be able to stay and be with you?"

"Yes, no one who wants to learn is turned away."

"Come, talk to her oracle and see," Curi says.

"We will show you all the sights on the way.

Iosef, you can introduce her to Angel."

"I will, and then we can go and find something to eat.

We can find you somewhere to stay, and then clothes

and everything you will need to be comfortable."

Kindra laughs along with them,

threads her arms through theirs

and runs with them out into the sun.

The Phoenix

The phoenix Tulintu and the dragon Gullást

watch as the young woman approaches the altar.

She is nervous and looks from side to side.

Her companions wait at the entrance.

"Is this the one?" Tulintu asks. "I like the look of her.

She slips through the eddies of the moment with ease,

her steps fall upon a path that will lead her to greatness.

What say you, dragon? Does she suit your need?

"Will she make a suitable mate for your numbersmith?

She cannot have your counter as I have succoured

him for one of my own as you already know."

"She will do if things go the way I've seen," Gullást replies,

"but only time will tell and, as she is a mistress of time,

we will have to wait and see. There is a darkness

yet to dispel and the light she brings may search it out

and allow us to rip it out for the good of all."

"Let us listen to what she has to say.

Let us read her intentions and give our judgement.

The oracle is poised and in tune.

I will speak with this child now."

Kindra and the Oracle

"Phoenix, I come before you

to ask for your help in my studies.

I am a refugee from another world,

I throw myself on your mercy.

I will serve you in any way I can

if I may stay and learn from you.

"I am a time dancer and can read

what may come about and what may not.

I can follow outcomes back to their roots

and I can step out of this moment and walk

with the ghosts of the future and of the past.

I have much to learn and learn I will."

"Child, welcome to my world, my temple

and this great university of the soul.

We see much that is good in you

and much that is in need of support.

Stay with us and we will endeavour

to make the journey one to fulfilment.

"We can see your journey is entwined

with sons of ours and trust your intent

will serve their needs and their desires

and not distract them from their research.

You will find us ready should you seek guidance.

Go, child, and walk free throughout our realm."

Another Dawn

She awakes from a troubling dream.

She rises from her bed and goes to the window

Through which the light of a new day streams.

She stares out into the different dawn and rejoices.

She looks out onto a world of possibilities,

A new world full of music and song.

She sets the dance turning time backwards,

She sets the dance turning time forwards,

And confirms a world where joy has come to live,

But she looks deep, sees something almost expected,

Another shadow casting a stain across her path,

Some other she knows will try to taint her dance and her destiny.

She is strong and will get stronger.

She will be ready for whatever this shade

Has in mind for her and the life she desires.

My Name is Angel

My name is Angel.  
I don't know what has happened,  
why it is so dark,

why it is so quiet,

why I cannot feel anything.

Am I dead?

Am I in a coma?

Have I had a stroke?

Will I ever get out of here?  
Am I going mad?

Tulintu, if I be not dead, take me

from this place and return me

to my life and to Iosef whom I love.

I am your servant

and always will be.

Tulintu, if I be dead, take me

into your heart and let me be

with you until the end of all things,

as they are now. Let me be reborn

from flame to serve you once more.

You Are Lost

You are awake

Against the odds you wake

You are strong but not strong enough

None have ever been nor will be

You are lost

You are nameless

What was yours is now mine

All that you were will become me

I will have it all

When I have total control

You will become nothing but a whisper

You will be less than a ghost

I am you

I am now Angel to this world

I will be Angel to those you love

I will be Angel to those who loved you

I will be a stronger Angel,

a better Angel than you ever could be

And then I will become death

to all you are, to everything you know

There is nothing you can do

But watch and listen and feel and taste it all

As I learn this world that was yours

And feast upon it all in all its guises / wises

Demon

Remember everything:

What I was taught

What I know

What I believe

What I am and who I am

Remember everything:

Who I knew and know

What I loved and love

Who I loved and love

Who loved me and love me still

Remember everything:

Seal it up in a grain of opal

And cast it into the seas of time

Let it wash up on some far shore

Uncharted and unknown

Now unremember everything:

Now wipe it from the slate of what is left of me

Now it cannot be taken from me

Now it cannot be used to torment me

Nor hurt those I loved and love still

I do it now

Let the demon do what it will

Let it tear me to shreds

Let it devour me

Let it erase me from this moment

I am, as it said, nothing

I can no longer be hurt.

I am no longer here

Stronger Than Life

Ah, drat the man

You think you have won

Maybe you have won some small victory

But to what end I ask

As I still rule

You gift me much

This shell, this husk, this life,

This body that moves to my every whim

I will use it for my pleasure

Til it's last gasp

You've hidden all:

Who and what you are

You have hidden the ones you love

The things you love

Yet I will know

I'll find them all

I will make them sigh

I will make them despair as they climax

They will fall before me

As all must do

Watching

Kindra:

These two have torn up the life I had

and for what I must ask myself.

There they sit working intently

on some project yet to find voice

other than in number.

What did I see that made me run

from all that I knew to some promise

of a better life, full of free choices.

What is it I can read in their faces?

I can trace a history of pain

and a passion for knowledge.

I can read a story that includes love

for each other and for those who are true.

Can I be one of those?

What can they be to me?

What is it I want from them?

I want a love without limits,

a love without compromise.

I want a friendship true,

freely given and honest too.

I think I see it there before me

linked to these two, a lover and a friend.

Do I love you?

Curi:

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

is the need I feel

to be with you.

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

is what makes me

run to be with you.

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

makes me dream

of you and you alone.

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

makes me say your name

out loud when I am alone..

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

is what makes my heart beat

so fast when you are near.

Do I love you?

I think I do if love

it is that makes me smile

and act the fool.

Nadir and Zenith

Dragon:

It has arrived as I predicted,

it has found its way into our kingdom.

I knew it would come,

I knew it could not keep away.

Now we must track it down

and send it on its way.

Let it wage its chaos

on some other world.

It cannot die but it can be tempted

far away from our realm.

Phoenix:

I know you dragon,

this has always been your plan.

and this the darkness

of which you lately spoke.

Did you bring it here

so you could manipulate it,

get it to do your dirty work,

and then shove it off some precipice,

into to some chasm where it will fall

for an eon, only to emerge renewed

on some other world full of victims?

Deny all you want but I know you.

Dragon:

It is not all as you think.

I will keep my intentions unspoken.

I trust no one from this moment forward.

You would do well to remember that.

You must do as you feel fit

but know I mean none here harm.

There is something I must do

and you will find the same.

Something close to you needs attending to

but again I cannot be clearer yet.

I say all will be made right if it goes well

but you should not believe me in this.

Phoenix:

So nothing changes really,

other than a danger walks

beneath my sun and upon my world.

I will heed your words and trust nothing.

Whatever this thing be, it must end here

and not be allowed to continue elsewhere.

Is this the way of new love?

Iosef:

I see him in the distance

but he does not turn when I call.

Is this the way of new love?

Nothing has changed for me.

When I see him my heart still sings

so why does he no longer care?

He found me and made me whole

and I was his future, so he said.

Is this the way of new love?

No one will say where he goes

and no one will say why this is so.

Does he no longer care?

I am not so fickle as to give up.

I will search out the truth and know

if this is the way of new love.

The Sleepers

Upon this bed a body lies sleeping,

a smile lingers on its lips,

a smile reflected

by the body's repose.

Is it a memory of last night's passion

that is written in that smile

or does it tell a different tale?

If the sleeper ever wakes

then we may know.

And this may be true

for all the other sleepers

strewn carelessly,

some say wantonly,

throughout this realm.

Some say they dream

that they walk upon a distant shore

beneath a gentle sun

and will never return home.

These sleepers sleep like innocents

taken from life for no known reason.

They are old and they are young,

they are fair and they are dark

they strong and they are weak.

They were happy and loved life.

They laughed throughout the day

and they laughed together at night.

Now they have sleep in common.

## Part Four: The Body Thief

Love Burns Bright

Mercuri:

Come with me

I will show you my world.

It is a place of wonder and of knowledge

A place of rivers and of woods,

a place of art and of science.

It is the place where I live.

It is the place I would have you live with me,

the place I would share with you.

I will not ask you to stay

if you must follow your dance

to some other place far from here.

But here is my love, my heart,

my trust and my life.

They are yours already,

they cannot be returned,

they will always be entwined with yours.

They burn bright for you

and they would fade away

could they be left behind.

But with you they will always be true.

They will always try to warm your heart

should you ever be lonely.

Kindra:

What do I know of love?

I know that my heart feels it could burst

I know that this has never happened to me before.

I know it is something I would give up my dreams for

I know it is something that would not ask me to.

What do I know of you?

I know that you make me catch my breath.

I know that you make me feel so safe.

I know that you would let me go.

I know that you would come with me if I asked.

What do I want to do?

I want to be with you in every way.

I want my dance partner to be you.

I want to dance with you through time.

I want you and you alone.

What do I want from you?

I want you to be with me forever.

I want you to love me forever.

I want you to dance with me forever.

I want you in every way forever.

The Power of Number

Two brothers have a new project

not one they chose but one that chose them,

one that may have number at its heart,

one that dates from their opening of a door.

They do not believe in coincidences

they only believe in the numbers

that fuel the engines of existence.

They will unravel this thing

which takes their friends and locks

them up in a sleep from which death

seems to be the only escape.

They will know this thing.

They will plot its vectors,

know its permutations.

They will work to cancel it out,

they will do whatever it takes.

They will remove this blight

from their home and from their lives.

They will rally what remains

of their friends and work together.

They will measure and gauge,

they will test and they will model

a number so tuned it will shatter

this threat into the smallest digits of all.

Tears of the Phoenix

How many have fallen so far?

She dare not count

but she must know.

She will collect them up

and bear them to the fire

from which there may be no return.

How many have still to fall

she cannot tell.

She cannot see for tears

but she knows she must look.

She will have them borne to the fire

from which they may not ever return.

How many will have fallen

when this has come to an end

she cannot predict

but she must read the signs and know.

She must be prepared to take all

into the fires of no return.

The Right Touch

Let me touch you here

Does it feel good?

What about here

and here as well?

Move your leg a little.

Nice isn't it.

Now let's try this.

Tell me what happens

when I do this?

Does it feel good?

Now try it with me

Yes, that's good.

Try a bit further over.

Yes, that's really good.

Do it again . . . hmm.

Turn over,

I've got one more thing to try.

Are you comfortable?

Relax, you'll like it.

I'll let you sleep when I'm done.

Here it comes.

Ah yes. That was good?

It was good for me as well.

Now sleep, you can do no more.

Who is next I wonder?

Where Is He?

Iosef:

We work day and night to solve this thing.

Everyone works so hard but one.

Where is he? He has not come.

He would lighten my heart, if he were here,

If I knew he still lived.

But I must work at this thing in ignorance.

Curi:

Take a moment to look for him.

Take Kindra with you while we break to eat.

Check everywhere you have been together,

See if anyone has seen him.

Speak to the priests at the temple,

But keep each other safe.

Kindra:

I have still to meet this man of yours.

Let us go together, maybe the dance will help.

Let us ask the phoenix for her help.

The temple is near by.

We can step out of time as we search

and pass by all unseen and safe.

The Search

The temple is near empty as most hide in their homes, too afraid to brave the open spaces. Some hide alone, afraid of everyone they know. Others throw caution to the wind, party and screw around

in any way they can.

A priest greets them as they enter.

"Can we speak to the phoenix, we seek word of the acolyte Angel?"

"I do not know if she will reply as she weeps for all those who are suffering. But, yes, please go ahead"

The oracle sits silent and still in her chair as they come near. Her head is bowed and sorrow furls her brow.

They draw nearer and whisper in her ear. "We are looking for one of your students. He is called Angel. Can you tell us if he is safe. We think he can help us in our search.

"We search for a solution to this plague that moves silently amongst us."

The oracle stirs and looks them in the eye. "Dragon child and the child of time, I will see what I can do for you."

She shuts her eyes and moves not at all.

Minutes pass before the oracle stirs again. "We have been remiss, we had forgotten our son with all those this dire sleep has in its grasp. He has not spoken to us since the trouble began. We cannot hear his thoughts other than a murmur. It is as if he speaks from afar. He lives "maybe but other than that we cannot say. Has he been sent away? Had he reason to run from here before even the first sleeper was found?"

"No, I do not think so. No, not at all. Thank you, Tulintu. We must move on."

"Counter, know that the phoenix is grateful for your help. She will watch for him and will provide what help she can in your struggle to solve this curse upon us. Dancer, take care. Tulintu sees a trial lies ahead for you and a decision will be needed soon."

Iosef and Kindra bow their heads and move to leave.

A young priestess moves forwards and escorts them from the temple. "You are Iosef, are you not?

You look for Angel, I hear."

"Do you know where he is?" asks Counter.

"I had not seen him for many days but I think I saw him enter the dormitory across from the park just an hour ago. He was with someone, they were laughing. You may find him there still. His room is on the first floor, the one at the end"

"So he is safe. We will go there right away. Thank you."

Kindra turns to Counter. "I am afraid. What do you think the phoenix meant? What is this trial and this decision I must make?"

"I do not know but the three of us can face it together as before and come through again."

Amarillary - Part 1

The sphere of spheres and gears turns,

spins, throwing out a rainbow of stars.

The jewel at the centre crackles unheard

beneath its bell jar cover of glass.

The numbersmith stares at it and wonders.

"What secrets do you hold.

You are such a pretty thing,

you just ask to be touched.

"Did you cause this evil thing that blots our lives,

taking away our friends in such a cruel way?

Or are you just here by chance,

though a trap unsprung it is true.

"That is what you will remain:

a thing of such unparalleled beauty,

poised to snap shut tight

upon some unwary hand.

"What would you say,

if speak you could,

and what would you do

should I lift your lid?"

The spheres spins faster

and pulses of light illuminate the room,

tempting, daring him to do this thing.

He stretches out his hand.

The House of Sleep

No one answers the knock on the door.

There is no one there. The dancer checks,

reading the ghosts of those who passed this way.

No one has been through this door,

not today and not yesterday.

He did not come back to his room

but he was seen somewhere near.

It is a puzzle and it is a concern.

They turn back the way they came.

The counter looks for a sign,

a perturbation in the flow of numbers,

searching for fragments that may

show which way he passed.

The dancer changes the dance and takes them

a step out of the dance of today

that they may flick the moments back and forth

as Counter looks for a clue.

They pause at a door that stands a little ajar.

It swings open at a touch no more than a breath

and reveals a bed and a sleeper within.

Another sleeper lying naked and lost.

Counter would hide this from Dancer

but she pushes in and looks on with tears

flowing down her face.

So this is how it is then.

She had not seen before,

she had not asked,

it had not seemed right to interfere

but now everything has changed.

Is this a loved one, just fallen asleep,

dreaming of her lover just departed?

No lover would leave her so exposed

but would have covered her

to keep all chills away.

A lover would have swept that lock of hair from her face

with the gentlest of caresses and a kiss.

But this was no lover to be satisfied with a stolen kiss.

Counter draws a sheet gently over the sleeper.

Dancer sits beside the sleeper and touches the sleeper's face.

It is still warm, a tear has left a track

that follows the gentle smile that lingers.

The sleeper's chest does not rise and fall

Dancer feels as if she is in a snapshot

of two parents looking at their sleeping child.

She stands and takes Counter's hand in hers.

She whispers in his ear and he nods.

The time dancer stills her thoughts,

she selects a slow dance.

The seconds line up facing the minutes.

The seconds begin to turn hand in hand

while the minutes circle them

and, bit by bit, she rebuilds the hour that has gone.

An Hour Bygone

Zero minutes past:

The dancer leads time about the dance floor.

Time swirls and steps back the way she has come.

Ten minutes past:

The dancer and the counter look sadly at the bed.

Fifteen minutes past:

An empty room but not an empty bed;

there a sleeper lies naked and still.

Twenty minutes past:

The woman sleeps as a her double dresses and departs.

Twenty five minutes past:

She is smiling but her eyes are shut.

An unknown naked man kneels on the bed by her side.

Thirty minutes past:

He looks into her eyes and lowers his head

as if to kiss her open mouth.

A forked tongue frozen as it darts from between his lips.

Thirty five minutes past:

Naked on the bed they thresh and turn,

enjoying each other's body.

She strokes his chest

He nibbles her neck.

Forty minutes past:

two lovers undress each other

nuzzling and laughing,

all at ease with each other.

They throw their clothes away

no thought to where they fall.

Forty five minutes past:

the young woman sits on the bed

and the dark haired young man

drapes his arms around her,

whispers in her ear.

She smiles and nods.

He laughs and hugs her.

Fifty minutes past:

on the dresser there is a photograph:

a young woman holding hands

with a dark haired young man

stand between an older couple,

all smile proudly into the lens.

An hour past:

just an empty room and an empty bed

and on the bed a child's toy lays,

well loved and well patched.

An Uncomfortable Truth

Iosef:

Something is not right,

something is not as it seems.

What can it be?

Can you pinpoint and run the moment

when the man becomes the woman.

Let the seconds drag their feet

so every change reveals itself.

Let the clock click so very slow

to see if there is something to be seen.

Maybe here. Pause it now.

Let us approach the figure and see.

What numbers are at play?

What is the number of this beast?

Not one but many stacked

one upon another.

Numbers overlay each other

as in a pack of cards.

Which card tells the truth?

I'll deal them one at a time,

face up and see which one

is out of place, is out of time.

Ah, this one looks familiar.

It is not one I know

but I feel I should.

The thing that drew us here.

I shall mask out some digits

and see what remains.

I'll tweak it here and there

and let the consequence

unwind before our eyes.

There, can you see?

Another person stands

before us, frozen in time.

I know this one, it is true,

though it breaks my heart.

See, here he is.

You have not met

but you will know him now,

the one I love, loved,

a monster now unveiled.

Amarillary - Part 2

A roar rings in Curi's ears

freezing his outstretched hand

just as his fingertips touch the glass.

"No further, my son, pull back now,

as you know you should.

I would not lose you yet, if ever.

"This toy is more dangerous

than you could know

but I see it has a use

"not yet uncovered.

You should keep it safe

until the time is right.

"You will know when this so.

Trust your skills and knowledge.

It's key must be uncovered

"and then you will know

how to proceed.

I am watching you all

"as the moment of danger

approaches so very fast.

Tell no one of this

"as surprise will be a weapon

to ensure our success.

Farewell my son."

Curi wakes as if from a dream

to see a fading shape all in flame

reflected in the bell jar glass.

His Dark Hair

His dark hair hides his face

as he lies sleeping upon his bed

but all who see him understand

this is not a sleep to relish.

His dark hair hides his face

as he is carried away gently, to lie

alongside his bride to have been,

now sleeping that same sleep.

The Dancer Returns To Her Lover

The dancer finds her love in his room alone.

She goes to him and puts her arms around him.

She must tell him what she has seen

but does not know how to begin

as every word threatens to end in a sob.

She cannot speak but she can show him.

She pulls him to his feet and dances

those painful steps of what has come to pass,

with him held as close as she can.

She can let the dance unfold with eyes fast shut.

She need not watch the scenes as they stream past

but the numbersmith must know all that has gone,

all that has been lost and all that may still be lost.

She knows that he will have to go, leave her here,

and to whom he must talk and what pain they will share.

So this is the bright world she has come to

for such a bright future and the chance of love.

Bright like a falling star as it burns up in the sky.

Bright like a lightning strike and the fire it starts.

Bright like the smile on a lover's face, not to be missed.

I Fear For Him

Curi:

I fear for him

he has closed up again

he refuses to speak

he will not sit and talk

I fear for him

I fear for him

I fear for all he loves

and for all we love

if he will not sit and talk

I fear for him

Running Away / Climbing Above

The runner clambers up the rocks,

searching for something to take him away

from the sorrow he would hide from all around,

from love forever more,

from this pain forever more.

Has he been this way before?

He does not know,

he does not know what to feel,

he does not care what others feel.

He does not want to be with those who love him.

He does not want pity,

he does not want sympathy,

he just wants to be alone.

He just wants to be made of stone,

like this stone he climbs upon.

He does not notice the rain,

he does not notice the cold,

he does not notice the fire in his tracks.

He does not notice the steam that shrouds his passing.

He does not notice the flames he breathes.

He does not see the dragon wearing his shoes.

He would climb above these clouds if he could.

He sees without seeing the moon rise, the stars wheel across the sky.

He would open his wings and fly away

if he could be the dragon that throws his shadow.

A Darkening Heart

One last hoist and the summit is reached.

The dragon son lies panting,

his chest straining in the thinner air.

He sits up and looks

into the darkening sky.

"Why is he doing this?" he shouts.

"Why does he go from one to another,

stripping away all dignity,

cheating the loved out of love.

"Why does he do this,

my gentle and kind lover,

the keeper of my heart

"and I of his, or so I thought?

How does he do this terrible thing?

Why did he leave me to live in pain

"while others he has cruelly taken

and draped across the altar

of deadly and unending sleep?"

The counter slumps upon the rock,

he would cry if he had not cried

all the tears he could find inside.

He pauses as if he listens for an answer,

upon this summit, where there cannot be one.

He is ready to listen and there are those ready to speak.

But is he ready to hear?

Does he fear what he may learn?

There are two waiting, ready to speak.

"He is not the one," the dragon says.

"There is a darkness upon him that would spread

its fingers far into every atom of this world

"but some light still persists even now.

You must do what you can to protect it.

Trust what you felt, no lies were told."

"No. It is not him," the phoenix agrees.

"You have uncovered where the foe has made its home

and we may still turn back this tide of death.

"No promises can be made as to whether he can be saved.

We cannot say whether much of who he is remains

but you must save the memory of him if nothing else."

"Yes," the dragon says. "Do not leave your hearts

in this dark and dangerous place.

You must fight to get his body back

"and then it can be laid to rest

if nothing else can be done.

Be strong and be true.

"This foe, this demon, is old and wily.

It will need all your skill and knowledge,

together with those of all who will help.

"This thief of love, this trickster of disguise

must be stopped and sent on its way.

It was never born and may never die.

"It may be wiser not to try

but that way leads to death as surely

as night follows day."

Counter is now alone beneath the stars.

His heart is dark and will get darker still,

but it is a darkness made of anger,

a darkness made of a bitter resolve

to wrest at least two souls from a pit of despair

and to set one free upon the winds

of his love, carry it to some peaceful place

where it will wait for him to follow

when all this sadness comes to an end.

## Part Five: Kalidóttir (Daughter of Time)

Circle of Sleep

Scene: Curi's room. The two brothers and Kindra sit on the floor. Between them is a map of the University town. Numerous scraps, notes, sheets of paper sit in small piles next to them.

Counter has recently returned from his mountain climb, calm and resolved to see this thing through.

Counter:

"We must do what we must do. Do not worry about me, I know what must be done. I must try to release Angel from his torment, whatever that might involve, whatever the outcome.

The phoenix will do what she can but if he is gone then he is gone."

Numbersmith and Dancer nod sadly in agreement.

Counter:

"What have you found out? What do we know about the attacks, is there a discernible pattern?"

Numbersmith:

"The sleepers seem to fall within a circle a kilometer wide, a circle centred on the Park of Promises. . . ."

Curi pauses aware of the significance of the park to Iosef.

Iosef continues for him.

Counter:

". . . . where I met him and where we spent so much time. That can be no coincidence. Maybe that is where he can be found? I will go there and wait for him, try to capture him and end this terror."

Numbersmith:

"Is that wise? He may be avoiding you if he has access to Angel's memories."

Dancer:

"I'll do it. He does not know me. It has to be me."

Numbersmith and Counter, together: "No!"

Dancer:

"It must be me. What else would work. Who other than me has a chance of success? We can take every precaution, we can work out a plan of attack. I can play out the scenarios and see what may work."

Numersmith:

"How can you be sure it will be safe? I cannot face losing you now I have found you. I cannot live without you should we fail."

Dancer:

"If we do nothing we will lose all we have. We cannot run away from this, if we are in any way responsible. These last few days with you make me hope for more, but if that is not to be then I have those to treasure."

Counter:

"I do not like this plan but let us check it out. Let us examine how this can be achieved. Let us work through all the nooks and crannies of what could go wrong and see if we can shore up every weakness. We can then say yea or nay."

Numbersmith:

"I will go along with this that far. Beyond that I cannot and will not say."

Dancer:

"Come away with me and we can speak. I will try to put your fears to rest."

The dancer leads the numbersmith from the room, leaving the counter looking after them.

Amarillary Part 3

Counter is drawn to a shelf

What is that glow upon that shelf?

What is it that sits beneath a cover of glass?

Ah, it is you, armilla, devil toy.

I wonder why I forgot to cast you away.

I wonder why you are still here.

Can you still have a part to play?

What numbers do you employ

in your game of entrapment?

Can I turn them from their evil intent

to a similar goal that would suit our need.

Let me see what I can see

as I spin you round in your prison.

There is something hidden within.

What is it imprisoned within these spheres?

Some sprite or faery chained and manacled?

You do see me, don't you, whoever you are?

Can we two broker a deal to suit both our needs?

Is there something you would have?

Will you ensorcell something for me

if I promise to set you free?

I will leave you to consider awhile

and then we will speak again.

Until then I will cover you with this cloth.

You remember it, do you not?

You cannot penetrate its weave, so sleep.

Daughter of Time

Kindra leads Mercuri into her room

Sit with me

and I will show you

pictures of what lies ahead

in this most difficult time.

Hold my hands so tight

and you shall

see

all that could

be. We will walk the

twisting and diverging paths

wherever they may lead us.

Hold on tight, my love,

and fear not.

I

will take us

down the possible

and the most likely of ways

that will open up if we choose

to take the path we

three spoke of.

We

shall see how

they branch, split and fork.

We shall see what dangers lie

ahead and what perils lurk,

ready to pounce on

all who may

be

unprepared.

But there is more than

that. We can see what may be

should we look for other ways

to achieve success

in this thing.

Amarillary Part 4:

Two Sets of Questions

1

Can a thing brood?

Can a gem reflect shadow?

Can a made thing hold so much power?

Can a deal be brokered with such a thing?

It seems that it can and a deal is made.

Will there be a cost to the parties involved?

Will they trust each other and honour the bargain?

Will there be a consequence should all not go well?

Will they regret that they entered into this agreement?

It seems that it may be so, for good or for bad.

2

The thing locked inside the gem waits.

Who knows what it is?

Jinn or imp or something other?

It waits in something like hope.

Hope? It had forgotten there was such a thing.

Could it be that it will relinquish this cell, the gem at the centre?

Could it be someone or something will take its place.?

It waits in something like trust.

Trust? It has not felt such a thing in centuries.

Does it think trust is foolish for one such as it is?

What does it care should they attempt to trick it?

It waits in something like anticipation.

Anticipation? Aye, a hunger that makes it drool.

What does it expect in payment?

What will it do if they fail in what they plan?

It waits in something like conviction.

Conviction? Aye, it is sure of two things.

It will be free and someone will take its place.

It will be free whatever the outcome.

It waits, patient like death.

Bait

Countdown from 5

5

Something stirs in its lair,

high up in the hollow bole

of an ancient tree

just breaking into blossom.

It uncurls and stretches.

It sniffs the air and smiles.

Such a beautiful world

it will be sad to leave.

Soon it will have taken all it can.

Those who remain will not venture out.

They will not come to their doors

not even to let their loved ones in.

Soon it will sniff out another door

and slip away from this world.

It will find tender morsels

on some other plane.

Soon but not yet.

It looks out upon the greenery

and spots breakfast

sitting upon a park seat.

4

A girl sits looking out at the spring growth.

No one else is about, all is peaceful.

A gentle breeze lifts strands of blonde hair

making a halo in the morning sunlight.

She watches the birds on the grass

as they peck and feed on the grain

she has sprinkled all around.

A peacock displays and geese mow.

Ducks and pigeons mill around

as if dancing their own steps.

Doves coo and court in a pavane.

Pheasants circle in a minuet.

All make way for the man

who treads carefully across the grass

towards the seated girl.

He smiles and asks if he may sit.

3

She looks up and nods.

He sits and comments on the weather.

She replies, watching him closely.

Is he the one? she wonders.

Second by second time stretches out.

He does not notice and continues

to weave his web of deceit.

She encourages him bit by bit,

watching his face closely.

His features change little by little

Who does he think he needs to be

to get her to submit to his request?

2

She dare not slow time more

as she matches his crawling speech.

Who is it he thinks he has become

with that mask he now wears?

Is this what he has read from her?

Ah, yes, she sees it now, so subtle,

so clever, she may have been fooled

had she not watched this scene before.

1

He leans forward to whisper.

"Come with me," he says.

"We can go somewhere close,

have breakfast and some fun."

0

Kālī's Daughter

A moment she stands with him

before she steps back

and beyond his reach,

beyond his space and his time.

She completes her solo dance.

She has him now.

What will she do?

Should she leave him frozen?

Should she run his life

so fast he crumbles

into dust at her feet

before blowing in the wind?

Should she send him

down a path so dark

he will never see light again

or one of fire and death?

Should she make him howl

and beg for forgiveness?

Should she crush his life

at the moment of his genesis?

She knows what she must do.

She will confront this thing as planned.

She reveals another dance

with other dancers awaiting their turn.

The Scourging

Three dancers are poised on the edge of time.

Their steps are slow and so considered.

They slowly turn around the thing

at the centre of their dance.

It watches in fascination.

It knows no fear.

It is hunger

and

it is greed.

It is full of guile

and deceit. It is full

of tricks. It is the trickster

and it thinks it knows all there is to

know and more about the living and all

their trifling needs, their desires, their dreams.

The dancers watch it as closely as it watches them.

It does not know them like they will know it.

They build its profile as they turn about;

one that is built of observation;

one that's built of out if its

past, its present,

its future;

one

built of

its measure,

its ways, its moments,

its number and its physics.

As it watches it is savouring thoughts

of each performing naked beneath its gaze,

and how sweet they will taste later, when exhausted.

Will they question it, give it a chance to leave the body

it has stolen or will they just act as if it does not

have any rights? That's a question they must

ask themselves now it or he stands

before them, smiling such

a smile they are

tempted

to

mirror it.

The answer may

break their resolve but

ask the question they must if

they are to proceed. And how will they

gauge the answer from watching this thing

that looks out from the face of someone they love.

But they are not alone, these three. A dragon lives

in them and he will share in the judgement.

He may not speak but he will act as he

sees fit. He watches like them

and he waits like them.

Time is on their

side and

they

will use

as much as it

takes to crack the shell

this thing has erected about it.

They have its measure and its number

and they can attempt to break its hold by force

if it will not depart, leaving their friend whole once more.

"Will you release the one you inhabit, set him free,

and leave this world never to return again?"

"Can I leave while I can smell the life

that flows beneath your skin?

I would have you all.

You may sate

my ache

for

flesh and

for mind and for

life freely given. I do not

steal, I persuade and I pay well

for what I take. All I leave behind bear

a smile of such satisfaction at their passing.

I do not take, I am gifted with their sweet life breath."

"But what of this body you wear? Did you earn the right

to walk in his place or did you steal it from him

as he slept distracted by dreams? Tell us!"

"He slept, it is true but his body

has shared in my feast,

in all the rutting

and in all

the

sweet joy

I have brought to

your citizens, the lonely

ones and the ones empty of joy.

I have given them a reason for being,

for giving up the gift of life they did not want.

They all have made my life full of wondrous delights."

"Let him speak. We would hear his testimony on this.

You must leave this place. Let him choose his

fate. He may leave with you or stay here

with those who love him but he must

be heard. He must prove your

words true or you must

leave alone

and

that must

be soon. Let him speak

and let him speak now. We will

hear his words. We will know his part

in your foul rampage through the innocents

of this world of ours. You must let him speak to us

now or you will find out what we can do to make you pay."

"Sadly he sleeps. He has eaten well, he cannot be woken.

I'll not disturb his sleep. What care I of your threats?

I am the eater of souls and I share in all your

passions and your pains. I relish all

you feel. Pain has a savour all

its own. Do what you will.

This body may

suffer

but it will be

my pleasure to share

it's pangs." The thing throws

back its head, howling with laughter.

Tears run down its face. It wipes them away

and scowls at the three. "No, you shall not speak

to my companion. He will not speak even were he awake."

The three dancers confer and then turn back to the figure

shackled by frozen time. The girl gestures a sign

and the men reveal the devices they hold.

The watching thing experiences

something strange like

a quickening of time.

Its body sags,

ages

before them,

wrinkles spread across

its face, hair greys and fades

yet the smile remains. Joints swell

and veins erupt. Jowls form and eyes yellow.

Yet still the thing smiles and drools. It's teeth blacken,

decay. It begins to cough but this does not stop its laughter.

The two begin to adjust their devices. One holds an abacus

while the other displays a slide rule. They change

the settings, looking for some way to break

the hold of the creature living inside

their friend. The figure twists

and turns yet smiles

still. "Let us

speak

to the one

you have trapped

inside his own body. We will

cause this body to change to stone

if you will not do this thing for us. We will

fill your heart with molten lead and your veins

with acid. We will take your number and cancel it out."

"Do this and this body will also cease to function as well.

You will kill this body and what remains of him you

say you cherish. You can do nothing to me

that will not also damage the thing

you say you love. Fools"

Howls of laughter

ring in their

ears.

The dancers

reverse their steps,

changing the creature back

to what it was. Its laughter builds

and then pauses as it realises what's afoot.

It shrinks as the years fly from its body. It is a youth,

and now a child. "Shall we continue to you are but an egg?"

"Do that and still you will have lost. Yet I will remain as I am,

a thief of time. I have always been and always will be

You will lose, no matter what you try and do.

This is how things are. Let me go and

I will spare you for now but I

will keep this body as it

serves me

well."

The abacus

is put carefully away

and its owner moves towards

the thing. As he moves the earth beneath

his feet begins to burn. "You may think you have won

but I beg to differ. I cannot let this be. I cannot let you keep

the one you hold and I cannot let you roam free no matter the cost."

The dragon's son forces the thing to look into his eyes to see

what lies ahead for it. The creature shudders and cries

sinking down to its knees. "No, that cannot be.

How can you do such a thing as I see?

You would not survive such

a fire as you show me."

"No, that is so

but

what need

I to survive if you

take away my reason

for living. I would rather burn with

what's left of him than let you foul his life

and his memory with your blood stained hands.

There is not time left. Leave this body now or I will burn

"every instance of you from the annals of existence,

I will wipe your smile off the face of time.

It is now that you end this or I end

you. These are your choices."

The dragon dancer steps

back and away

to stand

again

with his

friends. They join

hands and surround it,

the thing of hate and of spite. Its eyes

dart but it can find no other escape. It shudders

and collapses. They rush forward to lift up their friend

and do not see a sly and slithering shade flow between their feet.

Amarillary Part 5

1

The eyes in the gem watch and wait.

It sees the shadow slip away

from the turmoil of time.

The lizard shade does not see

the peacock-like bird resting near by

but the peacock-like bird sees it.

The eyes in the gem see the bird

dart forward and grab the reptile

by its head. It shakes it hard

as if to break its back in two

and then it presents it to the gem.

A voice thunders down from above.

The ears in the gem hears the words

it has desired to hear for so long.

"Here is your replacement

and here is the key to the lock.

I unlock your cage of crystal. Now go

so we can fulfil the terms of the contract."

The empty cell in the gem accepts

its new guest and snaps fast shut.

The phoenix, for it is she,

and the dragon, for it is he,

look upon the creature before them.

"What now?" the griffin asks.

2

"This here is my world.

You are free to leave or stay

but if you choose to stay

you must live in peace

with all who live about,"

the phoenix says.

"You may guard my hoard of gold

if that is your wish. Come with me

and I will show you its extent.

It will surely satisfy all your needs

if peace and quiet are what you desire,"

the dragon says.

The three are silent while the griffin ponders.

It looks about it and then it speaks.

"Show me this hoard and I will then decide.

Let us depart together so you may tell me

all that has come to pass since my entrapment.

I will bring my old prison along to guard it as it did me."

3

The new prisoner of the gem looks out

upon all it has lost and screams.

It would have eaten this world

and the next and the next

and the next and the next

and the next . . . . . . . .

Phoenixson

There is one last sleeper.

All others have been laid to rest

but why not this one?

What is so different about this one?

The phoenix watches her son and waits.

She will list the reasons if you ask.

This sleeper does not smile.

This sleeper appears to dream.

This sleeper breathes still.

The phoenix sits beside her son all day long.

This sleeper does not wake

nor does he respond to her words.

Is he so different from the others

now laid to rest and mourned by all?

The phoenix listens in case he murmurs in his sleep.

She will tell what is different if you ask.

She thinks she failed him in his moment of need.

She forgot him when all was crashing down around her.

She did not notice his absence in her grief.

The phoenix cannot leave his side while he still breathes.

Nor can the counter, the dragon son who sits beside her.

Like the phoenix he blames himself for not being there

He thinks he may have caused all that has come to pass.

Grief would engulf them both, swamp them in a tempest of tears.

The Choices of Fire

1 - The Request

Kindra and Curi

"You do not know what you ask," she says.

"Yet I ask it still," he replies.

"I will show you the strands of time

so you may see how it could go wrong.

"If you wish to proceed you must trust my choices

no matter where they lead and what is lost."

"I do not ask for me. It is for them both.

I fear we will lose them if we do nothing."

"And I fear I may lose you if I do this thing.

What says the dragon and what says the phoenix?"

2 - The Temple

The temple is empty but for these four.

Numbersmith and Dancer stand together.

He rests an arm about her shoulders.

She listens intently while the dragon speaks.

"We can help him that is clear

but can we help both.

I would take the sleeping one from this world

and end his plight if you would but agree."

The phoenix shakes her head.

"The grief does not ebb so something must be done

but has it come to that?

What succour does time offer us?"

The dancer looks to the numbersmith.

He smiles and touches her face.

"Tell them what you have told me.

It is all that you need do."

"Angel is no longer a prisoner in his own body.

It's as if his mind has been cut free

from all its moorings and he has long gone

wherever the currents have taken him.

I have looked far into his future

and there is no change for better.

I can attempt turn back his clock

to before body thief took over his body

"but time will always be pulling him

forward to re-embrace his fate.

Any gains would be lost.

He would be lost yet again.

"I have walked many of his alternative lives

to see if there is one where his loss

does not impact on his world,

a world which will not mourn his absence.

We could steal such an Angel away

from such a world and drop him into ours

where he is sorely missed already.

Such a plan is not without risk.

"He may not remember anything of us

and he may never pick up from where our Angel walked.

Our Angel must cease to be if that is what we choose.

Can we do this thing if Counter agrees to it or not?"

"No, it seems wrong," the phoenix says.

"How can it be right to end

two lives in this way.

Let us wait and think on this."

"I will not wait long," the dragon says.

"My sons are not in harmony.

Their work and their lives suffer.

They both burn with sorrow. Is it not true?"

"I can wait though it pains me," Numbersmith replies.

"I would have us look further into this but

something else, something better may not turn up."

As they leave, the dragon catches the dancer's eye.

She will open up the message that look contains

when she is alone in her room.

She suspects she already knows its content.

She shivers and clasps Curi's arm tight.

3 - An Angel Walks A World

Kindra wakes from her sleep.

She does not know if she is dreaming

as a voice whispers in her ear.

"It is time. We await your presence."

She throws a hooded cloak over her nightgown

and hurries out into the night.

She enters the sleeper's room.

Counter looks up from his position by the bed.

The dragon looks out from his eyes.

"We do this thing now while there is still time.

You must be strong and you must sure.

I will follow where you lead

and I will do what must be done.

This is my decision alone"

The dancer calls time's dances into order

and sets them swirling one by one.

There are many but this night

will be as long as needed.

They watch as each dance flows across the floor.

They are patient and they are vigilant

as each dance spins fast then fades.

"See him there?" The dancer points.

"Let us watch where his journey takes him.

I feel it may end badly and alone.

I sense my goddess has picked him out to die."

They watch as shadows accrue along his path.

They pounce, draining life and possibility away.

They rend him to a mist of atoms.

"Why will this be so?" the dragon asks.

"I feel it may be due to what we plan to do.

We must proceed with care.

We must strew his life with so many choices

and false starts and trails that he can never be found.

If we leave him now his fate is sealed.

He is our Angel now, whatever the outcome."

Time tracks forwards and back,

turning off down a myriad of paths,

down lanes dark and others full of light.

The ways twist and turn,

some broaden into roads,

others end as mouse runs.

The dancer seeds the way with events:

messages are missed;

letters that never were suddenly are;

a date is forgotten and another is remembered;

a friend tells a lie and another forgets to fall in love;

an invitation to a party leads to a painful liaison;

a decision made in grief leads to career full of hope

somewhere that should not exist.

A wrong turn on a dark night brings an encounter

with a creature made of fire and dream.

"He is ours," the dragon says.

"He is on his way to take up his post

and he will meet whoever he will meet."

The dragon departs carrying a shadowy shape

off into the night, beneath the stars.

The dancer lets time resume its own pace.

The night slowly spins up to speed.

She settles in an empty chair

and waits by Counter for the dawn.

The bed before them is empty.

The crime has been done

and only tears are left to come.

4 - The Trial

The phoenix sits in judgement

but who is in the dock?

Can she try a dragon?

Can she try the ones

who follow his commands?

She may not have to

as the guilty and the innocent

punish themselves enough already.

The counter remembers it all as if in a dream,

as if he still walked in a nightmare.

He believes he saw himself cast

the sleeper into fire

but that cannot be so.

He sees his lover reborn whole,

rising from the flames

but this also cannot be so or can it?

And if not then what?

Can he face a life alone

with even more guilt

added to what already hangs

from the chains of loss about his neck?

The dancer does not hide her part in this.

She is the dancer of time,

the child of time and destruction.

She knew what it was that might need doing.

She warned this might be so.

She will face whatever is decided

and she will remember it all for eternity.

The numbersmith has done the maths.

He has made the proofs

and he stands by his love.

He accepts the verdict

although the crime will chill

his heart and bones

and add a shadow to the hoard

that find space in his soul.

The dragon did what he must do

and that is an end to it.

Let time prove him wrong or not.

5 - The Verdict

i

The phoenix knows what is done is done

and she finds she can live with that

but before she lets the dragon go she will know all

and she will go see for herself

ii

The phoenix slips from her world and makes her way

To a sad pile of ashes on some mountainside in some unreal place

A desolate place, a not anywhere place

A dragon world unknown to all other living things

Somewhere thrown together during a dragon's revelry

A fitting place for direst of deeds to take place

She hums an ancient air as she scratches through the ashes

Stopping every now and then as something catches her eye

But no it is not what she hopes for so she continues to scratch.

Ah yes she has found what she suspected all along

What she knew must be so

Whatever it is she has now found it

She lifts it to her eye

Dusts it off against her breast.

A bright flash and she is gone

Clutching a grain of light in her left claw

Leaving this funereal world of smoking pyre strewn mountains

Lapped by dead and oily seas, empty

6 - The Sentence

The Phoenix:

Step forward pilgrim

you have come far

not knowing your goal

but know this

this is now your home

all old ties have been cut

you knew this even before you knew of this place

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see there

Pilgrim:

I see fire, I see golden flames

flames of a fire that promises much

I see something I would believe in

Something I would pledge my life to

The Phoenix:

You are now the Phoenix's son

You are now Angel Phoenixson

Here, let me kiss your brow

You have now the Phoenix's blessing

On your brow is a star, brightly shining

It contains the essence of what I would have you become

It is more something for you to reflect upon, not to follow blindly

It will fade as it becomes part of you, more a flavour than a stricture

Now go and rest. Your room is ready as is your new life.

A Few Months On

"Is this seat free? Do you mind if I join you? My name is Iosef Dragonson. I've not seen you here before. Do you work in the university?"

"No, I'm about to start a new job. My name is Angel Phoenixson, I am to work in the temple to the two spirits."

"Can I get you something? A coffee or a beer?"

"Thank you, that is very kind. Bush tea would be nice, just as it is, nothing added."

"This is such a lovely spot, don't you think? You can see the whole park laid out below."

They look down and see the phoenix looking back up.

She spreads her wings out wide.

She throws her head back and sings a new song.

She shimmers like flames in the morning sunlight

as the song echoes like the chiming of bells,

golden and silver, for all who can hear.
