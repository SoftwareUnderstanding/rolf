NOTE:

_Spoken language, emoticons and original punctuation are used as a demonstration of what is typical for a casual, romantic correspondence style. We could have edited the sentences to be "boringly correct," and cut off everything that emphasizes emotions, but then your company may be truly surprised when you suddenly start speaking too formally. /smile/_

Feel free to change and add whatever you like to these "templates!"

COMMUNICATION TIPS

**_Samples of nice messages_**

_that you can use for dating site chats, etc.:_

  * Since I saw your profile today, I have only thought about you. I love everything you said in your profile. . . I like your photos a lot—you look so unbelievably beautiful, and that's my favorite type of look. From what I read in your profile, I can tell that you are also kind, very intelligent and a positive person. You seem, to me, incredibly special! ;-)

  * LIKE YOU, I'm a romantic and optimist in my heart. . . I can feel we have a lot of traits and interests in common, and a lot of different ones too—which is perfect, because it means we will never be bored!

  * Speaking about me, I am looking for the Big Love. Do you believe in Faith? I don't. . . I just believe that God has made a woman for me. . . and me for her. . .

  * I am on this site because I'm looking for a serious relationship, which means stability and harmony for me. I'm looking for my soulmate, for somebody very special to build a strong and happy relationship based on true feelings, trust, compassion and understanding. So why limit myself, and why not use all these opportunities and possibilities that International dating gives us? It's even more exciting going to another country to meet a woman, following my heart!

  * I can tell you secretly that some time ago I had doubts if this option of finding love overseas would work. But then I met my old friend who has been very happily married to a lady from your country for over ten years already. After hearing that, I decided to also try. If my friend managed to build a fabulous family, why not me?

  * I value intelligence, kindness, caring, thoughtfulness and the depth of a true relationship. I adore the mystery of a woman and everything it encompasses. I feel that if I find my other half I am ready to go to the end of the world for her! A man who is loved is a happy man; a woman who is loved is a happy woman.

  * I can see from your profile that your intentions and hopes are the same as mine, which is why I wish that you would find your soulmate. . . Maybe we will find what we're looking for in one another? : -)

  * I seek someone whose attractiveness shines from her heart—someone who has not lost the true values, and desires to share her future and destiny with one man only. . . Someone intelligent, educated, with a richness and depth to her emotions. Someone who will share the good and bad times. Someone who, when I look into her eyes, will take me away to a world of dreams. . .

  * You too are here on this site, searching—just like me. You are searching for your one and only. . . Maybe we are here to meet each other? I'd like to know much more about you!

  * When I came to the agency, I could see from their advertisement that it was called "A Bridge Connecting Hearts." We started walking on this bridge, so let us not stop halfway, but let us cross it together, all the way. . .

  * I am very serious in my search, and I seek a woman who knows what she wants in her life. Do you have a goal? What is your goal?

  * I hope that we will learn more about each other, and I expect that we could find many common points. What do you think?

  * You and I. . . We. . . Our. . . Us. . . Do you like these words? They sound better than I, my, me, and so on—don't they?

  * I want to say that I really noticed you. After having seen hundreds of profiles, I feel that my head is refusing to obey me. No, it is not an easy affair to choose a soulmate. :) Do you agree? But your profile really drew my attention among so many different ladies, because you seemed like an interesting person! Although I never pay too much attention to female appearances, I must say that you look truly stunning. . .

*****************************************

**_If someone has added you to their favorites:_**

  * Thank you so much for adding me to your favorites. It is really great to see that, and I appreciate your attention. Why did you like my profile? Did you like my pictures, or what I wrote?

  * Many times, I open my homepage and look at your profile. And every time, I ask myself why this amazing woman has added me to her hot list, but she hasn't written to me yet? I am waiting to hear from you, but it's hard to be patient. Do you have any idea how many profiles I read? How many hours passed before I decided to write to you? I was not just looking at the faces, but also trying to understand what each word and expression meant, and what showed in those faces, to see if the words and the picture reveal if this could be the one. . .

  * Hello! I can see that you have added me to your favorites. That's very precious!!! I appreciate your attention!!! Thank you!! Really, thank you!!! : -)

  * I was looking at your profile and sighed. . . Why do we have to be alone, if we can be together? You noticed my profile, you added me to your favorites, but you will not stop at this, will you? I am waiting for your reply and we can take the next steps together. . . believe me, your initiative will be rewarded! ;-)

  * I wrote a letter to you and you added me to your favorites. Thank you very much, that is really great! And now, I am thinking of what comes next. . . I would love to open up my mailbox tomorrow, to find a letter from you!!! =))

  * Do you want us to become friends, or do you want us to just admire each other from a distance? ;-)) We are both here on this site to change our lives for the better, to find our soulmates and to become happy. . . But nothing will change without our efforts, will it? ))

  * Thank you for noticing me on the site. =)) I liked your profile so much, and I read with a great deal of interest everything that was written there on your page—and your photos. . . my heart skips a beat when I look at them! ;-)

  * Re: Reveal the secret of your heart. . .

I want you to know that I am very happy that you have added me to your favorites. . . I like your face. . . when I am looking at your picture I always want to say something to you. . . and sometimes it seems to me that you answer me from your picture. :-)) Maybe it sounds stupid, but it's true. . . I feel that you are special. You are not like other women. What is the secret in your heart? Will you reveal it to me? Will you become a part of my life, or is this just a casual meeting? Tell me. . . I am waiting for your answer.

*****************************************

**HOW TO POLITELY DECLINE OR REFUSE**

·        «Dear. . .

Thank you for your message. I am very flattered and appreciate your kind attention. Unfortunately, I think that we may not be compatible. . . with much regret I must therefore decline your proposal for further correspondence between us.

Thank you again, and I sincerely hope that you find the person you are looking for sometime soon in the future.

I wish you good luck and all the best to you and your family.

Sincerely and warmly,

Xxx»

  * «Dear. . .

I think you are one very nice and beautiful woman with a romantic heart, but I am currently communicating with another person.

Wishing you all the best and good luck with your search for your soulmate.

With warmest regards,

Xxx»

**Examples of Men's Correspondence to International Women:**

«Dear Elvira!

Thank you very much for your reply. . . and thank you also for saying that you like my photos. They are, of course, very poor when compared to your lovely pictures!

If you would like to tell me more about yourself I would love to hear it. . . and I will be happy to tell you all about myself. So please feel free to write to me at this email address.

I have attached a couple of my "very poor pictures." I hope they are not too bad.

I look forward to hearing from you. Until then, I send you all my very best wishes!

Alex :-)

*

Dear Alex,

Poor resolution of pictures can't hide a really handsome man. . . and from your intelligent writing I can see that your attractiveness shines from your heart as well.

It is a joy to get acquainted with you. =))

Please tell me more about your life, your family, your dreams, thoughts and goals. . .

I will write more later.

With warmth,

Elvira

PS. My nickname is Ella, by the way. ))

*

Good morning Dear Ella!

Aren't you sweet to say such a nice thing!!!  _But I was not referring to the "poor resolution" of my pictures as compared to yours. . . but rather, the "poor" subject matter in my pictures, as compared to how beautiful you are!  But I humbly accept your very kind remarks! :-)_

I am going to sit down at my computer in a little while and send you a very long email telling you all about myself. . . you may even get bored reading about it all. . . but I will risk it.

So, I will send that to you a little later.

Until then, I send you my warmest wishes!

Alex

*

Hello again!

Decided to drop you a note before I go out to visit the opera house tonight. . .

I'm glad you liked the picture I sent of my cat, Randy. _He is such a great pet to have (although in his mind he is not MY cat. . . he is sure I am HIS human!!! ))) I got him when he was a tiny kitten that fit in the palm of my hand. He is now 14 years old, and as intelligent as he can be. He is also VERY spoiled. I wonder who did that? ;-)_

Thank you again for your two emails this morning. . . believe me, this was wonderful and the very best part of my day. And, needless to say, the photos you sent of yourself are extremely nice. . . you are, indeed, very beautiful and I can see that you have always taken extremely good care of yourself.

And if I may say it. . . your son Stephan is absolutely the most adorable little boy I have ever seen!!! You must be the proudest mother on earth to have such a sweet child. . . and the luckiest! :-)

Warmly,

Alex

*

Ah, Alex. . . what are you doing with my poor heart? ))

I agree with you. . . Will tell you more about my impressions on that matter in some of my next letters, 'cause now I have to get back to work. . . sigh. . . ))

And of course, I would gladly be your companion to visit the opera. The pleasure would be mine. =)

Warmly,

Elvira

*

Dear Elvira!

What a wonderful way to begin my day. . . with two lovely emails from you! And also such nice pictures. . . of a very beautiful woman (you), a precious little baby (your son), and some sweet dogs in your family. . .

I cannot wait to write more. . . unfortunately, however, I am just starting my day and the first thing I simply must do is run errands all over town. So, if you do not mind, I will write to you later this afternoon when I have more time to say all the things I want to say. . . okay? :-)

_(By the way, Ella. . . I live in North Carolina. . . not California. I'm on the East Coast of America - so my emails get to you quicker.) ;-)_

More to come later!

All My Best wishes!

Alex

*

Hi Alex,

Sending you some photos taken during my holidays last year. . .

I already told you a little about it.

With warm thoughts,

Elvira

PS. My favorite photos of you are from the conference. . . and the ones from your graduation ceremony. . . and. . . _ah, hell. . . they are all great!!! ;-)))_

*

Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well. . . Ah, hell! I like ALL of your photos, too! :-)

*

Elvira,

I just had time to take a really good look at all the photos you sent today. Your son certainly is cute in all of them. . . but I really like the picture when he was two-years-old. . . standing in front of you with a huge smile on his little face, holding his little stuffed animal and his "Happy Meal." So cute!!!  _(I think that one day, McDonald's will probably rule the world! I'm sure they are already planning to have a number of locations on the Moon.)_

And I really like your photos at the beauty contest. . . in your red dress. You look like Scarlet O'Hara from  _Gone with the Wind_  (a favorite movie of mine).

Thinking of you always. . .

Alex

*

Hi from Ukraine,

I've put a photo of your cat Randy as my LT screen wallpaper. . . and he looks so cute there. =)))

Thanks for sending another letter. . . this picture of you is also one of my favorite ones. . .

Mmmmm. . . tall man wearing a tie and business suit. . . what other combination could be more adorable. . . and make a woman feeling weak in her knees? ;-) ;-)

In reply to your question, I have so many happy moments in my everyday life because I see happiness even in simple little things that happen every day. Speaking of happy moments on special occasions, they have been my son's little successes (and there were so many), but I just don't know what was the happiest one. . . my child's happiness is always my double-happiness. )) Yet, some birthday celebrations have been happy moments also. . . and my graduation from school. . . and some really personal moments too. . .

And for sure, lots of my most happy moments are still in the future! :-))))

Warm thoughts,

Ella

*

_You put Randy on your laptop as your wallpaper?!?!?!?  He is VERY flattered!!! And he told me to tell you he appreciates it a lot! ;-)_

Well, if you like my photos wearing a suit and tie, maybe I can even do a little better. When we go to Washington next week I'll be wearing a tuxedo for a couple of events. . . and there will probably be a lot of photos taken, so if they take some of me, I'll be sure to have them send those photos to me, and then I'll send them on to you!

Awww! That's nice of you to say that your happiest moments are connected with your son. . . you ARE a good mom, Ella! :-)

Yours,

Alex

*

Hello Alex,

What I like about you, is that your replies are so prompt and so sincere. =))

You know. . . as for our age difference. . . I think that the ability to love and give your soul to each other doesn't depend on age. . . what do you think???

Also, as I am very serious about starting a family and I'm not a teenager, I would not mind being with an older man—who is more mature, wiser, more reliable, stable, loyal, caring and family oriented. (The majority of young guys are often hardly able to even take care of themselves; they mostly don't understand a lot of things about how to create a happy love relationship).

My man's heart, his word and his honor must be as good as mine.

We would care about each other from the beginning of our relationship, not just in words.

Words can be nice, but they are still nothing more than air—just wind blowing—unless they're backed up by one's behavior in real life.

Did you know that all men say the same things, using the same words and phrases when talking to beautiful women? ;-))

Yes, I totally agree that the right words in a relationship mean a lot. However, the biggest problem in the world is that too many words are insincere. That's why a wise person trusts someone else's actions more than their words. . . and expresses feelings with the intention of bringing more joy into each other's lives.

That is why one more thing I like to confirm: If one day I will tell you I LOVE YOU. . . you can be sure I will really mean it.

I will give all of my heart to a man who deserves my trust.

With tender thoughts,

Elvira

Good Morning Elvira,

So, now I will tell you about how I imagine a future wife. Well. . . I'm not sure that I would try to imagine any one particular "way of life" together. To do that would be to try and place each other in a box, from which neither person could grow and change. I think that two people who go through life together have to find their own way. . . a way that works best for them both, as a couple.

I do think it would be best if my "future wife" has her own life, and has a desire to fulfill herself and her own interests in the ways that make her the most happy. And, if she works and has a career, then I would encourage and help her to do this as much as I could. A person has to live their own life to its fullest. . . and if two people are married, then they should help each other fulfill their individual lives, and their life together, as much as possible. Certainly, I would want a wife who understands what I do and encourages my ambitions in life.

The short answer to your question is that I would want my future wife to be a complete person. . . happy with herself, and happy with me (and a big orange cat).

So. . . now can you imagine a future marriage with me??? ))

_Oh, and as a matter of fact, I do happen to know where you can find a man like the one you described. . . and I think he even has a big, beautiful cat. :-)_

With warmth always,

Alex

Hi Alex,

You are such a tender soul. . . and you are definitely also a strong and mature man. There's nothing wrong with being sentimental or sensitive, as we are people and not cold-hearted robots. . . we have our sentiments, dreams, desires and feelings. . . which is wonderful.

On the other hand, sometimes life seems a bit unfair. . . somewhere, someone always missed being the "little boy's daddy". . . WHILE somewhere else, someone always missed being the "daddy's little boy". . . but they never, ever had that. . .

Just a short note right now to say "hi" to you. . .

Because I have to run to meet my parents at the train station.

Will write more tomorrow. . .

May your day be nice and pleasant!!!

Warmly,

Ella

PS. You've got a great sense of humor! ;-)))

PSS. I've fallen in love with your cat already. =))

*

_Just my luck!!!  I meet a beautiful, intelligent woman and who does she fall in love with? My cat! Oh well. . . I really can't blame you. He is a very handsome guy and has a great personality!!! :-)) And he's also very sweet._ In fact, he is so sweet you would not believe what he did this morning: He caught a dove in the balcony and scared the poor bird almost to death. . . I had to be a rescuer to let the dove fly away. ))

_You see. . . I strongly believe, before you can be honest with someone else. . . you have to first be honest with yourself! Too many people in this world are NEVER honest with themselves. . . so how CAN they be honest with someone else?_

Of COURSE, no one is perfect! Myself, least of all. But what IS perfect is when two people are so in tune with each other that their "imperfections" complement each other. I sense this about you and I already.

Have a great time with your family, Elvira. . .

With warmest thoughts,

Alex»

«Dear Marina,

I must thank you again for enlightening my last two days in Ternopol with your presence.

I think you have been patient with me though. . . and I appreciate it very much.

I must say, since meeting you, my LUCK certainly has changed for the better.

You seem to be a lucky person for me!!

I am very happy that you were thoughtful enough to give me some photographs of your family and you. I have been looking at them a lot. . .

I do hope to hear from you soon.

Thinking of you,

Yours, Louis»

********************************************

«Oh Dana, this photo you have sent is beautiful!

You look like a film star! I love it. It's the best one yet.

It makes me want to jump on a plane and come to see you (that will happen, I promise)!

You are such a pretty woman! :)  
I'm not afraid of commitment, I'm hoping for a loving marriage. I'm attentive, affectionate, humorous, respectable, honest and up for anything.   
Honesty is critical. I want us to be sincere. At this point, I think that I know what is important to me: 1 - Honesty, 2 - Personality, 3 - Reasonable Intelligence, 4 - Mutual Attraction.

I believe other factors can be worked out through compromise.

Thank you once again for the lovely photo. You are so beautiful, Dana, you take my breath away!  
By the way, are there other names like nicknames for Bohdana besides Dana, that your family and friends use??? I just want to know everything about you. )))  
With affection,

Adam

Hello again Dana,

I have been thinking a great deal about our lovely conversation. It is so nice that we speak freely and honestly to each other. I like the fact that you know so much about life. It is so nice that you speak some English. . . I am working on my Russian. ))  
I want so much for us to finally meet. Only then will we truly know how we feel. That is the magic part. I want to look into your eyes and hold your hand.   
I will always be honest with you. That is an excellent start.

I will do my best to come and see you as soon as possible. You mean a lot to me now, dear Bohdana. I look forward to sharing more with you. . .  
With you in my thoughts,  
Adam»

********************************************

« **Re** : BBC Film Producer would love to be in contact with you. I swear you will never regret it.

Hi,

My name is Ronald,

I saw your photo on the site and wanted to write to you. (What man wouldn't?)

Well, I live in London, but also have homes in Italy, L.A. (USA), and Ireland.

I am a film/TV producer and writer.

I have written over 200 screenplays, I have produced about 100 TV shows and seven films.

I have also written over twenty books (mostly novels).

I don't say this to show off, but just to let you know who I am.

I am six feet tall, medium build, green eyes.

I love to cook, swim and write. I love to travel and spend much time in different countries.

Last month I went to the Oscars.

The film company, Paramount, found me a "date," which was okay, but it was then that I realized that I wanted someone to share my life with, to share experiences with.

I think you will love my homes and my friends. . .

I have many famous friends, but many ordinary friends too.

I would love to meet you and see how we get along.

I have been to Saint Petersburg in Russia before to make films, and love the city.

I would also like to know more about you and your daughter.

I love children, and am normally very good with them.

Please write back, and ask me as many questions as you like.

When you do write back I will give you my full name so you can check me out on Google and see that I am totally honest with you.

Hope I hear from you soon. . .

Ronald

Dear Veronica,

My God. . . I have never felt so close to someone so quickly. . .

What a wonderful family and daughter. . .

She will go far, we will make sure of it.

Yes, I have been to Holland many times, and made two films there.

It's very flat, but really wonderful.

Amsterdam is '"kicking." Very exciting place.

If this works, I swear to you now I will show you the world and love every moment of it.

I have been looking for a soulmate for such a long time. . . Maybe now. . . ))

Will write again soon.

Warmly,

Ronald

PS. The Dutch people are great—very warm and open. They will love both you and your daughter.

*

Hi Veronica,

Thanks so much for your letter.

You are so talented, and your daughter sounds amazing.

I can see her becoming very famous in a few years.

Well more about me. Yes, I have been married before.

We separated in 2009 and became divorced in 2011.

We get on very well although she lives in a place called Nottingham, approx. 200 km away.

We decided not to be angry with each other, because of the children.

She is now like a sister.

She has a new man, Alan, who we all like, and my former wife and he are very happy.

I have three children, David (25) a businessman who lives with his girlfriend in Southampton, Sonica (21) who is a fashion editor with a big magazine (also very beautiful) and Nataly (27) (another beauty) who has just finished reading English at Cambridge University.

I have attached a photo of me—the only one I can find for now but will send more later.

I work very hard and enjoy writing, however, I believe it is also important to find time for other things (otherwise I would go mad. ))

As you love all animals, I love dogs.

My last dog, "Ali," a wonderful Retriever, died two months ago aged 15 years.

I was very upset. . . he was wonderful. I want another one, but it's too soon at the moment.

I am a romantic, always have been and can't help it. I take after my mother who was a big romantic. )) She was also the one I got all my small talent from. She died several years ago and I miss her very much. She always made me laugh (my father died in 1993 and I still miss him as if it were yesterday).

I am very outgoing and love people.

I also think that family is the center of everything and should always be "number one."

I enjoy walking and have a small home in the Lake District, the most beautiful place in England.

I love to go there in the winter when it's cold and there are few people about.

I want to take you there, get you very cold then take you home to a large warm log fire and hot wine. (See, I am a romantic!) :-))

Writing is important for me, and at times I do need my space but I am always there for my family. Writing is my job, family is my life.

I am not perfect and sometimes make mistakes too. . . but I try very hard to correct those mistakes, or apologize for my stupidity. ))

I can see when I am wrong, and I'm not scared to admit it.

But I am also very positive in my life and work.

I was educated at the college in Cambridge and loved it.

Still go back there often, and am still a bit academic.

Well, cannot think of any more to say for now. . .

I will write again later in the week and send more pictures.

By the way, you and your little daughter are both beautiful and intelligent. . . what more could any man want?

I am so pleased you wrote back. . .

Warmly,

Ronald

*

Good morning Veronica,

Hope you are okay. I am always waiting for your letters. So far this has been wonderful for me.

_Two of your pictures are already with me everywhere._

_One by my bed and one in my wallet._

_So now I fall to sleep with you, wake with you and carry you everywhere. ))_

I think if you can get a Schengen visa, then we should meet for the first time in Holland.

I will take care of the trip.

You will have your own room, and will be treated with respect.

Thought it might be fun to meet in Amsterdam for the first time.

I know the city well from its culture to its very naughty bits.

I look forward to meeting the girl with the beautiful smile.

Ronald xx

PS. Love this photo of you, thanks. ))

*

Dear Veronica,

I am so pleased you wrote to me!! ))

I was beginning to get worried. . .

I feel the same as you. I want someone by my side in all things.

Someone to share my life. . .

I want to wake up next to you, fall asleep with you in my arms,

feeling safe and happy.

Knowing that no matter what happens, you are safe from trouble.

I want to make you smile and laugh,

I want to love you so much that I think my heart will burst.

I want to know you are there always,

never far from my touch or my thoughts.

I never want to be away from you.

I want to run my hands through your hair,

Feel your warmth next to me.

I want your life to be mine and mine yours.

As for nature, I love it. I have a small house in the Lake District, and

it's the most beautiful place in the world and you can walk for miles.

Like I said in my last letter, I want to walk in the cold, take you back to the cabin

and give you a warm massage, some hot wine. You will love the lakes.

Devon and Cornwall are also very beautiful.

Sea and hills. . . so many places to walk. . . so much to see.

For me, the truth is I just want to be loved as much as I want to love.

I'm a very romantic guy, as I said.

Yes, I hope this time I have met someone who will be my soulmate and share my life and my memories.

I would also like to be a good father to your daughter.

If this works (and I hope it does), she will have two new sisters and a new brother

and I am sure they will all love each other. ))

Write soon. . . I love the photos. . .

I have sent some more pictures of the children for you to see. . . hope you like them.

Thinking of you,

Ronald

*

Hello my girl with the beautiful smile,

I do understand and make you this promise, I will make sure that you see all these things,

Paris, Rome, Holland, all of Europe.

You will also be loved without having to sleep with me.

You will be loved for you, and who you are.

I will never leave you and your daughter, and will be there as long as you want me to be.

I might live in a "film star" world, but do not come from one.

My parents were working class people who worked very hard.

I have some talent for writing, which is the only thing that saved me.

So we are very alike.

I never lie. . . sometimes this gets me into a lot of trouble, but that's who I am.

I will never lie to you, so you always know who I am and what I am thinking,

even if you do not like what you hear sometimes. . . I am not the perfect man. ))

What I am, however, is kind, thoughtful, considerate,

I consider other people before myself.

I feel strongly in my heart that you are the one.

We have a lot to speak about, because

if we are going to make a strong commitment to each other,

then we need to know everything about each other so we can move forward together.

I will never stop writing unless you wish it.

I will be by your side forever if you wish it.

I will never let you down, always hold you close and protect you,

and make your life interesting and funny.

You will sleep at night wishing for the next day to start

because I will have made you so happy.

This is my dream for you. . .

You are so WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!

Hello from London,

I would also like to say that I love the things you say. Your mind and mine are very much the same. This is good. . .

Here is another photo of me, hope you like it. Hope reading the last letter made you feel better and made you see that this is not a game, and I do want you by my side always. . .

I am attaching the photo of me (on the right) and a friend of mine, an actor called Jack Nicholson. He is a nice guy and a great actor, we get on well but he's a little grumpy these days.

Write soon, my girl with the beautiful smile.

Yours always,

Ronald xxx

Hello Veronica,

Well what can I say. . . your daughter is stunning, just like her mother.

We need to get her into modeling and acting. . . she really has the look and the ability.

Have huge film meetings this week so I am going to be very busy. . .

So please forgive me in advance for the delay in writing.

The meetings are about the next four films, so they're important.

Yes you are right, personal happiness is about loving and being loved.

Finding that someone, that right person to share life with. . . who understands me, the good and bad, and says that's fine.

If we know and understand everything, then life will be good.

Nothing comes as a surprise later, we know each other and we accept it. All this must be done upfront so we can get it out of the way quickly and move on with knowing each other.

I want you here in England with me, and I want to be a father to your daughter.

I want to watch her grow. I want to be your husband.

The children say "hi."

Hope you are having a good Easter, and I will speak with you tomorrow.

Every time you write to me you sound so true. Love it.

Thinking of you,

Ronald»

********************************************

«Dear Rosa,

I like to tell you things as they are, and it is true that it is not so easy to have contact only by Internet without having real dates. . . Without entering into details, let's say that I really have a flash for you!!!

I understand I am not Brad Pitt, but I could have a lot of girls here if I wanted. . . I mean I have had my success. I am not the richest man in Belgium, but I am secure and cannot complain.

I have a good family and reliable friends around me. . . and everything that I have, I am ready to share and to offer the best things to my soulmate and my family.

The fact you have a son about same age as my children is very good—it means better and faster integration for language as well as friends, sports and contacts! ))

I will start to gather practical information about wedding, education, relocation. . . in fact all the necessary things to arrange when we feel it could work.

First a meeting. . . I will check it out—even the flights.

I imagine the solution is to meet in Odessa. . . What do you think of that plan???

Please let me know. . .

Hope to hear from you later today.

Yours,

Roman»

********************************************

« **Re:** You are gorgeous!

Dear Alisa,

I am very impressed with your overall beauty, elegance, and your kind thoughts and wishes.

It would be wonderful to get to know you, and maybe share in the near future our common dreams.

I am a 48-year-old divorced man, born in Mexico of Spanish decent; grew up in Mexico and Italy, and for a while went to boarding school in England. I have two wonderful sons, 16 and 15, now attending boarding school in Germany. I spend my time between Canada, Germany, England and Mexico.

I studied Law, but have been involved in business all my life, and now I am heading a group of companies involved mainly in engineering, construction and equipment manufacturing and finance. Three of them are based in Germany, two in England, one in Sweden and one in Mexico.

I have a good life, exciting work, and beautiful children, but would love to start a new family with a lovely woman, who would be my soulmate, companion and partner, someone I can trust and give all the love that my heart is capable to give. I would love to have more children, to fulfill all my dreams of having a family that I could be proud of. I am looking for a sincere and intelligent woman that appreciates loyalty, true values and family. . . one that is willing to share all and everything, as I am willing to do with the right woman.

I consider myself to be a mature, and at the same time playful, man. . . sincere, straightforward, romantic, passionate, adventurous, with a good sense of humor. I like the finest things in life, just as much as the most simple ones; I love art, music, literature, architecture, nature, traveling, learning, I am always open for new experiences in life, and at the same time very comfortable with stable situations.

I would love to hear back from you, and start an exciting and intriguing process to get to know you, at the same time disclosing all about myself to you.

I am seriously interested in you, please get back to me. . . I am prepared to travel anytime to meet you, and I hope soon we'll be able to develop more than a great friendship.

I enclose a four year old picture of me with my two sons, and two more with my other family members, so you'll know who it is that's interested in you.

Sincerely,

Andres

Message-ID:

My very dear Alisa,  
I was frankly taken by your letter, it is not common nowadays to read so much wisdom in such an open and warm way.

You have impressed me very much. . . not only that, but you have really opened my mind to such obvious realities of life.

Yes, I agree entirely with you—life passes so fast, and we leave our intentions behind with the complexities of living. And then we realize the best years of our lives are gone without all that really matters. . .

Like you, I seriously try to find that special soul that can make the rest of my life special. With her I will be far more happy, far more complete in all the sense of the word. Thank you Alisa, for appearing again in such an unexpected and wonderful way.  
It took me a few days to answer you. My apologies, I was on a very hectic trip in the USA. As you have pointed out, the current crisis has certainly put a big dent in my business life. I have a company that trades in the stock exchange and the share price has gone down to unimaginable lows. I was about to list another one, but the listing will not happen as the market has totally disappeared, and in such a circumstance I will lose a couple of years work and a big investment. Anyways, not all is so bad for me, and I also think the crisis will bring opportunities at the right time.

If you are interested in the subject, let me recommend the website of an economist I know well, and the only one that has predicted the chaos we are living in. His name is Lyndon Larouche and his site is www.larouchepub.com, it's an interesting read. . . well, in my opinion. ))

Thank you so much for the pictures of you and your little daughter Karina, both of you are lovely, special creatures of God!!! I can see that in your eyes and also in your words. You must be very proud of your child, she is your treasure and with her beauty and achievements she must fill your soul and life with the purest emotions. . . thank you for sharing such emotions about her with me.

Yes, I can certainly and will surely go to meet you in Lipetsk. Unfortunately it's Christmas already here, and I need to go to Mexico and China early in January, but will do it at the end of January at the latest, if that is good for you. In the meanwhile, let's try to communicate more often. . . maybe I can also call you. . . please let me know if you like the idea and let me know where and at what time I can call you.

As you know, I have two children. Ricardo, who already started University this year in London, and Roberto who is in a boarding school in the south of Germany. I am expecting to spend Christmas and New Year's with them. We have planned to go skiing in Austria from the 20th to the 27th, and then spend New Year's in Berlin with some friends. What about you? What are your plans?  
Alisa, you have really touched my Spirit, my Soul. . .

I want to meet you and explore the possibilities with you. I am sure that we will find we have many "matching clicks," as we share a view of life that is uncommon nowadays. . . and maybe we will find that upon seeing each other's eyes, a flame will ignite inside of us and love can come our way. . . I am totally open to it!!!  
The other picture I am attaching is the one I took from the plane on that same day, to share a beautiful sight I enjoyed from the sky. . . the day I was coming back to Mexico City.  
Look forward to your reply with real excitement. . .

Your admirer,

«Hi Laura,

I don't really know what to say. I am just so astonished and speechless. To be honest, I think you should become a writer!! You are very talented and when you write, I just thought of the way you formulate and express everything. . . There are so many feelings in your letter, dear!

Well, what to say. . . It's fantastic, emotional, sad, hopeful and. . . just everything.

I immediately connected with you when I saw your image and devastating look. I noticed something in your photo that intrigued me (besides your gorgeous physical features).

If that future could include a highly successful, experienced gentleman, then please review my Profile and consider if it interests you. . .  
I am a music publisher in New York. I publish many American composers, in addition to music for schools and churches. I am a composer also.

I am older than you (50 y.o.) but my friends say I have the soul of an innocent boy. I was married before. I love children. Now I am looking for the woman of my life who can be my future wife. I shall take care of her, respect her, honor her and devote my entire life to her happiness.

I know what I want, and how to treat a Lady. I have been fortunate in my life and career, and wish to share my life with an intelligent and beautiful Princess.

I hope that you feel it is time to receive the comfort and care of an experienced, successful, mature and respectful gentleman who loves family and honors his Lady.

I guess I am sort of a "producer" since I publish many videos and DVDs on music.

I am happy that you may appreciate the maturity of an older man.

I am the kind of man who would take care of you, give you my experience, help you in difficult situations, support you, nourish your soul, excite your mind, let your spirit soar and just love you. I am a strong man who is also tender, caring, loving, understanding and kind.

I imagine your presence, charm and great beauty are more than enough to fill a man (me) with happiness, peace and joy. Your words reveal a good and kind heart. Your photos demonstrate incredible beauty and womanhood.

I have been to Ukraine and Russia on business many times. I publish three Ukrainian authors in Kiev and represent two Russian publishers in Moscow. In fact, I was just in Kiev and Moscow three weeks ago on business. I truly like Ukraine and Russia. I think Kiev is much like Paris. . . so very beautiful. I get to Kiev and Moscow two or three times per year. I should be back in Ukraine, at the latest, in April.

All I do is work; hence, I have no time to socialize, which is one of the reasons I am on the Internet. I do not date women in my industry and field because I do not want complications in my professional life. Anyway, I am searching for an intelligent and beautiful Slavic Princess.

(I may have found her! ))

When I am not building my business, I compose music. I am a composer by training and that is my true joy. I am presently writing a piano concerto and some pieces for string orchestra. But my biggest creation is a ballet that I am composing. It has no name yet (maybe "LAURA") but is about a dancer/ballerina who leaves home to become a famous dancer in New York.

To write this music I must fall in love myself. I must have a Muse who will inspire me to compose beautiful, emotional music. I need to feel the joy and rapture of love.  
Maybe you are my Muse, Laura?

As you know, I am older than you, but I possess the soul of an innocent boy and have a very childlike view of the world and nature. I am searching for a woman who could and would make me forget about everything else in the world except for her. I am very romantic, understanding, educated, honest, caring, generous, tender and kind. I have learned that if you make your Lady happy all the time, your life is a Paradise. And I like Paradise. ))

I value intelligence. I value kindness, caring, thoughtfulness and generosity. I adore "womanhood" and everything it encompasses. If we should ever get together, I shall respect everything about you. I would honor you and devote my life to your happiness. My woman will be the Queen and Lady of the house, the social director for all the family and customary business activities, a listener and best friend for the difficult moments, a young "girl" to spoil, and a "buddy" to have fun with. . . there are many more areas than those, too. . .

Princess! My Gorgeous Blonde Princess!

Please send me your address, and I'll send you a CD of my music.

Your admirer from New York,

Ludwig

Re: The Center Of My Universe. . .

Dear Laura,

I wish to talk about someone who makes me happy. . . you!

You are magic, Princess. You have enchanted me, and are capturing my every attention. My mind wanders to you during the day. I try to imagine the sound of your voice, the tone of your laugh and the energy of your presence. I miss you and I haven't even met you yet!

Like you, I am looking for Mutual Love. Once Love is present and is in one's heart, life is so easy, the future so clear, and one's purpose is quantified and defined. If given the opportunity and if our relationship blossoms, I would try to create a "fairytale" life for you and our future children. It would be my pleasure and honor for you to be my Princess. I would make you feel like one and treat you like the Grand Lady that you are, as you would become the center of my Universe. You are a very gracious and lovely woman, and I think perhaps you may be "The Woman" who would be perfect for me and make me very happy, fulfilled and complete.

Your letter reveals a good intelligence, charm and a lovely soul. You write very well and I look forward to reading many of your letters! Your photos show a very feminine and beautiful woman who radiates Womanhood with your devastating look, deep and warm eyes and your hair that looks like a golden, silken fleece surrounding your gorgeous face like a royal crown. . .

When I look at your photos, I am in a spell. . . I am hypnotized. . .

Your words reinforce this magnificent impression and amplify the great beauty and femininity that you possess.

You are so very beautiful!

With deep affection,

Ludwig

Good Afternoon Dear Princess,

It may be the very thing we both need. . . each other. I am willing to try so much. . .

I have been trying hard to find my Princess for such a long time already. . . It is not easy. . . Considering that it is my priority and all I want is a younger, beautiful, blonde Slavic Lady.

Thank you for sharing the news from your life with me. . . It is still all the same over here, and nothing has really changed over the latest weeks.

The weather here is mild, around 19F (-10°C?) in the early morning and 40F (5°C) in the afternoon. The economic crisis here in America is not good, and it is embarrassing. To think that a group of greedy people on Wall Street lost almost One Trillion dollars throughout the world, and sank banks and people's lives is unbearable and despicable.

Everything will be okay, as the US Government is putting Seven Trillion dollars into the financial system and economy to get things going again, but I feel sorry for our grandchildren who will be burdened by the debt.

It is tough for me, as I am just starting a new business at this bad time. But I have confidence in what I am doing. Would you like to help me? I am afraid if we worked together we would not get much work done. . . at least, I wouldn't. )) I would just be looking at you all the time, trying to seduce you and make you fall in love with me. . . Who knows, maybe that would be the best thing, as you would make me go crazy over you and if you made my dreams come true, then I probably would work very hard to make enough money to provide you with everything you ever wanted.

You would be an "inspiration. . ." You would have security, comfort, the best opportunities, happiness and a man who adored you, and I would have the gorgeous blonde Slavic Lady I have always dreamed about in my life, by my side. . . . . . Perfect.

Thank you for the last two photos. You are so very desirable and beautiful, Laura.

Darling. . . I know you are a very special girl and you think I am a special man. I am flattered, still I instinctively feel that you are the most special of us two. You are lovely, intelligent, charming, caring, and so very gorgeous. You have always been special to me, as you possess everything I have ever dreamed of in a woman.

I have always wanted a gorgeous, clever, blonde, Slavic Princess. I have always wanted to raise more children.

I have always had special feelings about you. . .

In you, I see the woman who would make me forget about everything else in the world except for you. . . I want to be consumed by you, and I'm wondering if you could love me and embrace me to the end of time. . . In return, I shall devote my every minute to your happiness and needs. I shall bring you security, safety and joy. . .

You are so smart, Princess. You are driven and motivated to reach your destiny. You are kind, caring and tender, I think. You are so very beautiful that sometimes I think "why me?" Of course I am successful, smart. . . so why not me? Just maybe you sense that something special. . . I hope. )) I know I could make you happy and I have a great feeling and intuition that you could do the same for me.

I admit, I think of you many times the same way your Russian men may think of you. . .

You are so incredibly desirable. You are a true Princess and radiate an aura that outshines the Sun. What man would not want to have you in his life? What man could possibly not want you by his side?

In a perfect world Laura, I want to place my arms around you, feel your heart beating, sense your breath upon my shoulders and feel your incredible touch. . .

Okay. . . I do apologize for maybe being too frank. . . I know you have every right to not answer me in the future, but I felt I had to tell you the whole truth about my feelings. . . Is it love??? Or just desire and loneliness? It probably is all of those factors, but it can be love once we spend time together alone. . . who knows, Princess? A meeting in Kiev for two or three days may end our search forever. . .

I am so impressed with your achievements and experience. I had no idea. This business experience along with your language skills. . . You keep on amazing me!!!!!!!

Your photo on the Black Sea was wonderful. You are so beautiful.

Talk soon. . .

With warm thoughts and affection,

Ludwig

Sweetheart,

You are a very special girl. . . gorgeous, clever, blonde Slavic Princess.

You are so very beautiful Laura, so desirable. . . Your gorgeous eyes, beautiful face, great figure, lovely hands and fingers. . . oh my! I feel as if I am coming out of my skin!!

You have that class. . . and you have character.

I just want to get on an airplane and take you in my arms right away!!!

I just hope that now you feel it is time to receive the comfort and care of an experienced, successful, mature and respectful gentleman who loves family and honors his Lady.

I am so grateful for your kindness. I can say that I dream about you.

I can say that I am truly grateful for you being in my life.

To have your care, support, understanding and willingness to listen. . .

Your words reveal such intelligence and perception.

Your letters are like food for me. . . I so cherish every word and thought you convey.

I am delighted that my feelings have got so deeply into your soul. You are so special Laura.

I think of the day when we are next to each other, I imagine our time together.

The time we shall talk, and walk the streets of Moscow, see the sights and the Russian environment that has made you for me. . .

We will dine at the best restaurants. . . meet your wonderful daughter and friends. . . we'll do whatever we want. . .

You make me feel "Romantic". . .

You are the catalyst for my desire, passion and romantic feelings.

I am sure that being with you will overshadow anything we have ever experienced before.

And I am convinced that your eyes will penetrate my being and cast their warmth to the bottom of my heart. . . that your touch will make the world disappear, as we can only think of each other and the incredible sensations we shall experience.

All will be ours. Everything will be fresh and new. We shall see things for the first time as though we are children, renewed with the gift of Love and care for each other.

In a perfect world, Laura, I want to place my arms around you, feel your heart beating.

You are my magic Princess. You have enchanted me, and are capturing my every attention.

My mind wanders to you during the day. I love the sound of your voice, the tone of your laugh and the energy of your presence.

_I hope to come to your dreams every night, but I really want to fulfill your dreams in everyday life._

Your admirer from USA,  
Ludwig

My Gorgeous Blonde Princess!

My wish for Christmas is to have you wrapped in festive holiday gift paper under my Christmas tree!!! Then I would unwrap you very slowly and open you up like the special present you are. Would I eat you. . . ? Maybe. . . ;-0) Would I cherish you? Certainly. Would I adore you?

YES! Would I love you? Definitely. Would I take care of you and celebrate you as my best lady in the whole world? YES, YES, YES. If we fall in love Laura, my dream is next year that we celebrate Christmas in PARIS together on December 25 and then celebrate New Year's and Orthodox Christmas in Russia. That would be great. . . or maybe, celebrate Christmas somewhere in Rome or New York, New Year's in Paris, and then go to Moscow for Orthodox Christmas. Perfect!

You are so very desirable and beautiful Laura.

With my deep adoration,

Yours, Ludwig

Hi Laura,

Another wonderful letter and more photos! Your daughter will grow up to be a "heart breaker" for she is so lovely. Of course, look at her mother. ;-0)

Darling. . . I beg you, please do NOT ever cut your hair!!!

I LOVE your hair. . . so blonde and so LONG!!!

I appreciate your interest and support, Laura. . . I am impressed you took the time to find out more about me. Darling—I do not even know your last name. I am so stupid. . . )) I hardly know anything about you except that I am so attracted to you and I know that you are probably the woman who will take my heart forever. . . my gorgeous, blonde Lady. . . my Laura.

I only want you to have my Manhood, for I know you will deeply appreciate my care, tenderness, affection, attention and desire for you.

The photos of you. . . . . . . are you trying to kill me?!?!?! You are doing it, Princess. Looking at your photos makes it hard for me to sit still. . . . . . . I just want to get on an airplane, take you in my arms and make mad, passionate love to you.

Your words reveal such intelligence and perception. I am so grateful for your kindness. You do sense me in the truest of light. You are so smart, Princess, and so gentle. To have your care, support, understanding and willingness to listen—you are so very special.

I can say that I dream about you. I can say that I am truly grateful for you being in my life.

I can also state that once we meet in real life, our Fate will most likely be sealed. . .

I wish I could celebrate your birthday with you. It would be the one birthday you would never forget. ;-0)

Our meeting will be a dream come true, Princess, but the "reality" will far exceed our "dream" as everything will come together, once we are together.

I imagine our time together. . . I am sure that being with you will overshadow anything I have ever experienced before. I am convinced that your voice will be a symphony to me, making all music from before seem like noise. . . that your smile will devastate me and make my body weak from joy. . . we will feel we have just woken up from a deep sleep and Life itself has entered our spirits, souls and minds. It will be overwhelming, unimaginable and totally natural at the same time.

I love your photos. I look at them all the time. I imagine being with you and then I go crazy. You are so very beautiful, desirable. . . What is going to happen when we meet???!!!???

With my warmest wishes and romantic thoughts,

Yours, Ludwig

*

Gorgeous Princess,

It was so wonderful to hear your voice and have a chance to speak with you. Your voice is very soothing to me. I can't wait to hear it again in person—especially when you whisper into my ears. . . oh my!!!

_How are you doing today???_ _As for me, this evening my friends and I (most of them are musicians) are having a barbecue in my backyard, and I'm the cook! ))) Then we will go to another area of New York to continue the party._

New York. . . Manhattan is a Disneyland for adults. )) It is the center of the world for Fashion, Banking/Business/Commerce, the Arts, Diplomacy/Statesmanship, and so many other things. It is a magical place, filled with excitement and electricity.

You will feel it immediately when you arrive. ;-)) I know New York would welcome you as its new Princess and embrace you as one of its own. . . if you decide to be with me. . .

Laura. . . I have a feeling. . . How did we live all this time without one another???

I send you my admiration, affection and care,

Ludwig

PS. I am thinking about you. . .»

«Hi Elena! I love Kiev, and I really liked your profile—you seem so genuine. I will add you to Skype. My name is Bradford, but everyone calls me Brad. I have a 7-year-old son, his name is Brandon. I have full custody of him because his mother didn't want him. We live in Florida and if you have any trouble adding me, my email is xxxxxxx@yahoo.com. I also look forward to talking to you soon! I sent you an add request already on Skype.  
Best always to you and yours,  
Brad

Hi Elena,  
I did send you a friends request for Skype. I hope you get it and we can talk soon. Stay warm in Kiev! It is 27 degrees Celsius today, and we should have gone to the beach.  
I look forward to getting to know you.  
With warmth,  
Brad

Dear Svetlana,

It was a real treat to talk to you tonight. I am sorry I had to run off so fast, but my son had T-ball (baseball for kids) practice and I attached some pictures. I must say that after only one Skype I think of you highly. You carry yourself well, have learned English against difficult odds, and have relocated yourself for the sake of you daughter.

Please believe that first impressions mean a lot, and you impressed me. Believe me in saying that I have world-class experience in recognizing what lies within people. When you are on Wall Street and dealing with high net worth individuals and institutions for over 20 years, a man knows every word, expression, tone and articulation of voice means something—we develop a sixth sense. Perhaps that's why I wrote you initially?

I am sorry to hear about your long-term relationship that has gone bad, but I assure you that things will always get better. I have had one long-term relationship in my life, but have had several shorter ones, and I can say each one gets better. I don't know why this is, but I can tell you that there are a lot of good people in the world, and the world is becoming a smaller place.

I will try to Skype you again, and sit in my home office in my shorts and T-shirt :-) even though I can assure you I have racks of suits I try NOT to wear. I live in a small beach town area of 350,000 people and when I leave the house, I dress well. I will try you at 21:00 your time (4 PM my time).

I know things are difficult for you, and for people all over—even here. I contribute to charities for children and for women in need, yet sometimes I feel I do it for my own satisfaction and try to stay anonymous. My life is magic and I am truly blessed.

Since I don't know your address, and cannot send flowers of friendship for International Women's Day, I would still like to help you to get your computer fixed if it is overheating. This is a big problem and you may lose it soon if it is not attended to.

If you were here I would simply take it to be repaired myself, or replace it. I have corporate contacts and I am friends with Michael Dell of Dell Computers—so I get my computer work done pro bono. I hope you accept my very small token of help, and simply pay it forward to someone else in the future, as whether you decide to explore more about me (us), I expect nothing but a smile.

I assure you again that I do this for selfish reasons, as I want to keep communicating with you and hear your feminine voice that reminds me of a Russian fairytale by Pushkin, and presented by the composer Rimsky-Korsakov (illustrated by Ivan Bilibin). I love the arts as a whole, love Broadway shows, opera, and collect fine art.

Ok, I am getting off the subject here. ;-) The subject is that I want to get to know you. I move only as fast as the situation calls for and I know you still need time to heal, so I simply want to date you by Skype until you ask for me to come out and visit. When you ask, I will come and take you out to do whatever you desire. Until then let's laugh, smile and just enjoy each other's company if you wish.

With my sincerest regards for you and your very talented son,

Brad and Brandon, age 7

Dear Elena,

I guess I must be the perfect "horse's ass," since I called you Svetlana earlier (my ex-girlfriend's name) in my first email to you. This might be grounds for shooting me! I guess when we come out of relationships, we are stuck with these subconscious names in our heads. I think we both took our past relationships hard. This may not be easy for you to forgive, but I am truly sorry for the mistake. Maybe you think it was almost as bad as if I cheated on you (which I would never do). Please forgive me, and have a look at the original email that follows with your corrected name. I feel really bad, because I really like you, and feel that you are a kindred spirit. I hope and pray that you can forgive me!

*

Dear Elena,

It's International Men's Day! This is the day when I should be showing you that I am indeed a good man—smart, strong, educated—a man that does not ever want to hurt you or your feelings, and who could be a great friend and partner. . .

I do not feel like a man today! I feel sick to my stomach!

You were so warm and friendly last night, and all excited to talk about how precious your son is and all about his accomplishments; and you were also willing to listen and make a new American friend. Now I know that you and I have things in common—we're both parents, and we both recently left relationships that hit us hard.

I feel like I have let you down, princess.

One more thing I can tell you about myself is that I ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS, but no one is perfect. I know I am not perfect. . . but I try never to make big mistakes like this.

If you were just any woman, I probably wouldn't try so hard to apologize, but you aren't just "any" woman—you are a woman who has my respect, and my intuition says that you are "a real keeper" (as we like to say in the U.S.).

Please, just put me out of my misery, as the only thing I can celebrate today is my own stupidity.

All my best,

Brad

Hello Dear Brad,

You sure know how to make me laugh! Even talking about sad things, you find a way to make it funny. When I read "Dear Svetlana" in your first letter this morning, I thought, "Oops. . . what a pity. . . I really did like that guy. . ."

But reading on, I could see that your letter was meant for me—it was so nice and sincere. About ten years ago I probably would have felt really offended about being called by the wrong name. Fortunately, as we grow older we sometimes also get wiser. (By the way, you are a good psychologist and seem to understand women. . . but you probably know that about yourself, I'm sure.) /smile/

I was thinking of you and your wonderful little boy, Brandon. You know, I fell in love with his red hair at first sight. . . Your son is absolutely adorable and it's impossible not to love him when you see him! I really mean it. When I think about his funny questions last night, it gives me a smile like a sudden ray of sunshine. . . He is a very cute and sweet kid!

I told my son Max about both of you this evening. Like you, I don't keep secrets from my child, and I like to share everything good that's happening in my life with him.

Loved your photos very much, thank you for sending them. . . and thank you very much for all your kind words and sincerity. Your letter touched my heart. I'm impressed by your generosity, your values and your sense of humor, and I really do think we have a lot in common.

Will write to you later and send some pictures of my life. I hope you feel better with your stomach today. . . sorry to hear you weren't feeling well. And of course, Happy Men's Day to you and Brandon!!!!

Bye for now. . .

Warmly and fondly,

Elena

*

Hi again Brad,

I'm sending you some photos from the city where my parents and other relatives live, to give you an idea of what my family is like.

Hope both you and Brandon are having a nice day!

Warmly,  
Elena

*

Elena!

I am so relieved that you've forgiven me, because I really like you! So thank you!

I just tried to Skype you and will try again in a few minutes. . . I love your voice. The way you handled my messed up letter really shows me something about who you are. Forgiveness of small things is so important in any relationship, and even though this wasn't really small in my eyes, you made it look that way.

My warmest regards,

Brad

*

Brad. . . just read your last email. )) I love the way you express your thoughts and emotions. . .  
Go to bed now. . . thinking of you. . .

Lena

Dearest Elena,

I must start out with a joke and then end serious, otherwise you'll think all I do is joke around all the time—that's not me, and in this case, I'm already serious about you. ;-) I have learned a long time ago to take things slow, and if something happens, to just truly appreciate it; and if nothing happens—and I didn't get my hopes up—well, then I would not be too disappointed.

The funny thing was that this morning when I said I was sick, I meant that I was sick from typing the letter to you yesterday with the name of my ex-girlfriend. I was not sick literally, but sick that I could be so excited about meeting you and possibly lose you over a typo. ;-) Now, the sleeping pills the doctors gave me today made me queasy, and tired, but not really sick.

When I realized my typo, I did the only thing a man could do, and you should be receiving flowers today.

I am very tired due to the pill they gave me, and I still have many pictures you sent to download to one file, as they may come in handy one day at a certain type of meeting (the best type!), but I won't explain this yet.

I could say so much, as my heart feels light. . . I read your emails in detail and now I will download every picture you sent. I will say simply this. . .

I met a woman in the place where women normally write to men for the wrong reasons, as do men write women, yet I do not blame them.

You are on this site to better your life and search for love—and you must do what you must do.

I honestly feel that you are here for the right reasons—to find your other half.

What the heck am I talking about here? Let me make it plain and simple. . . OK!

I think you are the most genuine, sincere, intelligent, caring and beautiful woman I have met insofar as I can remember. ;-) I have seen a small slice of your life, and want to know you much better. We have so much in common, and are both single parents with young souls, who both want to "suck the marrow out of the bone of life." (Try to translate that and it merely means that we love life!)

You impress me in so many ways that I can't even begin to tell you! I have dated models with no heart, and women with hearts but no brains; yet you have the combination of all the good qualities and none of the bad. What choice does a man have but to seek to make you his in time (not possessive or controlling). I must say OOPSEY, which is the word my son uses to explain why he just dropped a glass of milk over the whole kitchen or made some terrible mistake. I say OOPSEY, only because I don't really know you yet and I am letting you know what is in my heart, how I feel that in time, we could be each other's better half. All the models in South Beach, Miami cannot even compare to you!

You are one special woman, and I am one special guy for recognizing the tremendous potential we have as a couple. ;-) I really like you, Lena. I pull no punches and tell you direct. If I had to sleep and dream of the perfect woman, she would be you.

I am so proud to have the chance to know a woman like you! I want to write you for the shortest period of time I can, and if I have anything to see into the future with, it's what we may create together. I am so tired now that I can't keep my eyes open, and I still must download your pictures to one file.

The bottom line is, I care for you and your son!

I will write or talk to you soon with more on your emails.

Yours,

Brad and Brandon, 7

*

Princess Elena,

I fell asleep on the warm couch on my porch and it's now 2 AM. I loved the pictures, and I will answer all the questions on the phone before we meet in person. Thank you for the kind emails!

I will discuss them personally with you soon and decide if you get cake or a spanking. ;-)

Your son Max is the cool one. )) Here is another boy with red hair and blue eyes, that asks why the "picture is not moving," or "why you are upside down?"

All my best to a wonderful family.

Brad and Brandon (B&B)

PS. Miss you already!

*

Good morning Brad,

Just a quick note. . . Thank you so much for the flowers!!!

The bouquet is huge! :-)))

Everything is fabulous and yesterday I arranged everything that we planned. . .   
I'll tell you more about it a bit later.  
Last night when I came home there was no Internet, so I thought I would have a rest for a few minutes and then would check the connection again or at least try to text to your mobile if you didn't call me on the phone. Well, it seemed like I had only taken a 15 minute nap, but when I woke up it was already morning! My first thought when I woke up was about you, B&B! /smile/  
For the moment I have to do some work but then I will write you more later today.  
I understand that you are tired of typing, because I also prefer talking as opposed to long letters.  
I'm sending you a photo of my _kiss mark_ on paper. . . /smile/

I wish you a nice day!

With warm regards,  
Lena

PS. The roses are AWESOME. . . I love them!

*

Hi Babe,

The roses are not even close to as beautiful as you are, princess!

_So, you are teasing me with your lips! Laugh!_

_Watch out woman. . ._

_Because some day I will drive you crazy when I nibble on those lips of yours. ;-)_

B&B

*

Ah babe!

I'm going to sleep now for an hour and then I have to work hard, but I'll try to Skype you at around 21:00 tonight. I do want to see you so bad. I am very excited to know whether we will be able to talk and see each other at the same time!!!!

Yours,

Brad

*

Hi Elena,

_Well that attempt at getting an hour's sleep didn't work. . . All I did was close my eyes and see your face. ;-)_

Always,

Brad

Hello from Ukraine,

Thank you for the letters, I do love the way you express yourself. . . definitely. . . I already told you about it, but just want to say it again.  
I know you are a doer, Brad. You are also smart, wise, extraordinary and charismatic. And you have got the mentality of winner, not a loser.  
I feel like looking at you is like looking in the mirror sometimes, because I am just like that as well.  
Your life philosophy is very similar to mine.   
And going back to what you said about models, I can say similar things about some famous guys and millionaires whom I already refused in relationships and marriage proposals,  
though the conditions offered were just amazing. . . I will explain why to you later, if you like. . . but you can probably already guess.  
Talk to you tomorrow. . .   
Please kiss and hug the sunny-haired-boy from me! ))  
Sincerely,  
yours, Lena

*

Dearest Lena,

You are such a tender soul. =) I don't really know you, and you don't really know me, but the one thing I know that will kill anything new and potentially beautiful is distance and time. Distance should be changed to near as fast as it is reasonable, and time shortened to where it is comfortable for both man and woman.

You're very kind to me, and for the acknowledgements as to my character and honor—I thank you. For every positive trait that you recognize in me, I see two in you.

Yes, I have been through the women who only can offer a man their body or their smile, until one day it is gone. Wealthy men also can let power and money go to their head, and they become less of a man for having it, instead of being more of a man for using it wisely—as well as helping people with it. You don't have to explain anything to me about famous people and millionaires, and yes I know what they do, for as soon as I recognize it, I distance myself from them—I know what they have offered you also. I have seen the very best and the very worst in life around me, and it makes me joyous and saddens me at the same time.

I have dreams also. I dream of a life where I can love someone as they love me. When they are gone I miss them and feel half of me is gone also, with both of us only feeling whole when together—even though a certain amount of individual independence is critical to each of their own self-realization. To let my woman know that no matter what happens that I will always be there for her, and for me to know that no matter what happens my woman will always be there for me. I am not a greedy man and need only one good woman—do you know where I could find a woman like this? ;-)

Also, to grow roses as my grandfather did; pick the sweet oranges, tangerines and grapefruits from my own trees again, to see the other half of the world I haven't seen and take my children fishing. . . To have another little boy also, who follows his dreams, and to let them all go the direction in life that makes them happiest. To help them achieve their dreams, but no matter what, to make sure they have fond memories of their childhood and a top grade education.

Glad to hear you got the software straightened out, and you sound as tired as I do. I'll try to Skype you after T-ball in the morning and the art show in the early afternoon. I used to use Skype a lot, but it became bothersome and I only re-installed it last week. Have a wonderful night!

With my warmest, sincerest and most faithful regards,

Brad

Hello Princess!

Thank you so much for being a communicative person, and taking the time to explain things to me! It "shows" your sincere interest in me and my son, and merely does not say it. You are an incredible woman, and every day you amaze me more. I too feel that you and Max are "special." I feel some kind of magic when I see you and talk to you on Skype—I must say it excites me.

Men can have such a problem understanding sometimes. ;-) Yet, if a woman simply has the patience to communicate with the man, he soon learns and things are smooth. ;-) It works the other way also, as men have to communicate with a woman, be understanding, patient and kind with the woman also—and the children.

You have many of the same mannerisms as me, and as you stated, we could be "mirror images" of each other in many ways.

One way we are different, is that I am still living in the corporate world, and have not settled into retirement. In the corporate world business men worry about who is good to do business with, and who is not—who keeps their word and who doesn't. Every day we have to "make things happen," or they never turn into reality.

I sometimes forget that my commitments are of small importance compared to others, and that I am fortunate to not be accountable to a boss in the corporate world any more. I have to relax more and remember that matters of the heart between a man and woman are not a "business transaction," where people are held to their attempt to do something—as things change hour by hour, or even minute by minute for both of us.

I remain very active in the community, with my son, and am finally enjoying the freedom that hard work has provided me. I am the "fixer" to many, and try to spread good to those without hope around my life. Yet, sometimes I take on too much and need to spend more time for me. The few close friends I have, all tell me this, and that is why I have only dated casually for roughly the last 1 1/2 years since I retired. Now I am more interested in dating, and getting to know the woman who will be my other half; my wife, my love, my everything. It is not business, but matters of the heart. I examine too much and think about things too much. Yet, I am starting to adapt and relax more.

I love the pictures of the tangerine tree in your flat, as it reminds me how you see beauty in everything, and I see it also. It makes me remember the ones I could pick from one of the second story decks of the house I lived in while I was married. It symbolizes you also, as it is small and tender, but thrives in an environment that is hard.

_With you, I have met a woman that makes my heart jump out of my body. You are so different and so wonderfully feminine. It makes a man weak at the knees._

It is I that must worry for my heart, as since I met you _I have answered the phone less,_ and feel something different about you compared to every other woman I know. I too enjoy what is starting to develop between us—may it always be true and carry on. Still, I must be the man and hold back a little, but I also have to "make things happen," and not just talk about them like other men do. I have to be the leader, the protector and the provider.

We talked about "bad" famous people, but let me introduce you to one friend of mine who was famous and "good." He was a leader in fitness long before Arnold Schwarzenegger, and at age 96.

Jack used to keep a pocket full of picture postcards of him in his 80s, and he always would sign these for friends and acquaintances—I looked up to him greatly! I attached to this email the one he gave me one day in Tampa in 1994. It merely says " _To my friend Brad. Anything in life is possible, make it happen. . . Jack LaLanne."_ When I first saw what he wrote on the post card I was very surprised, as that is what people said about me all of my life, and what I have attempted to achieve in my life—to make things happen.

I thought it was a "special sign" to me personally, until I saw he wrote these same words on many of the picture post cards he handed out. ;-) Nevertheless, it still is tacked to a corkboard on the wall of my home office.

You may ask why I bring this up.

Lena, I truly wish you were living next door, and I could take you out to dinner, a show or simply walk on the beach with you—yet you are not. Distance and time can take away what has started if I am not the man and "make things happen." Yet, all things take time, and we must make sure we tread water in a sea of uncertainty.

I'll be on Skype a little before 4 PM Princess, and leave my Skype on. If you are not too tired I would love to see you and hear your voice again—it is the voice of an angel. ;-)

I have one appointment on April 1st when I come back from Costa Rica, but can leave on the 2nd, and must be back before the 12th. Please let me know after Tuesday if I'll be able to meet you in your city. ;-)))))

Yours,

Brad and Brandon

PS. You are what all women should be! You don't miss an action, nor one word, a man makes. Perhaps it is because you are such a tender soul and feel so much? Yes, we are very similar.

*

Dearest Elena,

I like to talk to people in the Eastern Bloc, but I can tell you that since I met you there is no one but you. That should scare the hell out of you. ;-)

_I just like you, nothing heavy. . . . . . . yet._

_Something special. . . . . . . . . . . . da._

Good night.

B&B

*

You know, Brad. . . sometimes I feel like I like you far too much. . . after having known each other for such a short time.  
This time when we were talking I felt like I didn't want to let you go. . . which was extremely stupid of me and I realize that. . . /smile/

But forget it. . . I can manage it with myself. . . maybe. = ))  
You are very strong in different meanings. And it has got two sides. . .  
Bye for now  
Elena

Dearest Lena,

I do joke around a lot, and I know you don't understand it, but believe in me telling you that it's very funny and you should laugh! ;-)))))

Now, as to us: I really like you, see something strongly possible and just have to put the time in, along with you, to see if we can truly be each other's better halves (well at least 75% right) as nothing is perfect.

_Welcome to my life Elena, as every time I see you and listen to your voice—I never want to let you go. I already feel you in my life._

I'll admit this man's weakness and say that the only cure for me is to see you soon. ;-)

Yes, I use metaphors and analogies a lot. My family says it's stupid, but they understand it—go figure?

I had a great time Skyping with you tonight and I hope to do it again soon, God willing.

You are one fabulous woman who is like the prettiest flower in the garden. It is only natural that a man should not want to pick it, but sooner or later, he won't be able to resist. ;-)

Yours,

B&B

Hi Lena,

If things go OK in Kiev we will visit Disney World, or the Isle of Atlantis in the Bahamas. I don't want to put any pressure on you, but I'm the man—remember? ;-) I do think of you so very much, I also feel we are each other's better halves, and for you really thinking of me I will always note that you were a wonderfully assertive woman who knew what she wanted. ;-)

Yours,

Brad

*

My Dearest Elena,

I am worried that I will come to Kiev and never want to leave. I want to hold you close and say nothing. To feel your heart beat, your breath and to smell your hair as I hold you close. I miss you when away from Skype also, _and if you do not watch out I will make you my woman. ;-)_ You are a very good person, and kind to me. I like your sense of humor and have fun with you!

Yours,

Brad

Hi Lena. . . Princess. . .

I didn't really have much to say today, but I just wanted to write you something small and tell you I care about you and Max. . . and I miss you— _I've been thinking about you, as you pop in and out of my head over the course of the day._

I was on my cell phone with my travel agent today. We are talking about the big surfing trip to Costa Rica March 15th to the 31st, and I wanted to pay them for the trip to Kiev as I was on the line. I know you can't tell me anything until your boss gets back, yet I'm dying to book it. ;-)

I have to leave soon as Brandon will be home from school, and I must meet my friend Brian to pick up the VIP tickets for tomorrow night's close of the Naples Fine Art and Antique Show. I also have to stop at Vitamin World to pick up some powdered egg protein for protein shakes before and after workouts

It will be nice to meet you and hold your hand while we talk. _To maybe sit down under a tree just saying nothing would be ok, as long as my arms are around you. ;-) We could watch the world go by._

I really think it will be an eye opening experience for both of us and I look forward to returning to Kiev—mostly to see you. ;-) Please see what great places you'd like to go out to while we're there also.

I can fly out on the 2nd, but don't know if I can stay as long as the 12th—as I do need to come home. Brandon will be staying with his biological mother and the baby sitter I trust so much, and I will be gone far too long away from him.

Have a wonderful day princess!

Yours, Brad

*

Hello from cold but sunshiny Ukraine. . .

How are B&B doing??

Read your letters. . . thank you for the kind and beautiful words.

Hope at least not all of them are taken from your favorite book. ))

I've been busy with work and Max these last few days, so could not reply earlier. . .

feeling a bit guilty about it.

Will write you more today later.

Thinking of you a lot. . .

Yours,

Elena

*

Hi Princess,

I have been out of town and I am at the equivalent of the internet cafés of Kiev, on a rented computer at a store. I will return tonight, and it was great hearing your voice. I so much looked forward to hearing your voice today.

_Honey, my words are true and not out of the book. I only use the book when I run into something I have not experienced before, such as meeting a wonderful woman and her son in the Ukraine. ;-)_

I have to run, but will you email me and let me know a time we can talk?

Always yours,

Brad

*

Brad, hi. . .

I probably already owe you and your little boy some of the extra time you've added to my life, as they say laughs and joy are making people live a lot longer! :-)

I know that some of your jokes are not easy for me to understand (mostly because the phone line is sometimes not clear enough to understand one hundred percent of what was said), but some of your and Brandon's phrases are really perfect masterpieces! :-))

Even when you aren't trying to say anything funny, it seems that way for me because it's like we are thinking the same thoughts and doing the same things. . . then I can't believe my eyes and ears. . . and how could it be?

For example, you wrote in one of your previous letters: "I use metaphors and analogies a lot. My family says it's stupid, but they understand it."

That made me laugh like crazy, because what you said about yourself was ALL the same as what I can say about myself. Isn't that incredible?!

How can we be so similar?? ))

That's pretty dangerous, to be mirrors of each other. . . a human is selfish by his/her basic, natural instincts and loves to look into the mirror so much. ;-)

When you said we could just be friends, I thought, "Oh. . . I would like to see how we would manage to do that!" Because, in some way, for me you are like a very strong magnet. . . in the same way as I am a "magnet" for you! Try to keep two magnets really close to each other and to resist doing what both of them want to do—sooner or later you have to give in to the power.

But there can be exceptions from any rule, especially with exceptional people. . . so we could try at least. . . and I will do my best. =))

Should be on Skype tomorrow night. . . I think.

Hope you got home fine last night. . . your voice was very kind and tender yesterday. ))

Warmly,

Yours, Lena

*

Hi Princess,

You are too kind! I think you misunderstood me, as I am not looking to be just friends—even though being best friends is so important.

I am still not home. I hope to return late tonight—well in time for Friday's Skype call. Did you find out anything on free dates from April 2nd (April 3rd by the time I get there) to 11th (the day I must return to be back for the 12th)?

I know I laugh and joke around at life, yet I can be serious too. It is hard to tell a joke when others cannot see the face of the one making the joke. ;-)

I will try to make this clear. I'm looking for my best friend; my partner in life, my wife, the mother to our children, the one person in life who knows I will always be there for them as I know they will always be there for me. The person that makes me hurt in my heart when they are away, and they hurt when away from me. The woman I CAN'T stop making the most passionate love to every chance we get also. ;-))))))). . . This should be easy as I already think of you daily.

We are so very similar, have the same beliefs in life, morals, and attitude. Should I just ask you if you're my other half and you say yes? Maybe in Kiev, and face to face you can tell me, and I can tell you the same. ;-) We must meet! I was simply exhausted and could not drive safely as I am exhausted again today, but must go home.

 Always yours

Brad

PS. Have a wonderful night and day tomorrow!

*

Hi Babe,

You make me smile with your emails, even though my eyes are bleeding and I am so tired of driving. I put almost 2000 kilometers on my car in the last week! I am finally home, and tomorrow I will pay bills, open mail, and schedule things—but tonight I sleep.

Your emails are always so feminine and intimate. _They make me feel like more of a man—even though I am "one hell of a man" already! ;-)_ But, I will let you make your own mind up about me in Kiev.

I don't know how many days we have together, but we will meet in person. I know many Americans say they will come, but they don't. You know _my "word is my bond" and I will come. I am the only middle class American crazy enough to travel 13,000 kilometers to meet someone for the first time, yet how can I resist your charm as it makes us into two magnets? ;-)_

I have little to offer you as I am not a "famous person" anymore, or a "rock star," but I am emotionally, physically, and financially stable. Yes, it is true—I am an incredible lover. ;-)))

But, this is NOT a joke as "I allow no woman in my bed unless she is in my heart and in my head." I do not see who I can sleep with for "sport." I also will never harm you or the children, and cherish your opinion as your other half. I do not need a maid or a cook, as I already have one—but the other half of me is missing. ;-)

If you are my true other half, then I will love you and make you feel more special than you have ever felt (without losing my masculinity) and I will seek a relationship with you that lasts forever. I will always be faithful and never force you to do anything you don't want to do. I will treat or adopt Max as my own, and love him just as much as I love Brandon. I will not give you a life of extreme riches and luxury, as I am middle class now, but we will never want for anything and we will have all we need—as the rest is just for showing off.

I'm going to take pictures of my house this weekend and email you many. Again, I am tired after four days of little sleep, but I feel I did good.

Elena, I made $6M US from 1984 to 2001. Yet, I was never happy. Life is not about money, but never wanting and always realizing what is important. I'm sorry I talk so much about money, but I want you to know I am middle class, do not have a million dollar home (only $400,000), but if I choose to give up the "rat race" and "spinning on the wheel" for love, it is only because it is true freedom. I have a home, and not just a simple house. I also answer to nobody—but in time, my wife and children, as I am more clever and have more strength than anyone you have ever met. . . wow, that sounds humble, huh? I have nothing less to prove.

Now, I am getting too heavy and not funny, as life is about fun and taking life with humor. We must never forget that there are unfortunate people who do not have stability, security and true love.

Now this was not funny, but it was the TRUTH, and I live a very good life with all that it provides. Are you sure we're magnets? ;-)))) I guess Kiev will tell.

I will only be available on Skype from 21:00 to 22:00 Friday, as I have not spent time with my son for four days, and I'm getting ready for two weeks in Costa Rica and then Kiev. I want to spend this week with him as much as possible!

Yours,

Brad and Brandon

*

Hello Brad,

Yes, I think I should be able to Skype around 9 PM. . . looking forward to seeing you tonight. ))

Got the dates from my boss finally. . . if it is possible, can we meet after April 6th???

Sending you some more photos of mine.

With warm thoughts,

Lena

*

Hello again,

Want to add something.

Speaking about explanations, I had to state you were very patient with me explaining that what you want from me is not just a friendship. )) Brad, I never ever did misunderstand you on that matter though.

I wrote you things about friendship only because those were my thoughts and feelings after you said that if it didn't work between you and me, we could stay friends at least.

I could tell you more about why I feel such an option was hardly possible, but that would probably scare you. . . I should remember you are still just a man. ))

I remember in one of your letters you mentioned things that may scare me, in your opinion. . . which wouldn't, in fact. Yes, I am still a human and psychological things may work with me. . . but, like you, I can see more than most other people can. I also analyze what and why things happen, and always make my own conclusions.

So many times in my life I've heard from other people how fearless I am. . . which is absolute nonsense, of course. . . stupid to be absolutely fearless, and I am not.

Well, now I am gone into something heavy. ))

I really like you and you are special for me, B@B

Warmly,

Elena

*

Yes, I will try to book tickets for April 6th to the 11th as I have to be back the 13th and will be flying the 12th. Or do you want to see me the 6th and I fly out the 5th? I will Skype with you and talk more about it.

Yours,

Brad

PS. I'll write you more later, as I got in late and have had little sleep.

*

Brad, how can you see me on the 6th and fly back on the 5th?? ))

By the way. . . since our first talk on Skype and on the phone, today was the first time I have visited the dating site. My profile is unavailable for men to see any more. I did it only because I wanted to. You do not have to do same, of course.

And I was curious to find and to read what you said in your profile. . .

Hmm. . . it is probably embarrassing for me to let you know that I didn't see your profile before today. . . I say this because I like to. As I told you, I only visited that site a couple of times earlier as I'm not fond of things like that. Also, I've been busy with different things in my life.

But what you put there did impress me, and it was a great pleasure to read.

And it made me feel this weird "mirror effect" in our attitudes one more time. . .

Most of what you have said in your profile is what I say about myself also.

Talk to you later, my "mirror" from Florida.

Warmly,

Lena

*

Hi Princess,

I will buy my ticket on Monday and look to arrive Thursday April 7th, and leave Monday April 11th or 12th. I don't want to push my return trip back, as I have a 1 PM dental visit on the 13th, and since the government is picking up the tab—I can't miss these appointments. I have attached a link to the different hotels in Kiev, and I always stay at nice hotels. Can you click on the link and give me the names of the hotels near you? I don't want to stay far away from you, as it makes no sense. ;-)

I could tell that you were tired. I was also tired tonight, after this week. I do feel an intense connection with you, and feel we could have something great. I am starting to care very much for you, but just need to know how you feel. . . and how I feel when we meet. I am only being cautious, and if I am going to be the man of this household, I must always "sort things out" for us. ;-)

You are so incredibly beautiful on the inside and the outside also—a true little Ukrainian princess. I look at you and just want to pick you up in my arms and carry you to our bed. To hold you tight and sleep with you in my arms, and never let go of you!

_I think it is I that should be careful that you don't make me your man, before I can make you my woman. ;-0_

Have a great night!

Yours,

Brad

*

Hello Lena,

I went to the dating site and found your pictures to download. This is a sad time for me, as one friend just lost their father, and another is having problems with their job. It is interesting to see how other people live, but I will let my membership expire and that will be it—but at least I made some friends around the world.

_The only woman I write to is you, though! BELIEVE IT!_

Always,

Brad

*

Hi Lena,

I sent you some pictures of my house. It is only a small fraction of the house, but I am not very good with cameras. I hope this will give you an idea.

Always,

Brad

*

Ha ha. . .  
Brad, how can you manage to be SO SPECIAL IN EVERYTHING YOU DO???!!  
Nobody else in my life has sent me pictures of their house all in 1-second long videos! =))))  
Thank you very much, very nice.  
Warm regards,  
Lena

*

Hi Lena,

I really don't know what I'm doing and just sent what I could. I didn't show you the other three bedrooms and other areas, as it was just too much. My house is humble, but I will soon move into another one anyway. I hope all is OK with you and you have a nice day.

Sincerely yours,

B&B

*

Hello Brad,  
It's OK, please don't worry about the pictures.   
They give me a general idea, and my curiosity is satisfied.  
You are doing great in huge amounts with other things instead.  
No one can know everything. As for me, for example, I don't understand anything at all about the stock market. . . which is a big pity, and I am embarrassed to confess it. . . just never had an opportunity to deal in it.  
So we are very similar, but still very different in other things—and it is still fabulous. . . in my opinion. ))  
Have a nice day too.  
Warmly,  
Lena

*

Hello Princess!

That was so nice of you to call me today! You really got me at my weakest moment, as I was just about to get up. Your voice and my bed all at once are just too much for a man to handle! ;-)

I must pick my friend John up at noon from dropping off his car to be washed and take him home. Brandon's T-ball game will be soon after at 1:30. I will not be home until past 10 PM your time.

I wanted to tell you what I feel our first date will be like. . .

I know that I will be sitting somewhere, perhaps a little café, and I'll be waiting for you. . .

I'll be looking around all over and then finally see you next to me!

I'll hug you and lift you up in the air so high that I sweep you off your feet with my hug. I'll gently set you down and look into your eyes for a moment, and then I'll pull a nearby chair out for you to sit down.

We'll take our time and drink a fine glass of wine or two, and have a wonderful lunch. Then we'll leave and look at the store windows as we talk. We'll laugh and draw closer to each other, and if we pass a little alleyway, I'll divert us to sneak a first small kiss from my princess—holding my lips against yours forever.

We'll find some shade from the sun and sit down under a tree, watching everyone come and go, but thinking only of this wonderful moment. Now things could get a lot hotter from there, but I have to leave a little bit for imagination and a second date. . . don't you think?? ;-)

Have a great day, princess!

Yours,

Brad

*

Hello Brad,

Thank you for describing our future first date. . .

As for me, whatever happens is supposed to be spontaneous.

It is better to plan some romantic arrangements only as an approximate draft, because feelings or passion cannot be fulfilled by schedules.

Otherwise "magic" disappears. . . together with interest. . .

What I really like in our communications, is that we can discuss different subjects about life.

As for our _lust_ talk, your analogies are really funny.

So you imagine yourself as a tiger, and me as only a deer?!! :-)

What is going to happen when a tiger and deer meet then?

The tiger would just hunt "Bambi," and have her for his breakfast. . . and probably for lunch and dinner too!! ))

Warm regards,

Lena

*

Dear Lena,

That was only one possible scenario of our first date, there are many more that carry over for days and the date never ends—but I didn't want to scare you! ;-)

Yes, I love spontaneity too, we must PLAN to have lots of spontaneous events in our life, OK??

We will play things "by ear" as I do not want the "magic" to disappear along with interest.

_Regarding our LUST talk (I think you meant to spell it "LAST talk," or was your mind somewhere else? ;-))))))) Either way, it's "all good" with me! ;-) It can be last talk or lust talk!!! ;-)))_

Yes, I use stupid analogies and metaphors, but sometimes they make sense. For example, sometimes in life "you eat the bear, and other times the bear eats you." Now about your tiger and the deer analogy. . .

I think we are both tigers, as I see this side in you. Yet, when you feel comfortable with a man, you can also play the role of the deer—so feminine, soft and vulnerable.

Maybe if we are both tigers at times, we'll share who devours who for breakfast, lunch and dinner? ;-)

With warmth in my heart for you and Max,

Brad

PS. Why is it so hard for women to tell a man they like them, or are crazy about them?

*

But why are men are so impatient and want everything from women all at once?! ;-)

Lena

PS. About the _last/lust_ thing, it was only a MISPRINT. When I found out and checked in the dictionary for the meaning of the other word, I was laughing like crazy!!! I just didn't know the meaning of that word until now.

*

Hi Babe,

I just got up to check my email and will go back to bed after some chicken soup and juice.

I was asleep when you called and must leave my cell phone on as Brandon is away.

But, if I talk for a couple of minutes, I cannot get back to sleep. I am sorry I rushed you, but I have less than two days to get well here before my trip Tuesday.

I will try to set something up with you tomorrow night if you're free. If I do not get well before the trip, I will not get well in some little village, and if I get worse on the trip I will ruin the whole trip for everyone. I'm sorry babe, but I just got sick yesterday, and was hoping to kill it with sleep, nutrition and sitting in the steam room.

Miss you and I think the misprint was very funny also. I laughed hard. It is now 1 AM your time, and if you were awake I would try to Skype with you, but I feel terrible, and will finish my emails and go to bed again.

Always yours,

Brad

*

Hello Brad,  
It is 3 AM here but I cannot sleep because of some thoughts I was having about your news. . . When you said you got the flu before the trip, it reminded me of a situation when I badly burned my hand packing for a Crimean Black Sea journey a couple of years ago. . . and the trip was terrible. It seemed like my burned hand was a sign I didn't pay enough attention to prevent this from happening. . . This thought came to me right after talking to you this evening, but I was trying to persuade myself it is nonsense. . . and anyway, you probably wouldn't think of this as an analogy.  
So to change the subject in my head, I decided to watch TV for a while before bed. . . and the program was about things going on in Japan. . . and finally the forecast about possible earthquakes and tornadoes around California. . . and that made me feel worried even more!  
I cannot call to talk about it because you might be sleeping. Maybe I am just worrying for nothing. I would be happy if that was so. You know, I was wondering if I should tell you about what I feel or not. . . you might think I'm stupid, but please listen to what your sixth sense says about these kinds of things.  
Now I will try to get some sleep before it's time to get up.  
Wishing you to feel better very soon.  
Sincerely,  
Lena

Dearest Elena,

Men do not want everything at once, princess, they just want to know they are the woman's favorite. If both man and woman do not show and tell each other their feelings, they will never be able to let the other person know through their words and actions.

I hope you understand that being "crazy" about another person merely means they like that person—and there are different degrees of crazy.

I know you like me, and are a little bit "crazy" about me (just an expression).

The reason I know you are a little crazy is the attention you give me. A woman who did not like a man at all would give him no attention. A woman who can keep up with me, and try to let the man know through her actions that he is a favorite, or maybe even THE favorite, shows him she is a little crazy for him (likes him).

I ask you to NEVER change, as this is what overcomes distance, and we are far apart for now. Then, to see you worried about me, and then emailed and Skyped with me tonight (your morning) really shows care for me!!!! This makes me only think of you.

When you look at relationships, even new ones, there is this care by both man and woman from the very start. If it grows to where we simply can't be without one another, then we will make it happen together.

I thank you for your thoughtfulness, and also want you to know that for what attention you give to me, it will always be matched by me!!!

Yours truly,

Brad

PS. You really impress me! Emails are never as good as in person or on Skype. We all say things and then read it back saying to ourselves "did I really write this?"

*

Hello Brad,

Yes, of course, I do know for sure what it means to be "crazy about somebody."

As for me, it is quite a lot more than just simply liking somebody. . . you may like some nice bird sitting on the tree, but I think it does not necessarily mean you are crazy about that bird. ))

I agree that the right words in the relationship means a lot. I think though, that the problem in the world is that there are too many fake ones. That's why I prefer to trust one's actions more than words. . . and probably to express my feelings with actions, especially in the beginning of the relationship.

Also it is easy, really, to tell about feelings, and even whether you do not have any.

But if you do, it probably takes some time. . . because you have to make sure that it's real.

Today I am feeling a little bit like I am in a trance because I almost didn't have any sleep last night. . . or is it because last night you hypnotized me, looking like that. . . you know, like a python hypnotizing a rabbit? I've had this feeling with you before also. . . I said you were a dangerous man! ))

Glad to know you are feeling better now. : -)) And was glad to see your little cute son running into the door of your house. . . (and his sitter greeting me and smiling behind your back.)

Speaking about my care and attention to you. . . I am probably just being selfish. . . Once you have met somebody both attractive and special, you still want to have this in your life. ))

And why I was looking at you like that?? Maybe I wanted to remember your face for the future, when you will enjoy your holidays and won't be able to be on Skype.

I told my son Max you are going surfing and he said: "WOW!!!" He is another person I know who is crazy about different water activities. =))

Wishing you a nice day, and happy packing. . .

Thinking of you always. . .

Yours,

Elena»
