Ch 1.

(Journal entry)

9 · 5 · 2010

The day before the first day of Senior Year.

Senior year finally.

10 more months until high school is officially over and me and Ish can plan our future.

That's all I could think about.

So much dram has happened in the last 3 yrs of high school.

People still can't get over the fact that we're different.

Well I guess that's to be expected. People wont just change out of nowhere. Its just like how people cant get over the fact that someone's gay or if they have a different religion.

It doesn't really matter to me anymore, but it would be nice for people to just to get over it.

Oh well.

Yours truly,

Cythanie Estral. [Soon to be Gray.]

I closed my journal and put it in my nightstand where I keep all my valuable possessions under lock. I laid my head down on my soft feathered pillow thinking about my life.

My full names Cythanie Hope Estral

I'm 17 turning 18 next May.

Senior in high school.

Boyfriend, Ish Gray [see GRAY! Were secretly engaged only us and our click know.] He is 17 also and a senior.

I belong to the smallest click in school.

The Scene Kidz. [ **Scene kids** go out of their way to appear to be adorable. They show how adorable they are by worshipping Hello Kitty, making obscure references to ninjas, and roaring at people for no obvious reason...RAWR. **Scene kids** also have a dictionary that the majority of people do not have access to. They can be quite difficult to understand at times, but usually you can work out what information they are trying to convey by sounding out the word to recognize them phonetically. Example: A lot of **scene** spelling consists of adding another letter to whatever letter in a specific word has the longest sound. Other scene lingo includes "rad", "Ace", "stellar" "Oh-em-gee", "RAWWR", or "Kayyy". A typical scene kid has black hair or some crazy colors, crazy streaks with flowing bangs covering his/her eye or both. Scene kids' hair is dead straight, sometimes poofy-spiked at the back. They wear classic shoes like Converse or Vans Classics.]

There are six of us.

Me 17 [senior, name pronounced SIN-the-KNEE]

Ish 17 [senior]

Nikolette 17 [junior, name pronounced NICK-o-LET, dating Nyklus]

Nyklus 17 [senior, name pronounced NICK-lus]

Toshya 16 [junior, name pronounced TASHA, dating Shaayne.]

Shaayne 16 [junior, name pronounced SHANE]

We all have multi-colored hair so I cant give descriptions. (A/n: I'll upload pics so you could see what I mean kay?)

I'm 5'2", that's pretty short for a 17 yr old I know but oh well. My wardrobe consist of colorful skinny jeans, colorful super skinny jeans, band tees, colorful wife beaters, vanz, , converse's, vest cardigans, ripped off jean shorts [some distorted], graphic tees, neon colored nail polishes, eyeliners, tongue ring, belly button ring, & double ear piercing.

Ish is 6'0", we're a weird couple I know but we love each other to death. He mainly wears, sagging skinny jeans, v-necks, beanies, vanz, band tees, & a tongue ring. He has a tattoo over his heart that says my name. Yeah I OWNz him! He and the rest of the guys are strong and the have a 6-pack.

Nikolette is 5'3" [all the girls in our group are short. We don't know why...] she dresses like me except for the vest cardigans, and tongue ring.

Nyklus is 5'11" wears the same type of clothing as Ish and he has a tattoo over his heart that says Nikolette.

Toshya is 5'2". She wears the same type of clothing as me and she has a nose ring.

Shaayne is 6'0" dresses like the other guys and he has a tattoo over his heart that says Toshya.

We girls are really crazy and we like disturbing the piece. You couldn't ever catch the boys without their skateboards. That's all they do. One time Ish picked me up for our date on a skateboard. That didn't work out so well...

Surprisingly we girls are more flexible than the cheerleaders. One day in Phys Ed we had to do tumbling. The cheerleading coach asked us to try out for the squad. We did and we actually made it but we told them 'no thanks' and walked out. We told the guys and we were all in a laughing fit! That made the boys try out for the football team. They made it and did the same thing we did. That's another reason why the cheerleaders and jocks don't like us.

I fell asleep reminiscing on my high school journey. We came so far.

Nyklus Pov

First day of senior year.

I never thought that it would come this quickly.

I got dressed slowly that morning not needing to rush to get to school; I pulled on a pair of bright black skinny leg jeans, with a chain going from one side of my hip to the other and a red shirt with a large skull logo.

I was excited to see Nikolette today at school, fine I didn't have any classes with her because she is in a younger year, but that didn't stop us from sitting together at lunch. Each lunch we would sit in the same spot, underneath a tree over looking the sports field.

Walking into my bathroom I styled my hair in its usual way. My black hair falling over my left eye. I smiled at my reflection, my snakebites glistening in the light.

I was now ready for my first day of school. Running out of my bedroom I grabbed my bag and my skateboard and galloped out the front door.

I rode it just to the end of the street, where Ish lived. I waited out the front of his house for maybe five minutes, when he came bounding out the front door, with skateboard in hand.

A smile playing on his lips as he jumped on his skateboard and rode next to me.

'How is Cythanie?' I asked.

'Not too bad, she is excited to be a senior this year.' Ish and Cythanie are engaged, only our click knows. They are pretty much inseparable.

'Seriously who isn't excited?' I laughed.

'True... true.' He laughed with me. We were getting close to school now; we could see all the fancy cars pull into the student car park. I could see my beautiful Nikolette standing with the rest of the group; a large smile grew on my face.

I jumped off my skateboard and ran over to her, throwing my arms around her to pull Nikolette into a hug. I had missed her so much, even though it was only one night.

'It's good to see you to.' She giggled and returned my hug.

'Hey man.' Shaayne smiled over at me. I nodded a reply and draped my arm over Nikolette's shoulder.

We all walked into the school together, the new juniors stared as we walked past them. None of them knowing what to think about us, not that we cared. We don't care what anyone thinks of us except for us, we like being different. Standing out in the crowed is what we do best.

The homeroom bell sounded down the hallway. I turned to Nikolette and gave her a quick peck on the cheek.

'I will see you at lunch.' I smiled down at her.

She smiled and nodded. Nikolette grabbed Toshya's hand and pulled her to homeroom, Shaayne followed behind.

While I walked to homeroom with Ish and Cythanie.

I had always hated homeroom, ever since I had started at this school. That was mainly because of Mark and his goons. They had always given me and Ish trouble and lately my temper is running short with him. Fingers crossed that he won't provoke me.

'Look here boys... our lovely little Nyklus.' Mark bellowed out to the class.

I sighed and sat in my seat... it's just for fifteen minutes that's all it is fifteen minutes...

I may look like a scrawny guy, but little does Mark know I was hiding some muscle. Fine it wasn't as big as most footballers, but I did have enough to take one on.

'Just ignore them man.' Ish leant over my desk and took control of my attention.

'Easily said then done.' I sighed and gained control of my emotions.

'Better.' He laughed and moved back over to his desk.

'Yeah.' I looked up from my desk to answer my name.

Lunch couldn't have come any sooner... I was missing Nikolette and I really needed a break from classes. I just couldn't wait till school was over for the year.

We sat in our usual spot and relaxed. The only group of our kind in this school and nobody could change anything about it.

Nikolette lay back on my shoulder as we talked about the future.

Cythanie Pov

Towards the end of lunch I excused my self to the restroom.

Once I finished my business I checked my make up in the mirror.

Walking out the restrooms I realized I needed, for some strange reason, hip-shaking music.

I walked to my locker to retrieve my I-pod. While I'm at it I might as well get my textbooks that I needed for my next class. I listened to Nicki Minaj's Massive Attack while I got my stuff out. Now this is hip-shaking music.

'Well, well, well. What do we have here? Cythanie Estral. It's a shame you hang out with those freaks. I'd totally tap _that._ ' Mark the football captain [hurl] said. Ew he's talking to me I think I'm going to PUKE!

'Well that's just too d*mn bad, isn't it?' I smirked walking away. But apparently he wasn't done talking to me because he slammed me into the lockers. Ouch!

'Look here you little slut,' Slut? I'm no slut! I've only slept with Ish. I only sleep with Ish! 'I didn't excuse you! Nobody walks away from me!'

'I believe _I_ just did.' I smirked.

'You better watch that smart little mouth of yours.'

'Or what.' I challenged.

'I'll have to take you right here in this hallway. I bet you like it rough and you're a screamer.' In my peripheral vision I saw Ish and the gang walking up to us.

'You're right. She is a screamer.' Ish smirked. 'Take your hands off my girlfriend.'

Mark backed of but didn't leave. 'Aw look if it isn't pretty little _Ishmael Gray_ protecting his girlfriend.

'HEY! I'm the only one who can call him pretty!' I exclaimed.

'And I'm anything but little.' Ish said. I nodded my head vigorously. He's HUGE!

Nikolette and Toshya pulled me away from the bickering guys to the restroom. They inspected my back.

'D*MN Cythanie he fucked up your back. It's all purple and blue.' Toshya said.

'Ish is gonna kill Mark... well I guess the world would be a better place.' Nikolette added. We walked out the restrooms only to find Ish beating the crap out of Mark. Shaayne and Nyklus were trying to pull him off.

'Ish! Ish baby STOP!' I yelled. Reluctantly he stopped and walked over to me holding me close.

'This isn't over FREAKS!' Mark declared limping away.

Ish started rubbing my back and he felt me wince. 'Let me see your back Cythanie!' He asked furious. I had no choice. An angry Ish is scary...

I showed him and he ran down the hall after Mark. 'A**HOLE!!!' He exclaimed. The boys had to run after him. I sat down my back against the lockers and pulled my knees up. I rested my elbows on my knees and put my head in my hands. We waited until the gut dragged Ish back. I'm serious they actually dragged him kicking and cursing.

When he finally calmed down he walked up to me and pulled me into his arms. We all just waited in the hall way until the bell rang telling us to go to our next classes.

Me and Ish had calculus and Nyklus had geography. We all went our separate ways.

Nikolette Pov

It's a good thing me, Tosh', and Shaayne had all the same classes. We wont have to deal with all the haters alone. It would be nice to have me and Nyklus in the same classes also, but I guess god did it for a reason? It's going to be horrible not have them here next year.

I'm going to be bawling like a baby at their graduation.

I'll probably hang on to their legs when they leave for college. I know they said that they're going to Toronto University and its just a hour and a half away but it wont be the same. I'll have to go through a whole school year without my baby. At least Toshya has Shaayne. I'll be all alone in a school full of lovers.

I wonder if they'll let me graduate a year early. I have good enough grades... my mom did it. I'll talk to Nyklus about it later tonight while he's over my house.

Ish Pov

I cant believe that jerk touched my fiancée! If it weren't for Cythanie and they guys I'd probably be in jail for murder. No one can manhandle my Cythanie but me!

Ugh I cant be here anymore!! This teacher is driving crazy. She keeps talking about improper fractions and mixed numbers! Is she mentally challenged? This is calculus not 3rd grade math. And to top it off the lady is BLIND! Not really but she needs glasses. Everyone isn't paying attention and they are fooling around.

I need some Cythanie time. We need to get out of here.

Text message to Cythanie,

From Ish:

'Babe lets get outta here and go back to my place. My parents won't be back til tomorrow afternoon.'

Cythanie Pov

I got a text message from Ish asking me to go back to his house. well it is the last period of school and our teacher wont notice, I guess we can leave.

I nod my head and gathered my stuff.

We walked out the room and nobody noticed. I forwarded a text message to Nyklus, Nikolette, Toshya, and Shaayne telling them that me and Ish were leaving early.

Everyone sent a text back saying 'have fun' and a winking emotion icon.

Well shit...

Scene Kidz Chapter 4

Cythanie's Pov

Ish walked beside me toward his house, his skateboard in one hand and mine in the other.

We were silent for a while not talking, not wanting to break the silence. After a while I could no longer take it.

'How is your back?' Ish beat me to starting a conversation.

'I will be fine.' I sighed and winced at the thought of being pushed into my school locker one more time.

'That p***k should pay for what he did to you.' Ish grumbled looking down at the ground.

'Ish... sweetie come on. You were luck not to get caught bashing the hell out of him before, don't do it again okay. He isn't worth it.' I stopped walking in my tracks, pulling Ish into my arms.

'Promise me you won't do anything stupid.' I whispered into his muscular chest.

'Cythanie... he can't treat you like that.'

'I don't care... promise me.' I pulled away from him to look him directly in the eyes.

'Fine I promise not to go after Mark.' He rolled his eyes and pulled me back into his arms, where I remained for what seemed a lifetime but was only like five minutes.

'Thank you.' I whispered and pulled him closer. After another few moments' silence we began continued to walk back to Ish's house.

Ish's parents weren't at home today... to come to think of it they were rarely at home... I think it's because they are more worried about their work and stuff like that, which means they are constantly out of town.

Ish led me into his bedroom. It was a large room with silvery gray walls, red lockers for a wardrobe off to the left, a large black and white bed and a dark brown ladder off to the right. I loved his room ever since the first day that I stepped in his house.

I smiled softly and placed my bag at the end of the bed, while Ish wrapped his arms around my waist holding me there.

Giggling softly I turned in his arms I placed my hand over his heart where my name had been tattooed.

'I love you.' I whispered softly and kissed him passionately on the lips.

Nyklus Pov

I was worried about Ish. I haven't seen him lose control like that before; fine he had very right to punch the sit out of Mark for touching Cythanie. But I was worried that he would try and do something stupid, to try and get revenge.

I would do the same if I was put in that position, which I hope never, happens because I don't want my beautiful Nikolette getting hurt.

I sighed and finished off my schoolwork for the day and packed up my things... it was going to be a long afternoon. Pushing my things into my bag I walked out the classroom door.

I was excited to see my Nikolette... my beautiful Nikolette.

Nikolette was about 5'3" and she had bleach blond hair on the top and black hair underneath, which was always styled in the same way everyday, she has ice blue eyes that can see into your soul, they were always emphasized with black eyeliner and eye shadow and Her skin was flawless.

She was like an Angel sent from Heaven just for me.

I waited for Nikolette in the same spot as I usually did, every afternoon I would walk her home. To make sure that she would make it home all right and the other truth was I like spending time with her.

Nikolette came bounding down the front school steps and over to me, where she wrapped her arms around me and held me for a moment.

'I missed you.' Nikolette smiled as she pulled away.

'I missed you to.' I chuckled softly and grasped her hand softly, while leading her away down the street.

'How was class?' I smiled and shifted my skateboard in my hand.

'Boring...' she giggled and looked over her shoulder, to see some other kids walking home. 'It would have been better if you were with me.' Nikolette continued to giggle.

'I'm sure both of us would be happy if we were in the same class.' I lent over and kissed her cheek.

Nikolette's home was just a couple blocks from the school, so she didn't need to catch the bas and she didn't need to drive. Every day she would walk to school with Toshya, Shaayne and Cythanie, seems they all live so close together. However Ish and I lived further away then the others, but we didn't mind because that gave us an excuse to ride our skateboards to and from school.

Yeah if you haven't noticed we love our skateboards... I think Cythanie told me once that Ish actually showed up on date with his skateboard. I'm not sure if it turned out too good, but I'm sure they had fun.

Nikolette's house was a large tanned building with glass, with trees off to the side to add privacy to the house. It was very spacious and very nice, inside and out.

'I will see you tomorrow.' I bent down and kissed her softly on the lips. Nikolette's father didn't really like me, but he didn't really hate me either. We would get along fine if in a group of people, but with just me, him and Nikolette it wouldn't end too pretty.

'Missing you already.' She giggled and kissed me again.

'I have to go.' I said remembering I had work and kissing Nikolette again.

'You should go then.' She giggled once more and kissed me.

'Yeah I know.' I kissed her once more and took a step back. I'm sure if we had a choice we would be doing this all night.

'Good bye.' She said taking a step forward to kiss me on the cheek, but I turned my head ever so slightly so that she kissed my lips.

'Bye and I'm missing you already.' I said and began to walk away from the house, toward my home.

Nikolette's Pov

Gosh I am such and IDIOT! I was supposed to talk to Nyk [pronounced NICK] about me graduating a year early with him. Well it's not my fault he's so darn HOT, I thought as I was lying down on my bed after Nyklus walked me home, I can't help the way Nyk stares into my eyes. He LOVES me!

Sigh... I'll just tell him after school tomorrow.

Shaayne's Pov

I'm frustrated. Sexually. I haven't told anyone though, not even Toshya.

Me and Tosh are both virgins [the only virgins in our click] and she wants to wait for the perfect time. I'm not saying I cant wait because I can, but it hurts. Toshya tortures me unknowingly!

Well I guess the reason Tosh doesn't know is because I don't tell her, I some what enjoy it. The way she walks turns me on. She sways her hips in the most sexy motion. Ugh, but I love her soo...

Toshya Pov

I've noticed a look in Shaayne's eyes lately. Lust and intense want.

I understand he has needs, I do also, but I want our first time to be perfect.

His birthday is next weekend and I think that would be the BEST gift to give him.

I need to plan his party though...

I need to talk to the world's number one party planner CYTHANIE!

So I called her...

[phone conversation]

Cythanie: 'hello?' (in a breathless voice)

Toshya: "hey Cyth its me Tosh I was wondering if you could help me with Shaayne's

birthday party plans...'

Cythanie: 'sorry Tosh but I cant at the moment –ungh! Ish cut it out- I'm in the middle of Ish's 'Cythanie time' and he's having his evil way with me'

[Ish takes the phone a way from Cythanie]

Ish: 'we're almost finished Tosh but don't think Cythanie would be able to talk after I'm done she might be too pooped out to do anything.'

Cythanie in the back ground: 'will too!' [you can here a bed squeak and a loud scream coming from Cythanie] 'okay I guess I wont...'

Toshya: 'okay well talk to you tomorrow then guys. BYE!'

Ish and Cythanie: moans and hangs up...

Okay EW!!!! I called in the middle of them having S.E.X.! well I better go to sleep.

I have a big day of planning...

Cythanie Pov

'Ish! You could've at least paused for a sec while I was on the phone with Tosh!' I said breathless under Ish.

'Well I'm sorry that your just so incredibly sexy that I cant stand not giving you your most deserved pleasure.'

'You sure do know how to talk your way out of getting in trouble.' I said raising an eyebrow.

'I was going to be in trouble?' he said raising an eyebrow.

'That you were.' I said flipping us over so that I was on top. 'That you were.'

I kissed him and we carried on with our beautiful night.

Ish Pov

Good morning world. I called out in my head as I got up to go to school the next morning. Last night was unbelievable it felt so good and so right. Cythanie was still in my bed sound asleep, beautiful as always. I slowly walked over to her side of the bed and kissed her softly on the cheek.

Cythanie moaned and rolled over, wrapping her arms around me neck.

'Good morning.' She smiled, her lips inches from mine.

'It is, when I wake up next to you.' I smiled and lifted her up, so that she was now sitting up in the bed, with her arms still wrapped around my neck.

'You're so corny.' She giggled and pushed me away so that she could get up for the morning and get dressed. Cythanie had a small proportion of my wardrobe for her clothes, for when she stayed over un-expectantly.

She grabbed a pair of black skinny leg jeans, a long sleeve cheater pattern shirt that came up to her belly button and a white singlet to wear underneath and a pair of black converse shoes.

Cythanie smiled over to me as she walked into my bathroom to have a shower.

I sighed and fell back onto my bed.

Nyklus Pov

As I walked down Nikolette's street that morning I noticed how peaceful this side of town was. I was nervous to nock on her front door but I was going to have to.

I quietly knocked on the front door, hoping that Nikolette's father didn't answer the door.

'Hello Nyklus.' Nikolette's father looked down at me.

'Hello sir, I'm here to pick up Nikolette.' I smiled nicely and looked around him to find her standing near the stairs.

'Come on in.' He smiled as nicely as he could and opened the door wide for me.

'Thank you sir.' I smiled and walked over to my sweet heart.

'I missed you.' I whispered and kissed her cheek.

'I missed you to.' She giggled and wrapped her arms around my waist.

'Are you ready to go?' I asked resting my chin on her head, as we stood still embraced in a hug.

'Yep.' She made a popping noise.

'Okay.' I smiled and pulled her out the front door, after she said goodbye to her father.

'Goodbye Mr. Nixon.' I smiled as I pulled Nikolette out the front door and down the street. Nikolette had brought her skateboard today, so we road side by side toward the school.

'What did you want to talk about?' I asked remembering the phone call I received from her late last night.

'Um... um... I was thinking about maybe finishing school early. Graduating with you.' she smiled at me, her icy blue eyes sending shivers down my spine. Like they always did.

'Why would you want to do that?' I slowed my skateboard.

'Because I don't want to spend a whole year with out you.' she road close to me.

'Your mother will never agree to it... let alone your father.' I concentrated on the footpath in front of me.

'My mother does agree and my father... well lets just say my father lost the argument.' She sighed.

'Really... they would let you do that.' I jumped off my skateboard and swooped Nikolette into my arms.

'You don't mind?' she squealed.

'Why would I mind... I love you that's all that matters.' I laughed and kissed her ever so passionately.

'I love you to.' She whispered after the kiss.

We remained like this for a few moments, embracing each other. That was until we were rudely interrupted.

'Hey guys I hope you know that you will be late if you two don't hurry up.' It was Shaayne and Toshya.

'Hey.' I smile and put Nikolette back on her feet and picked up her skateboard and my own.

'Why do you two look so happy for?' Toshya smiled and began to walk beside us.

'It's a long story. We will tell everyone at lunch.' I smiled and grasped Nikolette's hand.

Nikolette Pov

The walk to school was fun, with two of my friends and the love of my life.

However once at school, I realized that we have to go our separate ways. I hated leaving Nyk; it caused my heart to ace at the thought of it.

'I love you.' I stood on the tips of my toes and kissed Nyk goodbye before heading off to homeroom.

He smiled and kissed me once more before I was gone and then headed off to his class.

\----------------Lunch time--------------

As I walked to my group at lunch time I was faced by the person that I hate the most.

'Hello Nikolette.' Mark smiled at me sinisterly.

'Oh hello...is it me or are you wearing make up, because I was pretty sure by the end of lunch you had a black eye.' I laughed and walked on by him not even looking him in the eyes.

'I would watch your mouth bitch... someone might want to do something about it one day.' He turned on his heel and marched down the hallway in a huff, which caused me to laugh.

When Nyk saw me strolling toward the group, he jumped up and threw his arms around me.

He draped his arm over my shoulder as we walked toward the rest of the group.

'Now will you tell us what is going on between the two of you?' Cythanie whined.

'Nikolette is going to graduate with us.' Nyk said with excitement.

Everyone's face show signs of shock and understanding... I felt a bit awkward and uncomfortable, but these people were my friends they would understand.

*After school Toshya's house*

Toshya Pov

Cythanie and Nikolette were over my house today to plan Shaayne's surprise party, while Ish and Nyklus distracted Shaayne at a skate park.

'So first order of business is entertainment, Toshya what type of music would you like at the party?' Cythanie said with a clipboard in hand. That's why I like Cythanie she always takes charge and is always prepared.

'Um I was thinking we could play all of his favorite bands. We could find some sophomore to DJ. But it's a Junior/Senior party and the sophomore will get to invite a few other of his/her friends.' I said. Cythanie wrote that down.

'Okey dokey lemon pokey, next is snacks.' She said looking up from her clipboard.

'Well Shaayne like tacos.' I said.

'And apple juice.' Nikolette added.

'Oh and don't forget the Spicy Nacho Doritos.' I added. Cythanie wrote all this down.

'So tacos, apple juice and Spicy Nacho Doritos? Okay... next is decoration colors Tosh.'

'Red and black.' I answered.

'Okaaay. So Tosh what are you getting Shaayne?' she said waggling her eyebrows.

'Um I was planning to um give him my um virginity.' I stuttered blushing.

'Awww how sweet!' Nikolette said.

'He'll love it! Omg this call for a shopping trip! We need to get you some lingerie.' Cythanie said. But she pronounced lingerie ling-ery. She was never good with French.

'We'll go this weekend!' Nikolette squealed.

'Um okay guys. Cythanie when did you and Ish first have sex?' I asked.

'After we confessed our love for each other. The next day was when he proposed.'

'What about you Nik?' I asked.

'The same as Cythanie.' She said blushing.

'Okay so tomorrow we'll secretly tell everybody about Shaayne's party. Make sure you tell them it's a surprise party,' she looked at Nikolette then. 'We can't let him find out.' Cythanie said. 'Well I gotta get home, Amerie and Ashton are visiting from college.' Amerie is Cythanie older sister. They're total opposites Cythanie's loud and exotic and Amerie is a PREP. But they totally love each other. Ashton is Amerie's twin. They are two years older than Cythanie.

Cythanie gathered all her stuff. 'See ya Cythanie.' I said.

'Ya I gotta get home too laters Tosh. Come on Cyth.' They walked out my room and closed the doors behind them.

I fell asleep with a smile on my face...

Chapter 8

\----------Nikolette Pov------------

That weekend, Cythanie and I took Toshya shopping for lingerie. We went to my favorite lingerie store in town called 'X-rated lingerie'. They sold all the top line lingerie and bed wear.

Toshya looked around for a moment, at different types of lingerie while Cythanie and I stood back to only say something when asked.

'Come on you have to help me...' Tosh placed her hands on her hips and pouted. A large grin grew on both Cythanie's face and mine. We madly walked around the store looking for what would best suit Tosh; we pulled out red, black, blue and white lingerie and told her to try them on.

'What one do you think I should get?' Tosh, said holding up her two favorites, which was the black and red lingerie.

'Black.' Cythanie and I said at the same time. Toshya smiled and went to the cash register to pay.

All that we needed to do now was to get a new outfit for the party tonight.

In the end Toshya ended up getting a black dress that was tight fitting around the chest and it flared out until it reached her knees, underneath Toshya was going to wear the lingerie that she bought and fish net stockings and high platform heels.

Toshya was going to be so gorgeous tonight, not even Shaayne is going to be able to resist her.

\-------Later that night-------

Shaayne was going to be picked up by Ish, Cythanie and Toshya, seems Ish was the only person in our group who has a car. He doesn't use it that much, because he rather be riding his skateboard.

Shaayne's parents were nice enough to let us borrow their house for the night so that we could through the surprise party for Shaayne.

Shaayne and Tosh, Cythanie and Ish were out at the movies, both Nyk and I made an excuse so that we could set up the party, while they were gone.

I had come over early so I could help set up the decorations, to only find that they were already done. Even the food was cooked.

'Well I feel totally useless.' I said throwing my arms up in the air.

'Your not useless, why would you say something like that?' Nyk pouted and wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me close to his body. Nyklus ran his hand up my thigh and under my skirt. It caused shivers to run down my spine. I so badly wanted to take him right then and there, but I couldn't just yet.

'Nyklus, sweetie not yet... okay. People will be arriving soon.' I said stepping out of his hug, so that I could turn around and face him.

A large pout crossed his face; I hated looking at him when he does that. It makes me feel like I have done something wrong.

I crossed the small distance between us and kissed him so passionately it made my head spin.

'Later okay.' I winked just as the doorbell rang.

'Later then.' A seductive smile grew across his face.

I pulled open the front door and let the guests in, one of which was the DJ. A few mores guests and the birthday boy, then the party can start.

We had planed everything to perfection. The guest were to arrive around 7:30pm and then at 8:00pm Tosh and the others were to arrive.

Looking over the medium size crowd, I could tell that everyone was here. All we needed now was the birthday boy.

\--------Toshya pov--------

Everyone was quiet as we drove to Shaayne's place, Cythanie and Ish in the front and Shaayne and I in the back.

'So turning the big seventeen aye.' Ish said as we turned another corner.

'Yeah...' Shaayne smiled and looked over to me.

'Did you get what you wanted for your birthday?' Cythanie asked.

'Err... um... not really.' He answered, as he stroked my hand.

'What did you get?' I smiled.

'I got a few things off my parents and family, like a T.V for my room, a new Skateboard, which was cool and a few other things.' He looked out the window. We were now a block away from Shaayne's place and it was 8:00. I smiled, as I started to get excited about the party, for my Shaayne.

'They sound pretty awesome.' Ish smiled in the rear view mirror.

'Yeah the skateboard, handles really well. Its like getting a brand new car.' Boys and their toys.

'I might have to check it out latter.' Ish quickly shot a smile over his shoulder at Shaayne.

'Sure, why not. Come over tomorrow and you can take it for a spin.' He laughed.

'Were here.' Ish smiled and pulled the car over to the side of the road.

'Do you two want to come inside for a drink or something?' I asked. Shaayne shot me a quick glance, he wanted alone time with me, but he wasn't going to get it... yet.

'Sure, that's if Shaayne doesn't mind?' Cythanie smiled politely.

'Not at all.' he sighed and jumped out of the car and crossed his lawn, with the three of us on his tail.

Shaayne slowly opened the door and stepped inside, all the lights were switched off and there was no music or anything playing.

'SURPRISE!!!!!!!!' millions of voices called out at the same time as someone switched on a light.

Standing in the middle was Nyklus and Nikolette, large smiles spread across their faces as they crossed the room and pulled Shaayne into a hug.

'Happy Birthday.' They said at the same time.

'It was all Toshya's idea.' Cythanie place a hand on Shaayne's shoulder.

'Thank you so much all of you.' he smiled and pulled me into a hug.

'I love you.' I smiled as the music started up.

\------------Later that night or should I say early that morning after the party----------

'I can't believe that you threw a surprise party for me.' Shaayne smiled and pulled me into a hug.

'That was only the group present.' I smile seductively. 'My present for you is this way.' I grabbed his hand and lead him up stairs to his room.

\----------Shaayne Pov-----------

'My present for you is this way.' Toshya smiled seductively at me and led me upstairs toward my bedroom. On my bed was a small red box; Toshya nodded me to go forward.

I slowly crossed my room and picked up. It was a medium size and painted black, with splices of different colors.

I opened the box and inside was a folded piece of paper. I unfolded it.

I love you so much that I want to be with you for the rest of my life.... <3

I think you should turn around.

I read the last sentence twice. 'Turn around.' Okay...

I turned around slowly and saw Toshya standing near my bedroom door, which was now closed and she no longer had on her dress, she was just wearing black lacy lingerie.

Toshya was standing seductively and motioned me to come forward.

When I was standing just in front of her, she smiled and wrapped her arms around my neck.

'This is your present...' she whispered. 'I want you all of you.' she kissed me and pushed me back toward my bed.

'Are you sure this is what you want?' I said out of breath.

'Yes.' She replied, while lifting my shirt over my head.

'Then you must know...' I said stopping her from going any further.

'What?' she smiled.

'I love you with all my heart, I will never stop loving you.' I brought her head down so that I could kiss her luscious lips.

\--------------Nikolette pov--------------

'The party couldn't have been any better.' Nyk said I as we walked into his house.

'I know and I think Shaayne is going to love Toshya's present.' I giggled and ran upstairs to Nyk's bedroom, while he locked the front door.

'What she get him?' as if he didn't know.

'Let me try and give you an idea.' I giggled once more and wrapped my arms around his neck and crashing my lips onto his.

Nyklus began to rub my thighs and broke the kiss, bringing his lips to my neck.

'I love you.' his breathe, sending tingles down my spine.

'I love you to.' I lifted his shirt over his head and kissed the tattoo above his heart.

Chapter 9.

\---------Toshya's Pov-------------

The next morning I woke up in a good mood, I had never felt like this before and I'm not sure if I could really describe it.

I think I was on cloud 9... I sighed and rolled over so that I was now staring into Shaayne's blue eyes... they we absolutely beautiful, unlike my light brown eyes.

'Good morning.' I whispered and kissed Shaayne's cheek.

\-----------Nikolette's Pov--------

I took in a large breath of air; I could smell the pine trees over to my left and the rose bushes to my right. Together they combined to make a lovely scent.

I was walking home from Nyklus' place, it was probably eight thirty in the morning and I was tired as hell. My feet were sore and my head hurt and I was still in the clothes that I wore last night.

Nyklus was back at his place still in bed... I didn't want to wake him and make him want to walk with me. I wasn't one of those Girlfriends that are overbearing and make their boyfriends follow them like a shadow. I give Nyk the space he needs and the respect and love he disserve.

'The beautiful Nikolette.' A husky voice pulled me out of my private thoughts. I stopped and turned around to find Mark standing in front of me with his hands on his hips.

'Hello Mark.' I said being polite, even though he didn't deserve it.

'Going home?' unfortunately Mark lives near me.

'Sadly yes, how about you?' I smiled nicely at him.

'Yes, would you like some company?' wow.... Were

did that come from? He must be tricking me. That was when I noticed that he had a small pained expression on his face. I felt sorry for him... What ever his problem was.

'Sure why not.' I smiled; turned and began to walk away.

'So why are you walking home this early in the morning?' I smiled and looked over at him.

'Ah... I broke up with Janette.' Ouch... they had been going out since... well it's been so long that I can't even remember when their first date was anymore.

'I'm sorry.' I said being sincere, I reached up and placed my hand on his shoulder. As much as I didn't like Mark... he was human... even if he didn't show it.

'Don't be your not the person that told her to cheat on Me.' what a slut!

'This isn't any of my business. But who with.'

'Archer.' That would have hurt even more, his best friend.

'What a dick.' I removed my hand and continued to walk next to Mark.

'Yeah that's what his girlfriend said.' He grumbled... 'If you don't mind I don't want to talk about this right now.' He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.

'Okay.' I smiled and let the conversation drop.

'So... um why isn't Nyklus walking you home like he normally does?'

'He still in bed sleeping and I didn't want to wake him up... so here I am walking home with you. Not that I have a problem with that.' I smiled and looked down at the ground.

'After all the crap that I have put you and your friends, you still being nice to me.' Mark sighed.

'Not everyone in the world is a dick all the time.' I giggled and looked at bunch of small kids playing on the other side of the street.

The rest of the walk to home was quiet, but it wasn't unbearable.

'Thanks for walking home with me.' I smiled and placed my hand on his shoulder once more. 'I'm sorry for what happened to you... Janette doesn't deserve you.' I couldn't believe that I just said that, but I meant it.

'Thanks Nikolette.' He pulled me into a hug, which surprised both Mark and myself.

'Sure... um no problem.' I giggled nervously and pushed myself away from him. 'If you need anyone to talk to just come by and I will listen.' I smiled and walked up my front steps and watched him walk into his house, which was next door.

\------Nikolette's Pov------

Mark had sort of freaked me out a bit the other day, when he gave me a hug but I soon got over it. Mainly because he came over and saw me almost everyday, it was either at school or when I got home. I hadn't told Nyk because I knew he would get mad, that I was spending time with his enemy but Mark needed my help and I always go out of my way to help people.

'Nikolette... someone at the door for you!' my father called up the stairs, I knew who it would be before I reached the bottom of the stairs.

'Hey Mark, are you okay?' I smiled and gestured him to come inside. I led him up stairs and into my bedroom. My room wasn't large but it wasn't small either, all the walls were red, my bed black and white, on one wall was a photo frame filled with millions of little photos of me and my click, then I had my computer desk with a Apple Air Notebook plugged into the wall with a photo frame next to it of me and Nyk. I loved that photo it was the first one we ever took together.

'Wow... is this your room?' Mark did a little spin in the middle of my room looking around the whole entire space.

'Yep... now what seems to be the problem today?' I smiled and sat cross-legged on my bed.

'Janette called and asked if we could get back together.' He sighed and sat on the floor.

'What did you say?' I tilted my head back.

'I said that I would think about it and get back to her soon.' He sounded so professional when he said that, it was as if he was hiring someone for a job.

'Okay... so what are you going to say?' I sighed... why was I helping him?

'I don't know... I felt so betrayed, and I really don't think I want to get back with her.'

'Say no then... You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.' I smiled and sat up properly. 'It's not like your going to lose your popularity just because you're no longer dating her

'That's true... it got to where I am now because I worked for it... playing football isn't easy so yeah I made it here because wanted to do it.' He stood and started to hype himself up.

I smiled and watched him, for most of the afternoon. It felt great to have someone else to talk to other than the people in my click not that I didn't like talking to them, its just that I like talking to other people outside of my little world.

'What are you doing this Saturday?' Mark smiled down at me and pulling me out of my own thoughts.

'Saturday... hmm... nothing at the moment. Why?' I placed a finger on my lips and thought some more.

'Did you want to go see a movie or something?' he continued to beam at me.

'I don't know, Mark... I have a boyfriend remember.' I sighed and thought of Nyklus.

'I know... but it wasn't going to be a date or anything... just friends.' He gave me the cutest look, I hated when people pulled the puppy dogface because I can't help myself but agree with what they say.

'Just friends...' I nodded and smiled.

'Great... I will pick you up at eight...' he beamed once more.

'Sure... okay... I will be ready by then.' I smiled and looked over at the photo of my and Nyk. I don't think that this is classified as cheating; Mark is a friend as long as nothing happens between us its not cheating.

\-------- Two day's later-----

'Hello my love.' Nyk pulled me into his arms and kissed me softly on the lips.

'Hello sweetie.' I smiled and hugged him back. I still hadn't told him about Mark and I don't think I want to either. I wanted to keep our friendship a secret and that way neither of us would get hurt by it.

Mark went around school like he normally did, but the only difference was that he didn't bother to notice my click and me.

'What are you doing this Saturday?' Nyklus smile down at me. I didn't know what to do, I could tell him the truth and risk him getting angry or I could lie and run the risk that he will find out later.

'Sorry I already have plans for this Saturday, how about next week.' I smiled, what I said wasn't a lie and neither the truth.

'Okay... I will find out if we can do something next week, because I'm not sure if I'm working or not.' He sighed and released me from his hug.

'I'm sorry. But I will leave next Saturday booked for you and me time.' I smiled and kissed him on the cheek before heading off to class.

\--------Nyklus's Pov---------

'Is it me or has Nikolette been a bit distant the past few days?' I asked Ish as we walked to Ancient History together.

'I don't know but what ever it is she doesn't want you to know about it.' Ish looked around the class for Cythanie. We found her in the back of the classroom with two seats saved for us. Ish was excited to see her and nearly ran all the way over to her just to pull her into a hug.

'Hey Cythanie.' Is smiled and sat next to Ish.

'Sweetie... do you know if Nikolette is hiding something from the rest of the group, because Nyk thinks that she is being a bit distant.' Ish stunned her with a dazzling smile.

'Um... if you want I will ask her this afternoon.' She smiled over at me.

'Thanks.' I sighed and concentrated on the work that needed to be done in this period.

\-------Nikolette's Pov-----

'Yes the day is finally over.' I smiled over at Nyk as we walked home after school that afternoon.

'Mm...' he mumbled some words and continued to walk towards my house.

'What's the matter Nyk?' I sighed and stopped in the middle of the pathway.

'You...' he whispered. 'You seem so distant lately and I don't know what I have done.' he looked down at me with pain in his eyes.

'What are you going on about? I put my hands on my hips.

'What are you hiding from me... seriously I promise that I wont get mad what ever it is.'

'You wouldn't understand.' I looked down at my feet.

'Try me.' he grasped my hands.

'Mark and I have been spending a lot of time together after school.' Nyklus removed his hands from mine and took a step back.

'Why would you want to spend time with him? He doesn't even like us.' He half yelled at me.

'I told you, that you wouldn't understand.' I threw my hands up in the air.

'But why Nikolette?' he calmed down.

'Because he needs a true friend right now. If you haven't heard he broke up with Janette and he needs some help...' I poked him in the chest. 'And just because he doesn't like you, doesn't mean that he hates me.' I grumbled and walked away, heading toward home.

'Nikolette, wait... come on... I'm sorry.' I could hear Nyklus run after me.

'Nyklus what is your problem? Aren't I allowed to have other friends other than you and the group!' I spun on my heel to face him.

'You're allowed to have as many friends as you want, but why does it have to be Mark?'

'I can pick anyone I want.' I yelled. 'Why can't you understand that he is my friend?'

'Because, he never just wants to be friends.' He yelled and threw his hands in the air.

'Whatever Nyklus.... I'm going home with or without you.' with that last word I stormed off in the direction of home.

This was the first ever fight I had with Nyklus and I didn't know how to cope with it. When I got home tears were flowing down my eyes and I stormed up to my room.

I pulled out my apple iphone and messaged Cythanie.

Just had fight with Nyk.

Cythanie

What over??

Me

Mark... we are just friends and Nyk didn't like that one bit.

Cythanie

He must be jealous that's all... it happens to guys all the time...

Me

But it just felt like he wanted to control, what friends I'm allowed and not allowed to have.

Cythanie

What were his last words to you??

Me

He didn't have the last words... I did... all I said was Whatever Nyklus, and then I stormed off...

Cythanie

Wow you called him Nyklus... I haven't heard you call him that in ages... :O

Me

Yeah I know... I kind of feel bad that I yelled at him but Mark just need a true friend and I was that person... seems I have known him since I was just a kid... sigh what am I going to do...

Cythanie

Call him and make up...

Me

Okay...

Cythanie

Fingers crossed everything will get better :)

Me

Thanks

I sighed and placed my phone down on my bed and I lay back, and tried to think clearly.

What was I going to do? I love him so much but I have never had an argument with him before.

Scene Kidz

Chapter 11

*Nyklus's Pov*

*Saturday*

I can't believe this! Why would Nikolette become friends with our nemesis! The person who made our high school years HELL! She could've picked anyone else, but noooo she picked Mark.

She said that I wouldn't understand. /I'm/ her boyfriend I would understand her better than anyone!

I got her name tattooed on my chest! She should be able to tell us anything!

She said today she was busy. She better not be busy with Mark or there will be trouble.

*Nikolette Pov*

Mark set off to the movie-plex a couple streets from our house.

We were going to see The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. It would be my second time seeing it. The first time I went with the group.

We settled in the threatre and talked while the previews showed.

A few seats down a couple sat down...

*Cythanie's Pov*

Ish took me out for a date today. We had a picnic at our favorite park where we sneak away at night, and now he's taking me to the movies to see Eclipse again!

The previews were on so we decided to make out. Good thing it was kinda dark.

I pulled away for air and Ish started sucking on my neck. I was giggling like a little school girl.

I opened my eyes and saw Nikolette and Mark sitting a couple of seats down.

What the HELL are they doing here! You don't go to the movies alone with a friend. Friends go in a large group. Not just the two of them.

'Ish!' I whispered/yelled. He just continued on sucking my next. I felt him smile. The jerk thought I was moaning! If he kept this up I would have a HUGE A** hickey. Ashton and my dad will hunt him down.

'Ish baby stop and look!' he reluctantly pulled away and looked behind him. I felt him tense.

I knew Ish would bolt right up and go over there. So I grabbed him and sat on him.

'Calm down Ish. They're not doing anything so let's just watch and see 'kaay?'

'Anything for you' he said kissing the top of my head.

We waited for the movie was over and they left, so we could leave.

Ish was still kinda tense when we were driving back to his house. We went into his living room and defiled his mothers' couch.

;)

*Nikolette's Pov*

We walked home in silence. Mark walked me up to my front door like a gentleman.

'Thanks Mark I had fun.' I hugged him.

'No problem. I had fun too.' We pulled apart and Mark had this weird look in his eyes. A look similar to the one Nyklus gets every time he sees me. OH NO!

He lent down and F*CKING kissed me!

He soon pulled away when he noticed I wasn't responding to the kiss.

'Mark! I said we were just friends!' I shrieked before running into my house.

I ran up to my room and called the one person I knew who would understand my issues as a girl.

*Cythanie's Pov*

Ugh, why do Tosh and Nik call at the wrong times?

Ish and I were cuddling naked on his moms' couch when Nikolette called.

I didn't feel like holding the phone up to my ear so I put it on speaker and set the phone on Ish's shoulder.

'Cythanie?' a frantic Nikolette said.

'Yeah?'

'Mark kissed me!' she exclaimed.

When she said that Ish head sprung up and he quickly pulled his clothes back on and ran out the house.

AW F*CK!!!!!!!!

Chapter 12

\-----Nikolette's Pov----

Cythanie picked up the phone; at first she didn't say anything.

'Cythanie.' I squeaked.

'Yeah.' She said out of breath...

'Mark kissed me!' I didn't know what else to say... I was so confused. As I listened for a reply I heard some ruffle of clothing and then the slamming of a door.

'Cythanie... did you have me on speaker?' I said feeling the tears build up in my eyes.

'I'm sorry... I didn't know what you wanted and Ish was here, but I don't know where he is now.' She said in a worried tone.

'God damn it Cythanie... all I wanted is someone to talk to about how bad I felt that he kissed me, but you just got me into deeper trouble.' I half yelled down the phone.

'Well you should have known that Mark wouldn't treat you like a friend for very long... you brought it upon yourself.' She said angrily.

'What ever.' I screeched and hung up. What was I going to do? Knowing Ish he is already over at Nyk's place telling him everything.

I sighed and fell to the floor at the foot of my bed. Tears filled my eyes at the thought of Nyk yelling at me again.

\------ Ten minutes later-----

'Nikolette... Ish is here.' My father yelled up to me.

'Tell him to go away... I'm not in the mood to be yelled at right now.' I said after a moment, but unfortunately my father had let him in and let Ish make his way up the stairs into my room.

'What do you want... to make my day even worse.' I grumbled and stood to size him up.

Ish was at least a foot taller than me, he didn't scare me.

'What is your problem? Nyk loves you so much and then you go and cheat on him.' he yelled at me.

'You don't even know the whole story! And don't you dare... don't you dare judge me.' I pocked him in the chest.

'What is the whole story, Nikolette?' he knocked my hand way.

'He kissed me... I didn't want it to happen, because I love Nyklus so much...' the tears began to flow down my cheeks.

'He kissed you... how original.' He rolled his eyes and moved away from me.

'What do you want me to say? That I have it in for Mark... cause I wont because I don't like him that way.' I sobbed and I moved to sit on my bed.

'I want you to tell me the truth.' Ish became considerate and sat next to me, placing his arm around me. Ish was like my older brother, that I wish my parents had but they didn't they had Archer who is now in college.

'I told you the truth, why don't you believe me?' I sobbed into his chest.

'Because you kept Mark a secret from everyone in the group, you are our sister. We would understand.' Ish hugged me for a moment.

'But I'm telling the truth.' I sobbed and moved away from Ish, looking him in the eye. He didn't believe me.

'Get out.' I said swallowing my tears and pointing to the door.

'Fine...' he sighed and left me alone in my room.

\-----Mark's Pov------

I kissed her... I actually kissed her... a smile crept across my face as I thought of kissing her full lips again. Her ice blue eyes send shivers down my spine. I had known Nikolette all my life, I had known her since she was just a baby and I was one years old. As I grew, so did she. We used to play as children, but once I made it to high school, we stopped talking. I never why, I think it was because I thought that I was better than her and that she didn't disserve to be noticed by anyone but me.

Yeah I know that sounds like a stupid excuse but that was how I felt when I saw her.

Brrrrr Brrrrr Brrrrr

My phone rung in my pocket.

'Mark.' I sighed not looking at the caller id.

'Could you come over for a while... I really need a friend.' Nikolette sounded like she was in tears. I really didn't want to be more than friends with Nikolette, but it was going to have to work for towards it.

'Sure I will be right over.' I smiled and hung up the phone. I jumped off my bed and made my way over to Nikolette's house.

\------Nyklus' Pov-----

'Ish wow... slow down... what are you trying to say?' I said as I let him into my house.

'I said Mark kissed Nikolette.' He sighed and looked me squarely in the eye, he wasn't joking.

'What!!! How do you know this?' I asked, full of anger.

'Well it all started when I took Cythanie to see Eclipse again, we saw Nikolette there with Mark...' he paused for a moment. 'Nothing happened while we were there. But when Cythanie and me got home, we got a phone call from Nikolette saying that Mark kissed her.' he sighed and moved uneasily around the room.

'That dick... he cant just do that, especially with my Nikolette.' I yelled and marched out of the house.

I jumped into my car and sped down the road to Nikolette's house.

\------Nikolette's Pov----

I was wrapped up in Mark's arms as I cried my eyes out... I was hurt none of my friends understood what I was going through.

'Nikolette Lynn-Marie Nixon!' I heard someone yell outside my bedroom window. I sighed and pulled myself from Mark's arms and made my way over to the window.

Opening it I found Nyklus standing there with his hands on his hips.

'Why didn't you come to the front door?' I yelled down to him, knowing perfectly why he was here.

'Your father didn't let me in. He said that you were upset and that your new friend is up there comforting you.' he yelled at me.

I sighed and moved away from the window, Mark looked at me a longing face. He went to come and pull me into a hug, but I held up my hand and walked out of the room.

Nyklus was leaning on the wall near the back porch.

'I guess Ish told you what happened.' I sighed and sat on the stairs, with my head between my hands.

'He did... so what eventually I would have found out.' He sat next to me, at least he wasn't yelling at me.

'Why aren't you yelling at me like everybody else?' a small sob escaped my chest.

'I'm not everybody else, I'm your boyfriend. I love you, but lately you have been hurting me.' he grabbed my hand and kissed it.

'I love you to, but you don't disserve me after everything I done. I have kept things from you and you have had to find out the hard way what they are. I have cheated on you... not intentionally though... and I'm scared that I will do it again.' I sobbed and removed my hand from Nyk and stood, to find Mark behind us listening to our conversation.

'Mark.' I could see the anger in his eyes, as he looked from Nyklus to me.

'You.' Nyk stood spinning around and looking at Mark. 'How dare you kiss my girlfriend.' He yelled and threw himself at Mark, who was already prepared for his attack.

'STOP. IT. BOTH. OF. YOU!' I screamed and tried to stop the fight from escalating any bigger.

I threw myself at the two of them to only get hit to the ground by Nyk. My hand fluttered to my cheek where it burned like a wild fire. At least the fight stopped between the two of them.

Mark fell to his knees next to me.

'Nikolette are you okay?' his hand went to my cheek. 'You hit her... no man hits a girl.' Mark stood and pushed Nyklus back.

'Nikolette I'm sorry.'

I wanted to say that I was all right but my mouth wouldn't respond. Nyk looked at me with hurt full eyes.

'I think you should leave.' Mark pushed Nyk once more. Nyklus looked over Mark's shoulder waiting for me to say something, but when I didn't he turned on his heel and walked away. The tears that I tried so hard to keep down over flowed and cascaded down my face.

I couldn't stand, I was hurting too much. Not that physically hurt but my heart was hurting so much that I couldn't function well.

'Come on lets get you inside.' My lifted me into his arms and carried me into my room, where he placed me on my bed. He turned to leave, but I grabbed his hand before he could get too far.

'Please don't leave me.' I whispered. Mark nodded and fell onto the bed next to me, he wrapped his arms around me and held me close.

\-------Nyklus' Pov------

I hated myself, right now... I hit my Nikolette. I'm such an idiot. I should have known that she would have thrown herself into the fight to break it up.

'Are you alright man?' Ish was sitting outside the front of his house.

'No. Mark was there.' I yelled to the sky.

'What happen? Did you and Nikolette fix your problems?' I looked over at Ish, his black and white hair blowing in the wind.

'No and Mark and I got into a punch up.' I grumbled and lent against the brick wall.

'Who won?'

'Neither of us...' I sighed, looked down at the ground and then continued. 'Nikolette jumped in to try and break up the fight. I accidentally hit her.' A sob escaped my chest, which was now hurting so much that I began to think that I was going to stop breathing.

'As she okay?' Ish crossed the front lawn and placed a hand on my shoulder.

'I don't know but the look she gave me, broke my heart.'

'Did she say anything?'

'No... she looked at me, it was a look of hatred, but it wasn't a look of forgiveness either.'

My mind traveled back in time, to when I was standing there looking down at Nikolette.

Her cheek burned bright red, it wasn't a soft punch so it could only be expected that it would leave a mark. I could tell that Nikolette was fighting back the tears, her eyes wide with shock.

Mark fell to his knees next to Nikolette as her hand fluttered to her cheek.

'Nikolette are you okay?' Marks hand went to her cheek as she moved it away. I wanted so badly wanted to hold her and tell her that I was sorry, but my legs wouldn't move.

'You hit her... no man hits a girl.' Mark stood and pushed me away, trying to provoke me again.

'Nikolette I'm sorry.'

It looked like she wanted to say something but, after a moment she remained quiet.

'I think you should leave.' Mark pushed me away and blocked my view of Nikolette. I looked over Mark's shoulder waiting for Nikolette to say that she didn't want me to leave, but when she said nothing I realized that I hurt her a lot more than I originally thought. I turned on my heel and marched away, to only hide around the corner of her house and watch Mark lift her into his arms and carry her inside.

I was pulled back to the present with the feel of someone's hand falling onto my shoulder, Cythanie smiled sympathetically at me.

'I'm sure the two of you will get over your little tiff.'

'Thanks, I hope so.' My hand went to my chest where Nikolette's name was tattoo over my heart.

*Monday*

It was now Monday and I still hadn't talked to Nyk about what happened on Saturday afternoon. My cheek was slightly purple, but nothing some makeup couldn't cover up.

Mark drove me to school, in his 2010 Black SS Camaro with tinted windows, tinted brake lamps, tinted side maker lamps, satin black vinyl covering the bow-tie emblems and black with polished lip GM Performance Parts wheels.

(AN: the Car in the slideshow isn't mine... I found it on the net... GOD I wish I had a care that looked that awesome... hahaha... anyway back to the story.)

It is such a beautiful car, and very expensive.

'How is your cheek.' Mark asked after he parked the car in the school and got out. His hand went to my left cheek to stroke it.

'Its getting better.' I sighed, as Mark stroked my cheek I could see Nyklus in the corner of my eye. He was standing with Ish and Cythanie, Toshya and Shaayne. Anger coursed through me as I saw the small smile crept across his face. I pulled Mark into me, hugging him and not letting him go.

'Sorry...' I took a step back, when Nyk stormed off to homeroom.

'Don't be.' A smile crept onto his face as he looked around him.

'So I will see you at lunch.' I smiled and looked up into his greenie-blue eyes. I didn't want to sit with Nyk and the rest of the click, because I knew that they were angry with me. They blamed what happened between Nyklus and I, on me. Which I thought wasn't fair.

'Most certainty what room will you be in?' he tilted his head to the side.

'I'm in room forty-one.' I smiled.

'Wait for me there and I will come by and get you.' he smiled.

'Thanks. Um... I will see you later.' Smiled and turned to head off to class, to only get pulled back into Mark's arms.

'I'm sorry about your cheek, that blow to the face was meant for me.' he stroked it once more before he bent down and kissed it softly.

'Please... not just yet.' I smiled politely and touched his shoulder, hoping that I didn't offend him.

'Okay... not yet.' He smiled and watched me walk away.

Chapter 13

.:Cythanie's Pov:.

As always, it up to me to solve every ones problems. I do not understand why, but I'm always the one who has to settle stuff.

It's been a week since the Nyklus and Nikolette fight and they still haven't talked.

So I took it upon myself to help them.

I stole Toshya away from Shaayne and we headed to Nikolette's house.

'Okay Tosh when we go in there we're going to calmly talk to her no yelling okay?' I said looking at her, she nodded her head. 'And you're going to agree with everything I say okay?' she reluctantly nodded her head with an eye roll. It was probably because I speaking to her as if she were a toddler.

'All right, let's do this!' I exclaimed before knocking on her front door. Her dad answered and said she was up in her room.

We went up the stairs and towards her bedroom. I knocked on her door.

'Come in!' she said hoarsely. She sounded as if she had been crying.

I swiftly opened her door. And there she was, my best friend since diaper days, sitting on her desk chair looking out her window into her backyard.

'Nikolette? We're here to talk.' I said

'If you're here to yell at me, you can save your voice. I already know I screwed up.' She said spinning the chair around towards us.

'We're not going to yell at you. Right Tosh?' she was looking down at the floor. Nyklus was her first cousin. I nudged her and she agreed. 'Of course we're not.' She replied.

'I just got to ask you one question though.' She looked up at me as though she knew what I was going to ask. 'Are you attracted to Mark?'

'Of course not! We're just friends! Although I don't think we can be friends anymore, he's screwing up my love life.' She said with a small smiled.

'Well that's good.' I said, 'I do have a plan to get Nyk to forgive you...'

She hopped up from her computer chair. 'Well don't just stand there! Tell me!' it was funny seeing her anxious.

'You know how the boys have I our names tattooed on their chests?'

'Yes...'

'Well what if we did the same? My aunt is a tattoo artist she could totally hook us up!'

'That's a brilliant idea Cyth; it will benefit all of us! We're gonna get laid!' Tosh squealed. After she and Shaayne had sex she's been a little less embarrassed about sex/

'What do you say Nik?'

'Totally let's do it!'

Chapter 14

Nikolette's POV

'Oh come on it was totally worth it.' Cythanie smiled over at me, before looking down at the tattoo that was on her lower hip.

God I hope that Nyklus forgives me. I missed him so much. As much as I like Mark, I hate him because of all of the things that he done. He had wrecked my life.

I sighed and looked at my lower hip, where I had a heart tattooed and Nyklus' name tattooed around it.

'So now what do we do?' I said looking over at Tosh and Cythanie.

'We need some new lingerie.' Tosh squealed with delight as we walked out off the store.

'Right we need some new lingerie.' Cythanie nodded.

'Okay let's go then.' I smiled. I was actually happy for the first time, being with my friends.

All morning we tried on lingerie and went around to different stores trying on different things.

'So how are we planning this thing?' I asked as I threw my shopping on the floor in my bedroom.

'Well my parents' holiday house isn't being used this weekend, so why don't we all go up there for the night.' Tosh smiled while jumping up and down on my bed.

'Okay, we will go there early and get everything set up and the boys can be there before dinner.' I said, with excitement.

'Its settled then, we are going to Tosh holiday house.' Cythanie smiled and pulled out her phone. She quickly called all the guys and told them to meet us at Tosh's holiday house, up the coats. Of course they all agreed even Nyklus, which sort of surprised me because, Cythanie didn't say anything about me going to be there.

I think Cythanie wanted to surprise him.

Nyklus' POV

I was excited to be getting away from everything; not talking to Nikolette was taking its toll on me. I love that girl with all my heart, seeing her with Mark only made matters worse.

I sighed and lay back on my bed and thought things over.

'Maybe I should invite Nikolette.' I thought to myself.

'She wouldn't want to come any way.' I sighed and looked over at the photo of us together. Those were the good days. I smiled and pulled out my phone.

'Hello.' Nikolette's sweet voice called through the phone.

'Nikolette... its Nyklus.'

'Hey... how are you?' she sounded happy to be talking to me.

'Not too bad... hey I was wondering the click and I were going to Tosh's Holiday house, would you like to come?' there was a long silence, and I could here a couple of mummers.

'Um... sorry not tonight... my father you see... um isn't happy with me at the moment. Next time I promise.'

'Yeah sure... I will talk to you soon.' I sighed.

'Okay.'

'Nikolette.' I quickly said before she could hang up.

'Yeah.'

'I miss you.'

'I miss you to, I promise I will see you soon and we can talk this whole thing over.' It felt like I could feel the smile on her lips.

'Okay, I will see you when ever then.' I smiled at the thought of seeing Nikolette again.

'Bye Nyk.' She said quickly before hanging up.

\------Later that day-----

Nikolette's POV

'Everything set.' I smiled over at the girls as they put the finishing touches on the table.

'Yep all we need now is the boys.' Cythanie smiled. Just then a horn sounded in the front yard.

'Quick Nikolette hid in the next room.' Tosh and Cythanie said at the same time. I nodded and dashed for the next room where I waited patiently for the guys to walk in. I kept my head close to the door, listening for my queue to enter.

'I hope you don't mind Nyk, but we brought you someone to talk to. So you don't feel like a fifth wheel.' Cythanie giggled, while I walked into the room.

Nyk was in shock, his mouth dropped to the ground and I could have sworn that some drool fell to the ground.

'Hi.' I spoke softly walking up to him.

'Nikolette.' He wrapped his arms around me and held me like that I was going to disappear at any moment.

'See I kept my promise.' I smiled into his chest.

'Thank you...' he murmured into my hair.

'After dinner lets go for a walk and talk for awhile.' I continued to smile into Nyk's chest.

'Did you three plan this whole thing?' Ish's voice called through the room.

'Yep.' Tosh said making a popping noise.

'Come on everyone dinner is getting cold.' Cythanie said grabbing Ish's hand and pulling him into the dinning room.

'Well here is to our long and ever lasting friendship.' Ish raised his glass and purposed a toast.

'To friendship.' Everyone said at once and raised their glasses.

Dinner went smoothly, not one argued and no one yelled. It was if nothing happened, everything was back to normal... I hope.

'Who wants dissert?' I smiled seductively at Nyk as I stood and pulled him with me, while Tosh and Cythanie did the same with Shaayne and Ish and pulling them to different parts of the house to reveal their tattoos.

I smiled over at Nyk as we walked along the small lake.

'I'm sorry for everything.' I blurted out all at once.

'I'm sorry that Mark kissed me. I'm sorry that I went behind your back and became his friend. I'm sorry that I didn't talk o you all week, even though it almost killed me. Please forgive me...because I don't see my future without you in it.' I stopped dead in my tracks and looked up at Nyk.

'I forgive you. And I don't see my future without you in it either.' Nyk wrapped his arms around me and kissed the top of my head.

'Thank you.' I whispered into his chest.

'Come you have to see something.' I jumped out of our embrace and pulled Nyk over to the small picnic rug and blankets that I set up for the evening.

I smiled seductively at Nyk and pushed him down on the picnic rug and began to strip in front of him, until I was left only in my new lingerie. I smiled and sat on top of Nyk.

'I got you a present.' I whispered into his ear and lowered my panties, to reveal the tattoo that I had gotten.

'I love you.' I whispered once more and kissed him lightly on the lips.

'I love you, Nikolette Lynn-Marie Nixon.' Nyk smiled as he leant down and kissed my neck.

'Never leave me again.' Nyk's hot breath against my skin sent shivers down my spine.

'I promise.' I lent forward and kissed him passionately. I smiled against his lips, before running my tongue against his lip begging for entrance. Which he granted, with a small moan.

Scene Kidz 15

Mark's POV

I can't believe Nikolette took back that sorry excuse for a man. It was just yesterday that she told me we couldn't be friends anymore.

*FLASHBACK*

I was up in my room, home alone, when the doorbell rang. It was a Sunday and my parents were at the local country club like they are every Sunday, so it couldn't be them.

I raced down the stairs to answer the door. 'Who is it?' I asked without opening the door.

'Mark? Uh it's me. Nikolette?' she sounded nervous, but boy was I happy to see her!

I opened the door and stepped out onto the porch and lightly closed the door.

'Hey Nik! What's up?' I asked. She still seemed nervous. I wonder...

'Heeeeey Mark... we need to talk.' I guided her to the bench swing on my porch.

'Sure, what is it?' I had a feeling that I wasn't going to like this conversation.

'Well... Mark I don't think we can be friends anymore.'

'What do you mean you don't think we /can/ be friends anymore.' I asked getting a little angry.

'You clearly have more feelings for me than friends should. I'm sorry Mark, but you kissed me! You almost ruined Nyklus & me's relationship.'

'So you took him back? After he hit you?' My voice was rising.

'Of course I did! And that was an accident. Which was technically you're fault.'

'Nikolette please, please don't do this. I need you.' I begged. She can't do this to me.

'I'm sorry, we can't. I don't see you in that way. It's not healthy for you if we're friends and you have feelings for me and I can't return them.' She said standing up.

'You haven't even tried! Please Nikolette, I need you!' I sad gripping her wrist.

'I haven't tried because I don't want to love you! I love my Nyklus! I love him so much I'm giving up my senior year and graduating early to go to college with him! And you don't need me! You need a therapist!' [A/n: short question, has anyone noticed therapist is The-Rapist? Sorry I just had to ask.]

She broke free from her grasp and ran to her house.

*END OF FLASHBACK*

I knew she didn't mean that, I knew she loved me.

Who couldn't love me?

It's that damn Nyklus! He's feeding her head those thoughts! I will get her in the end.

I sat in my car Monday morning wait for my Nikolette to come, when I saw her, Cythanie, and Toshya hop off their skateboards. They all were wearing crop tops that read: Got Scene? And jean short shorts. They were all very hot, especially Cythanie, but Nikolette was my love interest. My gaze lingered on a marking on her lower hip.

It was a heart with Nyklus's f*cking name in it! They all had them. [They're respectably boyfriends]

He obviously forced her to get it.

I mean, she wouldn't do that to me.

She loved me.

I WILL GET HER! SHE WILL BE MINE!

By this time I was seeing red. I angrily drove my car out the parking lot and to my house, where I will come up with my plan to get what I want. I want Nikolette. And I always get what I want.

And I won't stop until Nikolette is securely under me begging for more.

Chapter 16 part 1

Marks Pov

I sped down the road, to where she lived...

'This plan has to work.' The voice in my head called out to me.

'Of course it will work... this is her best friend... her sister. Nikolette will want to save her.' I spoke out loud, into the silence of my car.

'And then I will make her see that she does love me.' I chuckled evilly.

I pulled my car up to Toshya's house, I knew that Shaayne wouldn't be there because he had work this afternoon and

Toshya's parents we still at work. Leaving Toshya all by herself.

I quickly jumped out of my car and walked up to the front porch and rung the doorbell. Within seconds Toshya answered the door, with a large smile that disappeared when she noticed it was just me.

'Um... Mark what are you doing here?' Toshya looked nervously around the front yard.

'Could I talk to you for a minute.' I acted innocent and gestured toward the pathway that led up to the house. Toshya nodded and came out of the house and walked by my side. Until we reached my car, where I lent on it for a moment.

'What seems to be the problem?' Toshya grumbled and folded her arms over her chest.

'I wanted to ask you something... about Nikolette.' I smiled.

'Couldn't you have asked her... seriously. Plus I thought she told you that she didn't want to be your friend anymore.' She grumbled and poked her finger into my chest.

'Oh she did.' I quickly grabbed Toshya and threw her into the boot of my car.

'Hey what are you doing?' she screamed as the lid came crashing down, sealing her escape.

'Getting Nikolette back...' I laughed and went to lock the front door of Toshya's hose and leave a note for my Nikolette to find, when she arrives here in another half an hour.

I swiftly jumped into my car and drove away.

Nikolette's Pov

'Mum, Dad... I'm leaving.' I called out to my parents as I walked out my front door, with my skateboard in one hand and my backpack in another.

It was Friday afternoon and Cythanie and I were sleeping over at Toshya's place. We were going to have a girl's night out.

It is going to be so much fun... I almost squealed with delight.

I rounded the corner of Toshya's street, it was quiet as always but it was a good quiet. I could hear the wheels of my skateboard hit the ground hard every time I went over a bump; I love the feel of the wind flying through my hair.

If I could be any animal in the world I would have to be a bird. I could fly anywhere and everywhere I wanted and not get stopped, I would be carefree and have no worries whets so ever.

I rode up Tosh's pathway and up to her front porch, where I found Cythanie sitting on the front steps with some sort of piece of paper in her hands. She stretched out her hand toward me.

It was an envelope with my name on it. I slowly opened it... the letter read.

Dearest Nikolette,

I have your friend Toshya... now, now don't get hysterical. Just remain calm.

Nothing will happen to her, if you come alone.

Let me repeat that just to make sure that it's clear ALONE!

You should remember the place I told you about.

If not you should hurry up and remember because I'm not going to wait all night.

Love always Mark oxox

P.S. you will be mine.

Why would he take her? She is like a sister to me.

I closed my eyes and thought... where was the place he told me about.

\---Flash back---

'Hey Nik.' Mark galloped over to me one Tuesday, during lunch and pulled me into a hug. This was when Nyk and I were still fighting.

'Hey Mark...' I smiled brightly at him, returning the hug and walking off toward his group of friends.

'Um I was wondering what are you doing next weekend?' Mark beamed at me.

'Not sure why? What did you want to do?' I asked with a tat of curiosity.

'I was wondering if you wanted to come to my parents cabin?... Do you remember it... we used to go there a lot as kids.' Mark stopped walking and looked me directly in the eyes. Yes I remembered it and did I want to go? NO!

'Um... I will have to talk to my father and get back to you.' I smiled politely. I really didn't want to go to his family cabin, but I didn't know how to politely say no.

\---End of flash back---

'Nikolette.' Cythanie stood in front of me waving her hands in front of my face, trying to capture my attention.

'What?' I asked in a shaky voice.

'Shaayne, Ish and Nyk just arrived.' I turned around and watched the boys walk up the footpath and over to me.

'You called them?' I shrieked.

'Yes we need their help and they have a right to know as well.' Cythanie calmly spoke to me.

'Where has he taken her?' Shaayne yelled at the top of his lungs.

I took a deep breath and thought for a moment.

Should I tell them where the cabin is? Or should I just go by myself just like Mark wants.

'He has taken her to his family cabin.' I spoke softly looking at the ground. Instantly Nyk wrapped his arms around me and held me tight, he knew what I wanted to do. Even though he didn't approve of it, it was the only way to get Tosh back.

'Okay here is the plan.' I spoke quickly to the group.

\---Later that evening---

Shaayne drove silently down the dirt road toward the cabin, where Mark was keeping Tosh. Neither one of us had talked since we left the house, and I didn't think that we were going to talk until we got Tosh back.

It took all but five minutes to drive from the freeway to cabin. I was shaking in my boots... literally. I was wearing my favorite black skinny leg jeans, red tank top and leather jacket and my hiking boots. If I remembered correctly, and so far I have. The whole forest that surrounded the cabin wasn't very flat, so I thought I might want to put on some comfortable shoes on.

'Remember wait in the car.' I quickly said to Shaayne as we neared the cabin. Shaayne nodded and stopped short of the driveway.

I swiftly jumped out of the car and ran up to the front door, where I banged hard on till Mark opened it.

'Are you alone?' he asked not opening the door.

'Yes and no.' I yelled.

'What did I say!' he yelled back at me.

'To come alone yes... but someone had to drive Tosh home.' The door opened a bit to reveal Marks face. He looked out to the car where Shaayne sat, whose eyes fixed on the door and me.

'Now let Tosh go... you have what you want. I'm here please just let her go.' I spoke softly and calmly. Mark nodded and let me come in to release Tosh, who was sitting on the bed, with her arms and legs bound and a gag in her mouth.

I quickly ran to her side and untied her.

'Are you okay?' I wrapped my arms around her, once I had gotten the gag out of her mouth.

'Yes... thank you for coming and getting me.' Tosh sobbed.

'Shaayne is waiting for you outside.' I pulled back and looked Tosh directly into her eyes. Tosh nodded as I pulled her to her feet and over to the door. Where Tosh immediately went into a sprint over to the car and jumped in. Shaayne quickly pulled her into an embrace and kissed her on the forehead.

Just as he was about to reverse out of the driveway, he nodded thanks to me.

I slowly turned my attention back to Mark who was waiting for me to move away from the door.

'I'm here now... what do you want?' I grumbled and moved away from the door.

'I want you... all of you.' Mark wrapped his arms around my waist and began to kiss my neck. I didn't like that one bit. I love Nyklus and I wasn't going to let what happened last time happen again.

I sighed and stomped on Marks foot, and jumped out of his reach.

'What was that for?' he yelled at me.

'I love Nyk... not you. NYK!' I screamed at him.

'No you don't you love me...' Mark pulled me into his arms.

'Nyklus is feeding you lies and you are believing him... I bet you he even forced you to get that tattoo.' Mark tugged on the side of my jeans to reveal the tattoo of a heart with Nyklus' name in it.

'I love him...always have and always will.' I pushed Mark away and corrected my pants.

'I will have you one way or another.' Mark came at me with a knife. This wasn't part of my plan... shit.

'Even if you do rape me Mark... I will never love you... I will hate you.' I yelled and backed away from him.

'Who said anything about rapping.' A sinister smile crept across Marks face and he stepped forward.

I was now backed up against the wall with nowhere else to go. Mark brought the knife to my neck and held it there, just inches from my throat.

'You will give me permission to sleep with you.' Mark said in a deep voice.

'And you will like it.' He sneered at me.

'NEVER!' I pushed his hand away and fort back. I held Marks hand in one of my and the hand with the knife in my other.

This wasn't going to end happily.

Nyklus' POV

I saw Shaayne drive past as Ish and I sat in Ish's mothers Four-wheel drive.

'Come on... go...' I yelled at Ish.

This was all of Nikolette's idea she had Shaayne drop her off and pick up Tosh, then all he had to do was drive back up the drive way and then we would go speeding down to save Nikolette.

I was worried for Nikolette... yeah she said she would be fine but I'm still terrified for her.

It took us all but two minutes to speed down the bumpy driveway to where the cabin was. I jumped out of the four-wheel

drive and ran over to the door.

'NEVER!' I heard Nik yell through the door, followed by the sound of shuffling and grunting.

Shit he is rapping her. I quickly barged opened door to find Nik and Mark fighting... I looked closer and noticed there was a knife in his hand.

'Nikolette.' I yelled out and caught the attention of both Nik and Mark, but that was all it took. Mark swiftly pulled the knife back and lunged it into Nikolette's stomach.

'If I can't have it neither can you.' Mark laughed as Nikolette removed the knife and fell to the floor; I ran to her side and swept her into my arms.

'I'm sorry.' I whispered and walked her out to the car and put her in the back seat.

'Leave him Ish... we can come back later and get him.' I called out and jumped into the drivers seat. I hope that Ish's parents don't mind a few tickets because I was going to run every red light, and speed all the to the Hospital.

Ish jumped quickly in the four-wheel drive and held Nikolette's head on his lap.

I was scared... so scared for her life and all I could think about was getting revenge on Mark.

I waited silently for the nurse to arrive... I was so worried about Nikolette.

When I get my hands on Mark he will pay. He will regret the day he even laid eyes on Nikolette.

I remember how Nikolette would smile every time she saw me walking over to her; this was just after she had gotten over her crush. We were young and the best of friends.

'Excuse me...' a soft and tender voice pulled me back to reality. I looked up with my sore red eyes and focused on the nurse that was looking tenderly at me.

'Is she going to be okay?' I sobbed.

'Yes... she is going to pull through.' The nurse smiled and turned to leave.

'The Police are going to get involved as well... so if were you I would get my story straight.' The nurse quickly turned and smiled; then left. Leaving Ish and I sitting in the waiting room looking at each other.

'Come on man lets go see her.' I stood swiftly and walked down the hall way and toward Nikolette's room. I had called her parents and let them know that she was in hospital, both of them were freaking out.

Cythanie, Tosh and Shaayne were all on their way to the hospital now. They all felt bad for Nikolette and Shaayne sort of blamed himself for her being in here. It wasn't his fault though, it was mine... if I had jumped into the little brawl and stopped it, and Nikolette would be fine right about now.

'You have to be quiet.' The nurse at the door sighed and opened the door to Nikolette's room.

Nikolette was lying in the bed, with her head facing toward the window. Some light from the streetlights outside was shining on her face. I quietly walked over to her and wrapped my hand over hers.

'How are you feeling?' I whispered and kissed her forehead.

'Sore.' She croaked.

I carefully lent on the bed and held Nikolette's hand until she fell asleep. When her parents arrived they paced back and forth until the doctor came in with the police following closely behind.

They all turned and looked at Ish and they, I all made it seem like it were our fault that Nikolette was in this situation. Well it kind of was, but we weren't the one who stabbed her.

'I would like to talk to her boyfriend first.' the large police man. I nodded and left Nikolette's side and went outside to talk to the police, they made me seem small and inferior... and I didn't like feeling like this.

'Now we want to know what happened. Who did this to her?' the larger officer asked.

I explained everything in detail of what happened and how Mark was starting to go insane. I told them where he lived, which is next door to Nikolette and with that they let me go back inside and they went and asked Ish the same questions. At least I think that they were the same questions.

'Nyk.' Mr. Nixon looked at me with hard eyes.

'Yes sir.' I came to his side and smile nicely at him.

'When did my daughter get a tattoo with your name on it.' He said sternly.

'Um... maybe a week ago.' I suddenly became nervous.

'When Nikolette is better and is allowed to come home... we are going to have a serious talk, young man.' Mr. Nixon put his hands on his hips and looked me directly in the eyes.

'Yes sir... I wouldn't want anything else right now.' I smiled politely and turned my attention back to Nikolette.

Nikolette's POV

It had all but been two days since the whole incident and I was still cringing in pain every time I made my way down the stairs to get a drink... the doctors had given me painkillers to take every time the pain is too unbearable.

Today Nyk was coming over this afternoon, after school. My father wanted to talk to the both of us about something. I was sort of worried but then I thought that Nyk and I could work it out together, because with ever challenge we face our relationship becomes stronger and more stable.

The doorbell rang and brought me out of my thoughts; I walked slowly toward the door to open it to find Nyklus standing behind the door with a large bunch of flowers.

'These are for you... and so is this.' Nyk chuckled softly and held up some books, obviously that was my school work that I wasn't going to do for a while.

'And I missed you to.' I giggled and let Nyk in and planting a soft kiss on his cheek. Nyk walked silently into the kitchen and placed the flowers in a vase. Nyk crossed the small distance that separated us and wrapped his arms around my waist carefully, to make sure that he didn't cause me any pain. I stared into Nyk's eyes; I quickly became captivated and was lost in his dark brown eyes.

Someone cleared their throat behind us, and both of us turned to see my father standing behind us with his arms crossed across his chest. He was looking at as very seriously, but look was soon lost when I smiled at him.

'Come sit down.' My father gestured to the table to the side of us.

Chapter 17

Nyklus POV

'Come sit down.' Nikolette's father gestured to the table in the kitchen. I took in a large breath of air, I was scared, I didn't know what to expect.

I took Nikolette's hand in mine and sat down at the table, looking into his ice blue eyes that sent shivers down my spine.

'Now Nyklus, I want to know what you attentions with my daughter are.' Mr. Nixon looked down at me with ice-cold eyes.

'Attentions sir...' I gulped. What happens if I say the wrong thing?

'Yes attentions.' His eyes narrowed.

'Well sir, I love your daughter very much and I don't see a day in my future with out her. I would be honored if you would give me your blessings to ask your daughter's hand in marriage.' Wow... I just sounded like Edward Cullen, old fashioned much.

'Hand in marriage...' Mr. Nixon laughed at me.

'Yes sir... I want to marry Nikolette.' I smiled and looked over at the girl I loved.

Nikolette's POV

He wants to marry me! Marry me.

'Well, I'm happy you asked because with that tattoo on her hip I was going to demand that you marry

her.' my father laughed.

'Really!' I looked at my father with shock.

'Sweetie, I seen now that the two of you are inseparable. Nyklus proved himself when he saved you from the son of the devil, Mark.'

No one has mentioned anything about Mark since I left the hospital, I don't even know if he is in jail. I don't know if they are even holding a court hearing, but I guess I don't really care that much as long as he stays well and truly far away from me.

'Thank you daddy.' I shrieked and went to move to fast for my sore body.

'Just make sure you take care of her.' my father held out his hand toward Nyk, who smiled and took it in his.

'I will.' Nyk nodded and continued to smile.

Mark's POV

I will get that dick... for what he did to me. I lost everything.

My love...

My family...

My freedom...

He will pay... Nyklus will pay. When I get out of this cell I will go after all of them one by one and then I will force Nikolette to love me.

"No matter what you do, she will never love you." the voice in my head called out to me.

'She will love me... she will see how wrong she was to leave me.' I said out loud, my voice echoing off the gray cement walls.

\-----Several days later----

Nikolette's POV

I'm finally aloud to go to school, after having almost three weeks off from school. It was good to be able to get out of the house.

The smell of fresh flowers in bloom filled my lungs, as I walked along side of Nyk, Ish and Cythanie toward our spot underneath the tree that over looked the sports ovals.

Tosh and Shaayne were already seated and sucking each others faces off. God I had missed school.

I felt as everything was back to normal.

I smiled up at Nyk as I sat incased in his arms.

'I love you.' I whispered and closed my eyes. I was excited for the future... the one I was going to have with Nyk.

Chapter 18

Nikolette's POV

I sniveled and wiped my eyes, clearing them from any tears that blurred my vision.

I had been crying ever since I got home this afternoon. I was hated... everyone except for my click and a few other kids hated me...

What for?

Mark!

They blamed me for their star player being in jail and most probably being kept there for longer than a year.

"He brought it upon himself." Nyk said when the first hate letter found its way into my locker.

I tried very had not to let the letter get to me, but it didn't work too well. Especially after the Pop's made it very clear that I was on their hit list.

Shake showers, food cannons, flushing swirls and every other terrible thing the Pop's did to people they hated... that wasn't really what scared me the most about the Pop's threat... it was the thought that they would think of something worse to do to me.

A small sob escaped my chest as I looked up from my bedroom floor. My eyes stained blood red from the tears that still caressed my checks, I was hurting inside and out.

My stomach covered in stitches, caused me more pain as I stood from my seated position on the bed to a standing one.

I whinnied instantly and crumbled over in a large heap. My fall could be heard throughout the whole house.

I let out a large huff and tried to get off the floor to only fall back down, my hand slowly fluttered to my stomach to feel the warm sticky sensation caused by my own blood.

I had ripped my stitches open.

Tears filled my eyes once more, when I realized that I couldn't move without causing myself more pain and the fact that no one was home and wouldn't be home for another hour or so.

I looked up to my bedside table... my phone sitting on the edge just out of reach.

Right now I needed a miracle.

Nyklus' POV

Something felt wrong and out of place as I looked around my room for the source.

'Maybe it's not in your room.' A small voice called in my mind.

A frown crossed my face as I looked over at the clock on my bedside table.

Five-thirty...

I think I might and go and see if Nikolette.

I looked up at her house ten minutes later. It seemed quite inside and out, where was Nikolette she was meant to be at home all afternoon.

I sighed and walked up to the door and rung the doorbell.

No response

That was weird, maybe she went for a walk. I pulled out my phone and hit the speed dial.

"You have reached Nikolette's phone... obviously I'm not here so leave a message." Her voice sounded sweet and soft.

Where was she?

'Try her parents.' A voice in my head called. I nodded to my self and dialed in her father's number.

'Hello?' her father's voice called down the phone.

'Hi... Mr. Nixon... its Nyk...have you seen Nikolette?' I asked her father nicely.

'She is meant to be at home.' He said calmly.

'Well she isn't answering the door and everything is locked up.' I said softly, as I was quickly consumed by fear... what happens if Mark escaped from the prison and has got her?

'I will be there soon.' Mr. Nixon quickly said, also becoming consumed with fear for Nikolette's safety.

Chapter 19

Nyklus's POV

Mr. Nixon showed up several minutes later. He ran out of his BMW Series 5 and ran up the front steps where I was waiting impatiently.

'Have you tried her phone?' Mr. Nixon asked while opening the front door.

'Yes... she didn't answer.' When he finally unlocked the front door I pushed my way through and ran upstairs, to Nikolette's room, where I found her in a heap, blood seeping from the wound on her stomach.

'Nik... oh Nik...' I lifted her into my arms and held her gently.

'Call an ambulance.' I screamed out to Nikolette's father. After five minutes, Nikolette's father entered her room and fell to the floor next to his daughter. She was out cold, probably from blood loss.

'Please step away from the girl... we need to get her in the ambulance.' One of the paramedics said softly taking Nikolette's body away from mine.

'Please... sir I need to go with her.' I said looking at Nikolette's father, who smiled weakly and nodded.

'Thank you...' I said softy and walked past him, following the paramedics to the ambulance and climbing in next to Nikolette's still form.

I should have gotten here sooner; if I did she wouldn't be unconscious right now.

Nikolette's POV

My eyelids slowly fluttered open, revealing a large white room. What happened to me?

My stitches... I accidentally ripped them. I must have died then, no room on earth is this white.

I tried to sit up on the soft comfy bed, but a warm hand pushed me back down gently. I looked up to see who the hand belonged to and found Nyk looking down at me with tender eyes, I couldn't help but smile up at him as I relaxed back down on the pillow.

'Am I in heaven.' I whispered.

Nyk laughed next to me and softly kissed me on the lips, as if I were breakable.

'No... you're still on earth with me.' Nyk whispered in return and placed his hand in mine.

'What's the time?' I asked looking around the room for a clock.

'Four thirty...' Nyk smiled.

'So I was only out for half an hour.' I said with a sigh of relief.

'Not exactly... more like twenty-four hours.' I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling a warm and gentle hand caress my cheek.

'I was so worried about you... the doctor said you lost a lot of blood.'

'I'm sorry I will be more careful next time.' I opened my eyes again and took in the small vase of black roses next to my bed.

'Its from the click... they said get better soon.'

'I guess I'm going to miss out on some more school.' I sighed. I loved school, there was no other place on earth where you have lunch and recess, then spend all day hanging out with your friends.

'Sorry sweetie but it's the doctor's orders.' My dad stepped into the room and smiled at me.

'Okay...' I huffed and closed my eyes once more to be consumed by darkness. Being in the dark wasn't so bad; it brings back memories and happy times. Like when you're with your friends, it was as if the darkness understood you and wanted to help you by locking away any fear you might have.

Nyklus's Pov

I sat in the quite hospital room and waited for the next time that Nikolette would wake, when that would be I don't know. I was really worried for her safety, on the news this morning they said that Mark had escaped from prison. I knew instantly who he was coming for, Nik. She was defenseless while she was in hospital and I couldn't leave her like that.

Mark's POV

I know she is in there, I heard from a reliable source that she ripped open her stitches and have to stay in hospital for a while.

Looking in the car park I notice Nyklus' car parked near her fathers. I have all the time in the world right now, I can wait to get her and make her mine. Then we will see whom Nikolette loves more, him or me. I will have my revenge on Nyklus, no one takes anything away from me and goes un punished... he will pay.

A large smirk formed on my lips as I stepped back into the shadows of the bushes.

"She will be ours." The voice in my head told me as we waited in silence. Eventually Nyk and Nikolette's father will have to go home and when they do Nikolette will be mine.

Scene Kidz 20

Mark's Pov

This plan is perfect. I won't even waste my time on Nyklus. I'll just wait until Nyklus and my beloveds' dad leaves then I will rescue my beautiful Nikolette.

\---

**lylaBITEZx** : _I bet your wondering why Mark harassed Cythanie a couple of chapters back. Well there are answers to everything right?_

\---

Mark's Pov Ch 3

I was walking down the halls when I noticed Cythanie at her at her locker dancing. I know that my heart belongs for Nikolette but... in a way Cythanie is more mature and older than Nik, she'll understand that this will just be a fling. I'll spend the rest of my life catering to Nikolette. With that I made my way over to Cythanie.

She was more developed than Nik is. But Nik is perfect for me. I loved Nik with every thing I had. That's why I had to do this. I have to get all my urges out, before I hurt Nikolette by cheating on her.

As I approached Cythanie I heard her listening to a Nicki Minaj song.

\---

**lylaBITEZx** : _yada yada yada, we all no what happens._

\---

Nikolette's Pov [present]

"Nyk, baby, go home, get some sleep, take a freaking shower! I'll be here when you get back, where am I going to go? You too dad. I'll be alright; he can't get me anymore right? He's locked up. Hopefully forever." I said to Nyklus and my dad. They shared a look before nodding their heads slowly. We said our goodbyes and they left. I fell asleep instantly.

\-----

I heard shuffling movements from behind my eyelids, but I couldn't open them! I felt like someone drugged me.

"Wha-what's goin' on?!" My voice was still groggy from sleep.

"SH-sh, baby. I'm getting you out of here. So we can finally be together." That voice wasn't Nyk's, my dad's, a doctor's, or any of the guys. It. Was. Mark's. *scream*

That was my last coherent thought before I passed out.

Nyklus' Pov

"What do you mean she's gone?!" I shrieked to the other line of my cell.

"Well... one of the doctors went in to check on her and she was missing. We checked security cameras outside the door and we saw that she was being carried by that man who escaped from jail. Marcus Peterson?"

"Mark." I said harshly. This was the last time he will take her from me!

Nikolette's Pov

My eyes were still to the point where I couldn't open them. I could feel we were in a car.

"Mark why are you doing this? How did you ever get out of jail"? I asked as I felt the car pull over.

"What do you mean 'why are you doing this?'? I love you and I am doing this for us. And as to how I'm out of jail... I might've killed a guard or two." I could tell he had a sadistic smile on his face.

"Where are we?" I could finally open my eyes; we were in a parking lot.

"We're at a hotel, darlin'" he said with an evil smirk. My eyes widened in fear.

Mark's Pov

I had to tell the concierge that we were engaged. Which we most likely will be. I carried my angel to the elevator and then to our suite. The honey moon one. I smirked. This would be good practice.

I laid Nikolette down on the bed and hovered over her.

"What are you doing?" Her angelic voice spoke.

"I'm about to make love to you. What does it look like?"

"No, please. DON'T." she cried. I bet Nyklus beat her. That's why she's refusing me. She's afraid of him, yeah that's it.

"C'mon Nik, just give me this one time and I'll leave you alone forever." I lied; I was never giving her up. Once she realizes how good I make her feel she'll never want to leave me, plus this way if Nyklus finds out I can say it wasn't rape because Nikolette didn't say no.

Nikolette's Pov

I looked him in the eyes to make sure he was lying. He looked sincere.

"Will you leave my friends alone too? I don't know about this."

"Yeah I'll leave them alone too. I'll run away, never come back."

God Nyklus is going to hate me for this, but I'm only doing this so Mark will finally leave us alone. That's all I want, and if this is my only way to get peace, then I guess this is the only way.

I reluctantly nodded my head. Mark had a full blown smile on his face.

God help me.

Nyklus' Pov

The plan was set. Mark stupidly used his credit card to rent a hotel room. It was only a matter of time.

Mark's Pov

I woke up to the hotel room's phone ringing. Nikolette was in the shower I guess.

"Hello?"

"Sir there has been a problem with your card. Can you come down here so we could clear it up?" the concierge said.

"Yeah of course, I'll be right down."

I took one last look to the bathroom before I went down to the lobby, and smirked. Nikolette wasn't going anywhere.

\---------

I walked over to the concierges' desk in the lobby. The concierge had his back to me.

"I was called down here?" I asked.

"Well, well, well. You must have some pretty big balls to kidnap my fiancée again! You didn't I'd give up did you?" he turned around holding a voice changer to his mouth, Nyklus-- damn.

"Hello, mark." He said with out the changer.

"WHY! Why must you ruin everything? Me and Nikolette could've finally been together, and have a life of our own. She doesn't want you. As soon as we entered the hotel room she jumped me and told me she wanted me. She was glad I took her. Give up already. You lost" I said wanting him to disappear.

"You're lying, she does love me. You're crazy. She would never want a psychotic moron like you. You give up mark. GIVE UP!"

"Your really getting on my nerves little boy I bout I just end you now." I said as I pulled my gun out of my waist band.

Nyklus' Pov

He was out of his mind. If he touched her...

The police were waiting for my signal. I had to make sure Nik was okay before anything happened to Mark. If she was hurt I would kill him.

As soon as mark raised his gun the police fired into him be fore he could cause any damage. As he dropped to the ground I heard my girl shriek.

Nikolette's Pov

When I stepped out the bathroom dressed Mark was nowhere to be found. I took this as my chance to escape. I quickly ran toward the elevator.

Once I made it to the lobby I watched as Mark was killed. There was a lot of blood. I shrieked. I looked around the room until my eyes found Nyk's. I ran over to arms.

"It's all over baby, it's all over." He whispered in my ear.

Scene Kidz Chapter 21

Screaming out in pain, I held on the Nyk for dear life. What could I say I was in pain, there was nothing anyone could do to subside it, except for holding me and telling me that everything was going to be okay.

It has all but been eight months and two weeks since Mark was killed, freeing me from his terror. The only reminder of the pain was the baby that was ready to be delivered. My father had offered to pay to have what he called a monster removed, however my motherly instincts kicked in, causing me to defend my unborn child.

Nyk had stuck by me through my decision out of love and I was grateful to him, having someone stick by me through the thick and thin. As months passed and the new baby experiences occurred, Nyk found himself getting more and more excited to be a father. Even thought he understood that the child would never full be his, but Nyk will love the child never the less.

The nurses hurried me down the corridors on my hospital bed, Nyk holding onto my hand as he ran beside me. I was scared to be giving birth to a child, like so many new mums before me, But Nyk made me a promise and plans on sticking to it. He was going to be there every step of the way.

Whipping my forehead, I watched and panted as the hospital rooms past me by causing flashes of memories of people marking me as a whore. A teenage mother was another name people called me other than slut, at first I admit I was hurt however they did not know my story and most likely never will. My story wasn't always happy, but as long as I have Nyk by my side and my family and friends there to support me, I will have the happy ending that no one else could have.

'Come on sweetie you have to push.' Nyk encouraged whipping away my sweat and tears. Stepping into my view my doctor looked down at me with happiness, he was one of the few that knew whose child I bored.

The pain never seemed to subside as I screamed in agony, while seconds turned into minutes and minutes into hours. Looking up at Nyk as I gave one last hard push, we screamed together. This was our moment of glory our moment of joy, as we listened to the cries of our new child.

Handing the baby to Nyk, I watched in happiness as he held the child so gently that anyone thought it could break with the slightest jolt.

'Your baby looks healthy.' The doctor said, while Nyk handed me my pride and joy. Looking down at the baby, it had my blue eyes but Mark's black hair. Nether the less the baby was beautiful. I was so happy at this very moment and nothing could seem to change it.

What are we going to call or new baby...

### The End?
