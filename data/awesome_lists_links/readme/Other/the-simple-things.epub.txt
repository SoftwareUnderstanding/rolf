PROLOGUE:

"I can't love anymore. You are the only person who changed me. Who turned me into an angel from being bad" I run my thumb across her cheek going to her lips.

"But..."

"Maybe this affair is wrong. But I want you to know..." I took the hardest breathe in my whole life. "Loving you was the best thing that I do." I whispered I closed my eyes and I gently kissed her soft lips. I will soon miss her lips. When we kissed the stars above was gone. And the rain poured silently.

### The Simple Things

By John Cabales

### Chapter One: LIFE

I heard the alarm of the clock beside me. This always disturbs my dreams. I grabbed the clock and I can see the time though it was blurred in my eyes.

6:00am.

I still feel the tiredness of my body so I decide to kill the freak kind of music from my alarm clock. I clicked the OFF button and I just quickly fall asleep again. But a few moments later, there was a voice trying to wake me up from this beautiful dream of mine. The voice was like the alarm of my clock every morning. Freak.Full of irritation. When I opened my eyes, it was Louisa. My Grandma.

"Do you want to sleep forever?" says she. I admit that because of her freak voice I've got a lot of Punctuality awards in school. I am now in my last year of my high school life.

"Mamoo, I'm so tired. I wanna sleep, okay?" Mamoo. That is how I call her.

"Tired?"

"Yes." I answered.

"Did you go out last night? Did you?"

"Uhhh..." I cannot think of any lies anymore whether it's black or white. I have no more things to discuss. Because I know she don't wanted any explanations. And all I can think is to laugh in front of her.

"I see...but I don't care if you did 'cause today you need to go to the resort to assist every people who enjoys and spend their vacations there." Her right brow rises every time she speaks.

"Why should I?" I ask innocently.

"Your father calls me a while ago. He wants you there."

"But Mamoo..."

"No more buts. Get a shower and dress yourself up! Alright?"

"Alright." I said with disagreement.

I took my shower for 20 minutes. I opened my wardrobe and clothes were hung in line. These clothes are too much expensive. All of these clothes are approximately in a million dollars in total. I choose to wear a red shirt with a checkered style collar. When I'm totally dressed I look myself into the mirror. All I can see is I. The handsome and beautiful playboy. With his hair in dyed with dark bloody red.

I am myself.

I am August Coin.

I am a business man's son.

More of my classmates are envious with me. Because all of the things that I want is all mine. But they are wrong. Definitely wrong. I want to tell you that my life is not perfect as what other people says.

My mother left me when I was a 3 months old. She filed a divorced with my father and remarried to a simple and uneducated man. I am now sixteen. And I never saw her in my whole life. Even in a picture. I don't know anything about her. All I know is her beautiful name. Stephanie.

I have a father. He is George Coin. But he's nowhere to be found because of his business. I have him but I never feel his presence. It's like I don't have a father at all. There are no comparisons about it. He's home once a month. He didn't care about me. I'm bright somehow but I do not have any reasons to aim an 85% above grades because of him.

I remember when I became an honor student in fourth grade, I was the second from the class and I have been waiting for George (my sense can't resist calling him DAD) in school for the awarding of medals. I am full of expectation that he will come but when the time that my name was called by Mrs. Pasugnod, my favorite Science teacher; I walked into the stage without him. I walked alone. Mamoo was sick that time. I'm so jealous with my classmates taking photographs as a remembrance. Their parents are so proud of them. And I? I am in a hiding in a corner, cying.

I promised that I'll never gonna be an honor student again. What for? It's no use.

When I had finished my breakfast, Mamoo called Joe, our driver to ready the car for he will be driving me to the resort. But I refuse.

"Mamoo, it's okay. I can drive the car for myself."

She took a deep breath.

"It's better to be safe than cure, August." She said meticulously.

I can do no more things but to follow her.

We're on the way going to the resort. I feel a little boredom. I know Joe is getting angry with me because of the too much loudness volume of the music I'm playing inside the car. I can see the smiling sun in a blue sky through the rear view mirror. A moment later, I see a billboard. It's the resorts.

"We're here!" Joe says after hitting the break.

WELCOME TO FORESTLAND RESORT

The words are perfectly carved in a foreign wood above the entrance gate. I opened the door of the car and I get down. People watched me like a superstar. I stood as high as I can. Joe parked the car in a space lot.

"Good morning Mr. Coin" Mr. Ben greeted me. He's our entrance guard by the way.

"Well, George wants me here"

"You?"

"Yeah. He wants me to deal with the strangers."

He laughed when I say it.

"Good luck, Mr. Coin" He said.

Employees greet me as I pass by.

I went inside the Light House. It's our own personal rest house. WOW is the best word to describe the interior designs of our rest house. The ceilings, the wall colors, the chimney, the fool, the theme. Everything is perfect in this house. Every month, George spent two to five million dollars to change the design our rest house though were staying here for a few hours only. Especially George.

I went into his table and had nothing to find. I sat on the couch for a while looking around. Then I went to an open window. I can see beautiful things.

I went outside.

I sat on a bench that is made up of foreign wood like the one located at the entrance. When people pass by I greeted them Good Morning and saying "Welcome to forestland resort!" over and over again to every single person coming. I'm sure they think I am crazy.

My phone vibrates inside my pocket. Francis is calling.

"Hey!" I said over the phone.

"Where are you? Today is my birthday. All of us were already here except you."

I forgot that it's his birthday today.

"Oh...I'm so sorry. I can't be with the group today. George sent me in the resort. By the way happy birthday! See you all soon!" I put down the phone.

A moment later, sleepiness is attacking me again. I went to the lighthouse and slept fot the mean time.

When I'm awake, I feel the heat of the burning sun outside striking my face through the open window. I looked at my watch. It's already one in the afternoon. And I didn't still have my lunch. I went to the open window to exhale some fresh air. My eyes became so wide when I notice something happening in the pool. My sleepiness had gone so fast.

I briskly went to the pool where the drowning kid is. There's no one in that pool except for that little kid. I jumped into the pool and saved the kid. Because of that kid I swam still wearing my clothes.

Mr. Ben, the guard came and helps us.

I saw a girl running toward us. I guess she's the sister of this kid. I saved.

"Micheal!" She scream. "Is he alright?"

"He'll be alright girl, don't you worry." Mr. Ben said.

I know she's too worried about what had happen to her little brother.

And I? I'm too worried too. But not to the kid. I'm worried about myself. What clothes I'll be wearing now? I didn't brought extra shirts. I'm not expecting this to happen. Not really!

I took a shower in the bathroom of our rest house. I'm only wearing a white towel to cover my whole naked body while waiting for my clothes to dry. A few minutes later, there's a knock in the door. I opened it. A waiter greeted me hello and placed my lunch on the table.

It's five in the afternoon. I checked my clothes and hopefully, they are dried already. I wore them.

After my dinner, I found a bench outside and there I sat. I take a look at the brilliance of the last quarter moon. It's smiling. And also the spark of the stars forming like half of a heart. While I watched it, I fell asleep.

Chapter Two: THE TRANSFEREE GIRL

I hear the alarm of my clock again. I want to sleep but not this time anymore. It's time to go to school. I jump off of the bed and went into the bathroom to shower myself. When I'm finished, I wore my irritating uniform again.

Mamoo cooked me a delicious breakfast and after I'm finish eating I kissed her goodbye.

"August, always take care of yourself"

That's always her words for me before I'm leaving the house. I just simply give her a warm and lovely smile.

Thanks God! I am free again!

I can only do whatever I like when I'm in school. With my friends, I will be bored less. My day is totally uncompleted without being with them. We always hang out after class. Never minding if we have exams or any homework's to be done.

When I arrived there is no student in the campus. Except me. I realized that I was too early for school today. A sort of excitement perhaps. I just laughed with myself and sat on a porch and I wait for the guard.

A few minutes had passed by, the school guard arrived in.

"Oh, you are too early huh."

"yeah."

A few seconds, I saw Francis in a taxi. He paused and pays the taxi driver. So cheap, I think. But I cannot blame him because he's not rich to buy an expensive cars.

"Oh, you're punctual for this year's first class!" He said.

"Yeah. Always I" I said.

"So how's your visit in the resort?"

"I just sat there, you know. I welcome people. And saved a poor drowning kid."

"Haha! That's great!" He laughed. "And it's awful I think 'cause you'd never came with us." He added.

"Exactlt it is. By the way, Happy birthday to you!!" I greeted him.

"Thanks."

Finally Brett, Tiffany, James, Carmeo, Jon, and Emy arrived. We are noe complete!

Before anything else, I would like to introduce them to you.

Brett Claffin.

He's a vocalist, guitarist, drummer, and a pianist as well. He really loves music. He wants to be with his girlfriend Tiffany all the time.

Tiffany Cristianne.

A sexy, white complexion, like her boyfriend Brett she can also sing.

James Conne.

He's a teacher's lone son. He's one of the honor student in our class and I think he's pursuing to be valedictorian this year.

Carmelo Parker.

The boyish girl. She's beautiful but we really don't know why she's acting like a boy. She wants us to call her "Carmeo".

Jon Eric.

He's the quite one. He's "Hush". He's also running for valedictorian. He's a product of a broken family and now he is living alone on his condominium unit he bought.

EmyRuie.

A holy girl who loves reading bible.

When I'm out in this school, I will never forget them. Friendship makes prosperity more brilliant, and lightens adversity.

Noise filled the empty classroom again. We're waiting for Mrs. Nille, our teacher in Biology. My classmates are chitchatting like they were not seeing each other for a hundred years. Talking some issues, talking about their boyfriends/girlfriends, Talking for their new phones, Talking fashions talking about their vacations, Talking everything, and I know they were also talking to me.

"The girls there are talking to you August." Says Francis

"Yeah, I noticed, too" Said James.

"So?" I said. "It's not new. You knew that I'm so popular in this school. People here normally talks about me". I added.

Carmeo breathe deeply. "I guess so..." She said in the corner, white talking with Sophia. Her crush.

A moment later, Mrs. Nille came carrying her biology and Science books. We noticed that she changed she's not wearing an eyeglasses any more.

Her lip is now a thick-red than before. She looks beautiful in her way. Her hair was also fully relaxed and bouncing straight. She looks young by the way. Maybe that is her new year's resolution. She sat down on the teacher's table and laid the books in the table.

"Good morning seniors!" She said.

"Good Morning Mrs. Nille" We said back together.

"How's your vacation?"

The Whole class is now in the chorus answering her.

"It's Fine."

"It's awful!"

"That was my unforgettable vacation."

"I love this vacation so much because we're gone to New York City"

"We tour around the world too"

"I'm not satisfied with the vacation."

"I was sick!"

I hear my classmate notions. And it's irritating in my ear so I just put my hands in my ear and press it harder and harder as I can so that I cannot hear the awful noise anymore. Francis is laughing at me Tiffany and Brett, too.

"Well vacation is over everything's back to normal." Mrs. Nille said.

Everybody sighed.

"But today, since this is our first meeting for this year. I wanted to know your new year's resolutions." Mrs. Nille added.

She begins calling names and when mine was called she stare gently at me.

"Mr. Coin, Mr. Coin, Mr. Coin." She said repeatedly. "What's your new year's resolution?"

I stood quietly and breathe slowly.

"I'll break my relationship with my girlfriends".

"I hope you do"

"Yeah, I did"

Everyone in the classroom became hush.

In the middle of silence, Mr. Ross the school principal knocked on the door. I can see a strange girl in uniform. Her books are in her hands. Mrs. Nille excuse on us and left us a while as she talks to Mr. Ross.

Mrs. Nilleget in with the girl. She's beautiful and I'm not lying. But there's something on this girl. She looks strange familiar into me. Really. Mrs. Nille introduced the girl in front of us.

"Everyone I guess we have a new student. A transferee."Said she.

"Come on and introduce yourself." Mrs. Nille Whispered on her.

"Hi! I'm Yhanna Rose" Her lips is pink and now she's having a dazzling smile. Her voice is sweet. Her eyes are gold as mine. And I don't know what to say. I don't know what adjective perfectly describes this girl. But I don't like her anyway.

"Hi Yhanna!" Everyone greeted her. I was losing my mind that moment.

"Ms. Rose, you seat beside Mr. Coin." Mrs. Nille Commanded.

"But..." I quick object but Mrs. Nille Cut my words.

"What Mr. Coin?"

I can't do anything else.

"Nothing." I breathe hard.

Yhanna Rose sat beside me and gently smiles at me. I gave her a little smile, too.

Chapter Three: RED PIECE OF PAPER

Miss swift our P.E teacher entered the classroom. She has a blonde curly hair. Always wearing an eyeglass. She is the only P.E teacher in our school. She is beautiful and teenage guys adore her always. She's not married. She doesn't have any boyfriend. In other words a maiden.

She sat on the teacher's table and laid her things on the top of the desk and say hello to us. She's never been bad to us.

"Hello everyone. How's your Wednesday" she always starts her class asking us how's our day.

Everyone in the class say "Fine."

"We have our new lesson." She said. She took a chalk from the drawer found under the teacher's table and wrote on the board.

DANCE.

I feel the drop of my sweat, falling. I hate dance I hate it. Usually I'm not listening to the topics that I'm not interested.

"Okay. Who can tell me the definition of "DANCE"?"

No one raise their hands. Except for my seat mate Yhanna.

"Yes Ms. Rose?"

Yhanna stood silently and the small noise has been shattered and gone.

"Dance... is a type of art that generally involves movement of the body."

"Very good Ms. Rose, you can have your seat."

Yhanna look at me for a seconds and I just turn my sight against her. I don't like the moment our eyes met.

Miss Swift wrote on the board again. And I know what that is different kinds of dance. Ballet taps, Rumba, Jazz, Jive, Lyrical, Lindy hop, Modern Polka, Tango Theater, Hip-Hop, Ballroom, African Folk, Contemporary Samba square, Waltz, Foxtrot, Cha-Cha-Cha, and Salsa.

"Now, I want you to find a partner for this."

Oh? I knew what she talks about. We will be dancing. Oh lord! Help me! I don't want to be involved in this.

Please, let me out of it.

For a moment, everyone's busy for finding their partners. I am just sitting in my seat like there's nothing. I don't want to find a partner. I'm not joining, I'm not interested. But suddenly, I saw Yhanna in her seat just like me. Just sitting beside me like there's nothing else happening around us.

I can't take my eyes of her. I don't know why. A few minutes of staring at her, she caught my eye. And she gave me a little grin.

"Partner?" She said. There's no person.

I realized for a moment in time Yhanna Rose is talking to me. And she wanted me to be her partner.

"Sure" I said hushly.

No! I should have said no. I am not interested for these dances to perform or anything. I didn't know why that word splits out of my mouth. I think my tongue has a problem.

"I think everyone has a partner." Miss Swift said.

I can see a small piece of papers in fold, papers in different colors.

"Every pair should pick up one."

We did.

I let Yhanna Rose to pick up one. She chooses the red paper in fold. I don't know why she chooses that color. Maybe it's her favorite color.so Am I.

"Now everyone let's open it together!" she clapped her hands twice.

When Yhanna opened it, I saw: BALLROOM. Printed in adobe Garamond Pro font I think.

"You are required to perform what had you picked. You need to perform it well, perfect as you can!. Because I am not giving an examination anymore, this is now your exam I want you to perform it on Friday next week. So good luck." Miss Swift quickly grabbed her things on the table and said her goodbye.

Ballroom.

I'd seen this dance already. Because Mammoo and Pammoo, my grandpa is dancing this in their anniversaries before Pammoo passed away. I know this dance but I am still not interested to it.

FRIDAY

After our class in the afternoon ends, Yhanna asked me when well lets practice our dance performance. It's only seven days left before the performance. And I don't care about it.

"Uhhh... maybe tomorrow or Sunday I think" I said

"Well, I think it's better if we do practice now."

"No. I am busy by now. Tomorrow perhaps."

"Alright"

"Ahmmmn... Where?" I asked her.

"Maybe in the house if you don't mind?"

"Fine, no problem" I said with a smile.

She gave me their home address and left me.

"Take Care!" she said lastly and walked away.

As I walk into my car I saw Francis.

"Hey" he greeted me.

"Hello!" I Said.

"I think you are falling" He opened the door of my car and put his things inside.

Falling?" I don't know what he wants to emphasized.

"Yeah" He said.

We get inside of my car and suddenly before the engine are on. I knew what he meant.

"No!" I said in my high gentle pitch voice.

"Really huh? He laughed at me while I drive the car.

"Yes!"

I don't know what kind of food did he ate on his launch. "Yhanna Rose is a beautiful. I know there's a growing population of the senior boys in school adoring her. But she is not the one that I would fall. She's not the kind of girl I want to say August". He laughed at me "if you really don't have feelings for Yhanna Rose you know how to prove it. "I know what my best friend mean. Like what I did to my girls. I will make her my girlfriend and then break her. In other words hurt her. I'm good at that, I think I was born to hurt every girls feelings. I was born to break their hearts. Because my mother also breaks me.

It's already 10 in the evening and I still cannot sleep. My ears hurt because of my headphones. Because of the rock music I'm playing, I think my window is still widely open. I can see the moon shinning bright and a moment later I saw Yhanna Rose in the moon. The beautiful YhannaRose, and I never knew that I already whispered her name over my pillow. Then I've hear a knocked on my door. I knew it'sMammoo.

"August?" said she on the other side of the door.

"Come in, Mammoo. The door is open". I welcome her.

Mammoo entered my room w/ a glass of milk. She sat on my bed.

"Why you're still awake?" she asked.

"Maybe I'm suffering insomnia".

"I'd brought you a glass of milk". She put it on my table. Beside the dimming lampshade.

"Thank you. How did you know that I'm still awake, Mammoo?" I asked her.

"The music you're playing over your headphones are too loud. It makes me feel like I'm suffering an insomnia too"

"I'm sorry, Mammoo" I apologized to her.

She turned her gaze over the lampshade. And I hear the word she whispered "BALLROOM".

She saw the red paper with signs of line folds near the side of the lampshade where she put the glass of milk, she handed the red piece of paper.

"What's this?" she asked me.

"It's our examination performance in P.E" I said.

"Oh? I'm good at this. I can teach you".

"Mammoo..." I Muffled.

"What?"

I stayed in silence.

"By the way who's your partner?"

"A transferee." I rolled my eyes. She saw it.

"Is she beautiful?"

"Mammoo... please I want to sleep now I have a practice for that kind of dance tomorrow."

"Uhh... I think it's a better idea if I will be your ballroom mentor, if you don't mind."

"Ah...Maybe, I think next time!"

SATURDAY

After my lunch I drove to Yhanna's house it's not really far from the school. I parked my car into a space lot. Their house is not so big. It is only made up of wood. I found a garden in front of their house. I can smell the sweet scent of myrtles. I guess she loves myrtle. Then I'm in the door way, I knocked. A woman opened the door. I think she's Yhanna's mother. Like her, beautiful, she has a golden blonde hair her eyes are like mine and I feel something strange familiar.

"You are August, right?" She asked me.

"Oh Yeah. I am."

Just a few seconds Yhanna entered the conversation.

"Hey! You're here!" She said over me.

"Mom, this is August. And August this is my mom Annie"

Her mom gave me a smile. We shake hands together. And I feel a strange familiar feeling again. But I ignore it.

Yhanna and I were sitting on their table. Annie served us a combination of strawberry and apple juice. I take a sip to taste what's the flavor of the juice and to tell you, I liked it.

"My father is working in the farm. He's always home late at night" Yhanna Said.

I don't care.I think.

Suddenly a kid appeared. He's familiar to me I already saw him. But I don't know where, Yhanna too.

"This is my little brother Michael." She said, but I don't care. And I don't want to know a lot of things. I am here to practice the ballroom dance. I think I am wasting my time with this girl.

Chapter Four: GRATITUDE

We had our first day of practice in Yhanna's garden. Near the space lot where my car is parked. Different scents of flowers are all that breathe. I can see her mother looking on us.

I am holding Yhanna's warm hands. But she took it off quickly. And her arms are now hanging in my shoulder. While mine were on her hips. I feel this awkwardness to a girl I don't like and I would not.

"Why?" she said and looked at me.

I feel some heat behind my ears. "What?"

"Your checks were turning red"

I feel so obvious. Really. Why I am red! "Ah..maybe because of the heat of the sun ."

I shrugged.

"I see."

Her eyes turned into a direction where her mother was standing. Looking on us and she turned back her sights on me again while me still dancing. In the middle of the garden.

"I think you're mom would like to help us about this thing" I caught the scent of myrtle. It's sweet. She shook her head "She don't dance" She whispered.

"Why?"

"I don't know. Maybe she doesn't find it interesting as you do."

We laughed for a moment.

"Maybe someone should perfectly teach us about this." She said when she already notices that we're dancing the few steps again and again.

In the back of my mind there's only one person who know's ballroom in heart. It's Mammoo.

SUNDAY

In the morning, Yhanna and I went to church together. I don't want to go to church but she pleased me and begged me. And I can't tell a lie anymore. My tongue is tied up. Yhanna brought her little brother. Her mother got sick so she didn't had herself with us to pray. After the mass I drove them home with my car. When we are arrived in their house she thanked me.

"Thank you for driving us home, August."

She thanked me. Holding her little brother's palm.

"You're welcome, Yhanna" I smile and I get inside the car. Micheal is already inside their house but she still remains standing watching me over through an open window of my car. I looked at her. I see her lips smiling.

"I'll pick you up in the afternoon for our practice" I said.

"Okay. See you soon and take care!" she replied over the open window.

When I open the door of our house I scented a sweet smell of chocolate cake. I went into the kitchen and saw Mammoo baking a chocolate cake. My mouth starts to salivated. And I feel hunger.

"Mammoo, I'm hungry. Can I have one?"

"No way, August this is for the visitor" She said in a low and sweet voice.

"Visitor?" I think for a while.

"Yeah, like what you have said your partner will be here. I just like to serve a very delicious and unforgettable taste of sweetness of my inventories". She meant her chocolate cake.

Oh? I almost forget. Yhanna will be here and I am the one who will pick her.

I commanded Joe to pick Yhanna on their house but Mammo insist on me.

"No! you should be the one to pick her from their house".

"But Mammoo, I'm tired."

"You're not tired, I know you're not, you are only lazy little man. Don't you?"

"Okay for you Mammoo." Period.

As I drive going to Yhanna's house I wonder why it is too hot now. It should be cold it should be rain. January. Yes it is but I can imagine that it's March.

And it's summer when I arrived, I parked my car in front of their house. I walked going to the door and I knocked. Her mother opened the door.

"Hi August, I'm glad to see you. Wait I'll call Yhanna"

She left the door open. As I remain standing for about a minute, Yhanna is in front of me now. She is so innocent in her purple dress. Though it is simple, she's not wearing any make up or anything else to make herself attractive and beautiful. Hair is naturally black, lips as innocent as her porcelain skin. She is simple and I can tell you every simple thing makes you beautiful. And I remember what Mammoo said

"Simple persons can make us fall by heart."

But I'm not falling in love to Yhannacause I am just playing her and planning to hurt her feelings.

"Mammoo, this is my partner in our examination performance. She's Yhanna Rose." I introduced Yhanna to Mammoo. Mammoo handed a warm hands and they shake hands together.

"Oh so you are Yhanna. The girl he always talks about."

What? The girl I always talk about? Wow! What a nice joke Mammoo. You're making a story.

"You are so beautiful" I know Mammoo was impressed by her simplicity. And that caused her beauty.

"Thank you..." Yhanna took a long paused.

"Ah..you can call me Mammoo." Mammo said

I saw her smile. We walked into a piece of grassland it is located behind our house. It's all green. For a while Mammoo went into the kitchen to refrigerate her homemade chocolate cake inventory as she wanted to call it and when she's back we start the ballroom practice.

"First! Before we start. I want you to know that ballroom is a kind of dance for couples. So act as you're a couple"

"Mammoo..?" I cut off her but she ignores me instead she continue speaking on us.

"Erase the awkwardness."

Mammoo took my arms and taught me the right position on my arms. My arms are on Yhanna hips, gentle but I feel cold and now Mammoo took Yhanna arm and put it on my shoulder.

"Now. Look at each other's eye together" She said."

"Mammoo, let's start the real practice" I groaned. But she ignores me again.

"Maybe it's better if we should follow your Mammoo." Yhanna whispered on me.

"Okay." I whispered back.

I gaze into Yhanna's eyes as she. I think we're gazing at each other for more than five minutes, first I feel so awkward. But in every way, I think I want my eyes forever to stare on her.

The moment later, Mammoo clapped her hands. She's counting for steps and we start the dance gently.

I slowly put my left foot forward and then Yhanna slowly puts her right foot backward. She moved her right foot forward and I put my foot backward we're still looking at each other. Holding on gaze it's what had Mammoo said. And then I quickly place my left foot at side and I move a bit forward. And at the same time she put her right foot at the side and moves it a bit backward. I closed my right foot to my left foot and Yhanna did the reverse.

After our practice, Mammoo went into kitchen again to get the chocolate cake she baked for Yhanna and an orange juice. While we wait for Mammoo I had a small talk with Yhanna.

"Can I ask you something?" I said we're sitting in a cottage made up of bamboo wood. We're a few inches far from each other.

"Yes"

"Why did you transfer here?"

She's silence for a moment.

"Because we haven't yet paid the house that was sold to us and the owner of the house wanted us to leave then my father decided to go here. We live in the house of my past grandparents." She paused for a short moment. "and thank someone."

I stare at her beautiful eyes.

"Thank someone?" I asked curiously.

"For saving my brother when he was drowned in the pool."

I knew why Yhanna is familiar into my memory; I knew why her little brother is familiar to me. Cause I remember now.

I saved her little brother and I was so awful because I didn't have any clothes to wear while I dry my clothes. I saw Yhanna Worrying about Michael if he was going to be alright and Mr. Ben said he was.

"Yes. I haven't yet thanked you" She said.

There's something that I am feeling now, I am one of the reasons why she transferred here. I don't know if this is just a coincidence or something, SOMETHING.

"Chance" She pause and look up at the blue sky. "That's all I know when I saw you in school, I prayed to see you again, I am the kind of girl who would feel bad of myself if I didn't say thank you to someone who had helped me. And it seems that God had given me the chance"

She gazed on me.

Her eyes are on me. The moment seems to freeze. I cannot breathe. I do not know how many seconds we're gazing at each other's eye when Mammoo is back on us with KC, one of our chambermaids. Mammo is holding a tray of chocolate cake. I smell the sweetness again that makes me hungry honestly. She's a perfect baker. Mammoo put the tray on the table that is also made of bamboo wood. The cottage didn't have roof. But we don't feel the burning heat of the shinning sun because of the shade of Narra, 3 meters away from the cottage where we sat KC put the glass with orange juice and left Yhanna. Mammoo says we have to practice every day to make the dance perfect. After the practice I Drove Yhanna home.

When were already in their house. I parked the car. She opened the door and went out. When I start turning on the engine, I'd hear her voice calling my name.

"August!" she shout a bit.

I looked at her over the open window of my car.

She whispered a word and smiles. Wind in her hair, I think I like the moment very well. And even though there's no voice that comes out from her vocal to say the words, I did to hear it. I really did. It's a precious "THANK YOU".

Chapter Five: THE ROSE FAMILY

When I'm awake, it is Monday again; I did my daily routine when there's a class. I took a shower, I brushed my teeth. I wore uniform, I combed my hair, I ate breakfast, I drove into school and had fun w/ my friends.

We're sitting on the bleachers of the gymnasium. Carmeo, Breet, James, John, Emy, and Tiffany are my companion. Francis is absent today. I'd read his letter of excuse and it says that his not feeling well. We're watching some of our classmates practicing the dance they had pick on our P.E. it's only 4 days before the performance. Tiffany and Brett had pick the folk dance. Francis and Caithe had the waltz. James and Carmeo had the modern polka. John and Emy for the Tango Theater. I didn't see them practicing but I know they always. And me? I don't know what to say. A moment late, I see Yhanna coming for us with a sheaf of books in her arm.

"She's coming to us" Carmeo murmured.

"Hi August." She paused a while and then smiled.

"I'm here to say that my mother is still sick so I think I can't practice w/ you. I hope it's fine."

She continued.

My friend's looking over me.

"Oh.Yeahit's fine" I said w/ a nod.

"Thank you" she left us together w/ out letting her smile fade.

When she's gone in our sights, John had put my shoulder.

"What?" I said.

They just smile and laugh like crazy. And I know what's on their mind, I know what they think. It's like the mind of Francis. You know it well.

"No." I said

"What's your plan about her?" said Carmeo.

I took a breath and then answered her.

"Well I know she had a feelings for me and I can't blame her for that. I know 80% of the girls here in the campus had a crush on me or even like me" I paused for a seconds and let the silence pass by. "And like what I did to my girlfriends" they knew what I mean so I didn't resume.

"Oh? I thought that is a part of your new year's resolution" Tiffany said.

"To have girlfriends more than thirteen or above. Yes, but playing girls and hurting them, No." I stood and I left them sitting on the bleachers

Mr. Roezlithberg our English subject teacher says goodbye to us. he's our last subject teacher in every afternoon class. When everyone's out of the classroom I saw Yhanna still sitting on her chair. I think something is going wrong on her so I speak to her.

"Is there something wrong Yhanna?" I asked her.

When she looks up at me I saw her crying.

"Why?" I worried. I sat beside her to make her clam.

"Mom is so sick and getting worst" she sobbed."I am worried about her."

"Don't worry she'll be okay" I whispered to her.

I decided to drive her home to see if there is something that I can do to help her. When we arrived I parked my car in a space lot as always.

When we're inside their house we directly went her mother's room. When Yhanna open the door I saw Micheal he's on her mother's warmth. Unawake the moment her mother notice us, she slowly opened her eyes.

"You're already home." Her mother whispered.

"Hey" Yhanna says w/ a smile on her face. She kisses her mother's check. "August is with me, mom"

Her mother looked at me.

"Hi August how are you?" she looked me w/ her low tone voice.

"Hello Auntie. I saw your daughter cried because of too much worried about you. So I decided to went here w/ her. And to see if I have something to help you" I said.

Yhanna embraced her mother.

"I will be fine" her mother says. And a few moment her eyes is closed again something is happening

I called Dr. West our personal doctor. and I pleased him to check my friend's mother and he did he said that everything's going to be fine. He says Annie's Fever will be no more for four weeks. All she need is a rest Dr. west gave them a medicine and vitamins to help Annie feel good in a short period of time. I thanked Dr. West for helping Yhanna's mother. I thanked him for going personally to my friend's house and giving them medicines.

It was fine in the afternoon when we left Annie and Micheal. I am w/ Yhanna we've gone to the market and then buy Annie some fruits. She insists about what I am doing but I just ignore her. After marketing we went into the mall. I bought Annie Beautiful clothes so that I can make her smile somehow. I also bought Micheal a pair of shoes and clothes, finally I bought Yhanna an elegant purple dress w/ silver dust that shines when there's light, I know this really fits her. She's still insisting but I still didn't care.

"No August I still have a nice dress" she insisted.

"No. I want you to wear this one on our performance" I grin gently.

She remained hush for a while and then finally thanked me.

TUESDAY

This day Yhanna and I still didn't have practice. I can't find her in school. She's absent I wanted to go to ther house but my friends planned to hang out tonight so I go out w/ them.

WEDNESDAY

Yhanna is still absent in the class. After my class I decided to go to their house.

I knocked the door but it seems that didn't hear it. There's no one who opened it. I knocked the door again and there finally it had open.

"August" she whispered "You're here."

"Yes. You're two days absent and I am... worried".

"You don't need to worry about me"

"No. not you. You're mother"

She smiled and let me inside. I sat in a wooden chair.

"So how's your mother? Is she fine?" I asked her.

"She's,,," her words were cut when her mother personally answered my question.

"I'm already fine, August" She comes toward us with a glass of a combination of strawberry and apple. Then she sat w/ us.

"Thank you for everything August" Annie said.

"You are very welcome Auntie"

Yhanna stood up and excuse him. For she will cook their dinner. We are left. Her mother and i.

"You know. Your parents should be proud of you"

"Why should they?"

"Because you are a good person"

"No, I'm not".

She put her palm on my arms. I can feel the warmth.

"You are" She whispered.

"If I are, they don't need to have and stay a hundred or a thousand miles away from me.. I stayed silent for a moment.

"And I am a good person why my mother had left me" in that moment I didn't knew that I was already Crying. "She didn't give me my name before she was gone." I was sobbed.

I breathe and then apologize to Annie.

"I'm sorry. I didn't help myself" I said

"It's Okay" She whispered. I still feel her warm palm into my arms.

"Yhanna and Michael are lucky because they had a beautiful and caring mother. If God will give me a chance to choose the kind of mother I wanted to have I wanted to her to be like you".

"What if one day you're mom showed up to you?"

She asked me.

"Would you still accept her"

She added.

"I will never ever accept her anymore"

For a moment later there's a knocked on the door Yhanna had open it and I heard she says "DAD" for the first time I will meet her father. Yhanna embraced her father and briskly gone back to the kitchen. Her father saw me.

"Oh? We have a visitor." He said.

"Yeah he's August the boy who Yhanna always talked about"

He laughed and comes to us.

"Hi sir, I am august" I said I give a hand.

"I'm Herald I'm Yhanna father." we shake hands together

"What if you have your dinner here?"

"I think that's a good idea." Annie Agreed.

I looked at my wrist watch. It's 7:48 pm already. I accepted the offer. I called Mammoo that I will have my dinner in Yhanna's. She said Okay.

After the dinner, Yhanna used to wash the plates. Her mom's in their room w/ Micheal singing him a lullaby to sleep. Yhanna father and I were still in the table. We had a small talk.

"Yhanna says you helped my wife when she got sicked."

I smiled.

"Thank you." He said.

"I am willing to help, sir"

For a moment I saw a spark from his eyes going to down his face, tears.

"I am only a farmer never been in school we are poor I cannot take my family to the hospital whenever they're sick" he shrugged w/ his tears.

"It's alright sir. The important thing is that everything's fine your wife is okay and we're nothing to worry about."

"Sometimes I really blame myself and I really hate myself because I cannot fill their needs. I cannot give them a beautiful life."

I laughed.

"You don't know the life of being a rich sir."

Silence passed between us for a minute.

"You are so lucky. Because even though you don't have a lot of money..."

I paused a while.

"You had still your family. And that's what makes you rich". I said.

Chapter Six: THROUGH THE RAIN

THURSDAY

After our class, Yhanna and I spent the time left to practice in my house and then Mammoo strictly taught us it was the last day of our practice so we need to become serious for the practice.

FRIDAY

Before the performances starts, Miss Swift tell her good luck and she also says do our best for it is our grade. The performances will be held on the stage.

We're on the backstage I knew Miss Swift invited some teachers and students to be our audience. I know there will be huge audiences. But I hope a few will come.

A moment later, performances had begun but I feel a bit nervous. I'm nervous because Yhanna is not here. She never told me that will be late but I know she will never allow herself to miss this we practiced it. And we're really spent hard time practicing it. And if she will not going to perform it with me she will fail. The performance starts w/ salsa. After the salsa Tiffany and Brett is on stage for the folk dance what an epic dance w/ this turn lovely partner. Or lets we say a two lovely couple after their dance performance John and Emy followed on stage for the Tango Theater Dance. Miss Swift had arranged the performance in order by number. There are 16 numbers and Yhanna and I were the last to perform. We're 16th the last pair. Another pair for hip hop dance was called. Followed by ballet Tap Rumba.Francis and Caithe for waltz.A perfect performance. African pairs were called. Jazz Contemporary. Foxtrot. James and Carmeowas next to perform. I laughed to Carmeo. Lyrical Lyndy hop was followed. There's only 3 dance performances but Yhanna is still nowhere I don't know if you can call it still a late. The two pairs for Cha-Cha-Cha was called and my pulse gone stronger and stronger. After their performance samba square was the next. I'm feeling insane w/ my red long she cut and a striped blade necktie on my neck. My nervousness grow stronger and stronger. I do not know what will happen if Yhanna weren't still here before the samba square ends and calls our name. I might be in a full shame. I think, my friends are already worrying about our performance. I lost my breath when the pain that performs samba square was done already.

The moment number 16 was called, I know Yhanna and I will fail the subject. There's still no Yhanna Rose showed up. I am no option but to face the small crowd and apologize. The moment I stood on the stage, everyone's eye focused on me. Wondering why I am alone and doesn't have a pair. Wondering where my partner is. I saw Miss Swift rises on her seat. And finally I had spoken. I took a deep breath and these are the words that comes out w/ the flow of my breath.

"I'm sorry." The audience starts murmuring. I looked at a corner and I saw a familiar face. I never knew she was going and witness our dance. I know she'll feel bad. But let's accept the fact anyway that Yhanna and I will be the only pair from our class that fails to perform.

"My partner is..." As I continue my apologize to the small crowd and miss swift I became speechless for a moment. Just one moment in time.Yhanna took her steps towards me. The audience was frozen including me. Yhanna is wearing the purple dress I bought for her. With the lights silver but sparks on it. she's too beautiful. She's different now w/ her make up w/ her purple pink lips shinning w/ her curly hair w/ her beautiful eyes. She is changed.

When she's w/ me. She said her sorry. Before I let her explain I grab her arms and put it on my shoulder. And came her little grin. And the sweet music begins to play.

"You are too beautiful for me." I whispered her softly as I stare my eyes into her while we dance the ballroom perfectly.

"I am too simple for you." She whispered me back.

My nervousness had really gone when she came in and we dance.

"And that is the reason why I like you." I don't know how my tongue pronounced those words involuntarily. But all I know was I meant it. I really meant it.

I saw her eyes in doubt. She didn't say something. Instead she looked down on her feet. Her eyes avoiding mine. I don't know why.

When our performance is perfectly done, everyone gave us a big round of applause. They were screaming "perfect". I guess they liked our performance. Or they liked us. Yhanna and I our chemistry.

When we get back into the backstage,Yhanna still didn't respond for what I have said to her we still in the stage Dancing.

Mammoo cooked me delicious food for what I did. She always says that it was perfectly amazing and apologized me for something she did.

"Sorry if I didn't tell you that I brought Yhanna a beauty salon."

"Mammoo, it's still fine if Yhanna doesn't were make ups and she doesn't need any beauticians. You got me feel very nervous. I thought I will become so shame."

"Okay sorry for that" Says she in a low voice. "But I knew you liked it, didn't you?" she continued.

I've become a hush for a moment.

"Alright, she's too beautiful. She amazed me. She's wonderful in her looks. And..." I stopped to think some words to describe her.

"And you're in love." Mammoo fills my incomplete sentence.

I bowed down my head.

"Honestly yes, I'm really in love with her. And I'd never feel something like this before." I confirmed.

I've never thought that I will be captivated. I'd never thought I could fall into a girl I didn't like. I'd never thought that my evil plans for Yhanna will be destroyed. I'd never thought that I would miss her eyes after that night's performance. I'd never thought that I wanted to be with her. I'd never thought that Francis is right. I'd never thought that Mammoo is right too. A person who lives life simple makes them beautiful. And a simple person makes us fall by heart. And it's true. I am truly in love. I love Yhanna.

When I finished my dinner, I went to my room and I spend half of an hour recalling the moment I held Yhanna's eyes. The moment we danced. The moment when I said she's beautiful. And the moment that I told her my real feelings. I don't know what she's doing now. I don't know if she got angry with me when I told her I'm falling in love with her. I don't know if she loves me too. But I wish she does. Yhanna is a simple girl and that what's made me fall in love with her. 3 hours after our dance and I missed her already. I want the night to quickly turn into morning to see her in school.

A moment later I fall asleep. And I am dreaming about Yhanna. I am dreaming that I kissed her in the lips. It's so soft and the rain falls, I tell how love her. She becomes quite for a little and my heart beats fast as I heard the words I've been praying and the pouring rain was falling hard as I kissed her again.

When I wake up my eyes feel sore of the morning light out of my open window. I forgot clearing it before I've been slept. I looked at the clock it's 7:05 am and it's Saturday. No class, I am wondering why my clock didn't alarmed. I guess Mammoo had turned it off. I jump off of the bed mattress and then went directly into the shower after shower Mammoo had already prepared a breakfast for me.

"Mammoo" I started at her while she's w/ me having a breakfast. "I am planning to apologize for what I had said to Yhanna. I think I was wrong for telling my feelings for her."

After the breakfast I ordered Joe to wash my car as I wait the chocolate cake Mammoo had baked. I am having thoughts on how to apologize to her. On how to say it correctly without offends her. When Joe's finished washing my car, Mammoofastly baked the chocolate cake. She wants me to personally give it to Yhanna. Before I went into their house I stopped into a flower shop and bought Yhanna white roses.

When I'm already in their house I parked my car in a space lot, as always. And when I'm in front of the door I had slowly knocked on the door. Yhanna opened it. She was standing in front of me. I am holding a paper bag on my left. I choose to hide the flowers behind my back. I hope Yhanna is not angry at me.

"Hi" I said w/ a smile on my face. I'm nervous, really.

"Why are you here?" she said at me. By her voice I cannot tell she's angry or what so ever she's calm. She is peace.

"I'm sorry Yhanna" I said after a quick paused.

"For what?"

"For what I said"

"You mean we could be together?" she stares at me for a moment.

"You are not real" she whispered.

"What do you mean I am not real?"

"You"

"Me?" I shrugged.

"Yeah" she looked down her feet "Everybody in school talks about you. And I hear that you're playing girls feelings and I believe them."

I took a deep breath.

"Fine! I play girls, I hurt them. But when you step into my life, I became real." I bit the upper part of my lips and looked down. I put down the paper bag w/ a chocolate cake inside that had Mammoo baked for her. And then look on her eyes again I want to give the roses but I think it's going to be bad. Maybe she will throw it if I will give it.

"Yhanna. I am really in love w/ you" I whispered.

She didn't respond or say anything. Instead she went to her garden. Her garden w/ full of Myrtles, I followed her in her steps. Still the roses behind my back. I can smell fragrance again so sweet and real. Like my feelings for Yhanna.

I found myself in the garden. With Yhanna, I am behind her for five inches. She looked up the sky. Her hair moves by the flow of the wind.

For a moment, I speak.

"What can I do to make you believe that I really love you?" I asked her.

Her head still up in the sky.

"Nothing August... he" she paused while her eye's still in the scary and blue sky. "I'll depend on him."

"What do you mean him?"

"God." She whispered. "You're love is real." She said and faced me. "If it will rain." She continues.

I laughed w/ disappointment.

"Yhanna, its weather! "It's predictable." I sighed.

"And I know it won't rain today because I had watched the weather forecast this morning." I added.

"Yes, it is predictable. But you cannot predict what God's will." She walked against me and went inside their house. She thanked me for the cake and the closed the door. I am standing alone in her garden. With the heat of the burning sun.with a blue sky. With a clear day. I'm hopeless because I know it won't rain. But I wish it will. Hope and faith. That was in the back of my mind as the rose's falls from behind my back.

I walked into my car and turned the engine on. It starts to run. But slowly. God knows I'm really in love w/ her. God knows it.

I'm only a few meters away from Yhanna's house when the engine stops. I don't know why. It still has a gasoline. I checked if it's the wheel but it's not. I check the engine and I didn't saw something wrong. Why is this happening? As I'm about to get angry w/ my car. I heard a big sound of thunder. The blue sky quickly turned into a dark gray w/ black clouds covering the sun's face. And then a few drops of water fall gently. And when it falls so hard I get inside of my car. And Yhanna's name flashes of my mind. And this rain was God's. I briskly gone out if my car and then ran. Going to Yhanna's house. I don't care about the rain, pouring hard. I don't care about the people around me. All I care is Yhanna.

A few distances away from their house, I saw Yhanna. Running and coming into me. Like me, she didn't care about the rain or the people around us. When our body touched, I hugged her so tight and she.

"This is God's will." She said.

I hold her hands and look over her eyes.

"Yes, it is because he knows how I love you. Because he knows that I am real." My eyes are now in tears.

Streaming down in my face w/ the rain.

She's crying too.

I touched her lips w/ my thumb. It's soft.

"I love you, Yhanna." I whispered and kissed her lips finally. In the pavement.In the middle of the pouring rain.

Chapter Seven: UNEXPECTED THINGS

After the morning class, I called my friends for lunch. Especially Yhanna.

"So August, what's the big news?" Say Francis.

"I had never introduced a person who is not important into me." I said. Yhanna is beside me. I know Francis is happy because he knows that he is right.

Their attention is focusing on me. "YhannaRose is my now my girlfriend." I smiled. They clapped their hands for me and Yhanna. Especially Francis. Tiffany kisses me. "Finally, your heart is captivated." She said.

After our class, I drove Yhanna home. I want to see sure that she's safe all the time. I don't want everyone to hurt her. As long as I am with her. I'll swear that she will never hurt.

As I am home, Mammoo talked to me.

"August, she really changed you." Mammoo embrace me.

"Yeah. I don't know what will happen is she will be gone from me."

"But that's not ever gonna happen." She said.

"Why don't you plan a dinner here in the house w/ Yhanna and her parents. You know I want to meet her parents. I'm sure they were lovely parents because Yhanna grew up w/ her good attitude and I can see it on herself." Mammoo added.

"I think that's a good idea, Mammoo."

"Yes, of course."

"And you're right, Mammoo. Yhanna parents are so nice I'm sure you'll be glad to meet them."

Mammoo planned the dinner and she likes to be the one to cook. I went into Yhanna's house and invited them for the dinner.

"Mammoo wanted to meet your parents" I said.

"I'm ashame and my parents , too"

"No reason to be ashame" I hold her hands and kissed her arm.

"your are my girlfriend".

"Okay, When?" she agreed finally.

"Tomorrow. I'll pick you tomorrow's eve w/ your parents, is that okay?"

She nodded.

"Mammoo is so excited to meet your parents"

"I hope she will like them"

"I know she will."

"And I hope she like me too"

"On the very first day she already did" I whispered to her and I kissed her forehead.

When I am about to go home, Yhanna please me to stay for a five minutes she grab my hands and I've walked to her garden and we sat for a long minutes there.

"You love myrtles?" I said.

"Yes. I like its sweet scents"

"So am I."

Twilight turns into a full night. The stars are burning in the night day. There's no moon. We layed down our heads into the grasses, while our hands holding together seems like we don't want to be far away from each other. We wanted to hold each other's hands forever. A few moments takes as our eyes on the night sky a falling star shines. I looked at Yhanna face she closes her eyes.

"What is your wish?" I asked.

"I wish that god will never break us."

I hold her hands tighter.

"God will never." I inhaled the scents of myrtles brought by the cold wind.

"You'll be mine and I'll be yours forever." I kissed her lips.

As Mammoo w/ our chamber maid prepared the foods I took my shower and I picked up the simplest clothes. It took at least an hour of choosing what clothes I should wear. The idea flashes on my Mind that I should wear simple clothes. As what had Mammoo said, simplicity mashes someone falls. When I'm finished in my wardrobe I quickly get in the car to pick Yhanna and her parents.

When I arrived in their house, they are already waiting for me. Yhanna mother is wearing a red dress. Her lips are also in red and like Yhanna she is beautiful. Sir herald wore only a white t-shirt. But looks handsome.Micheal is handsome, too w/ his blue checkered polo. Yhanna wore the dress she wore in our performance. That purple dress w/ silver dust that shines when light strikes. But she didn't put a make-up. And her hair is in a beautiful style. I guess her mother did it

Auntie Anne sir Herald and Michael is at the back seat and the special girl is in the front seat I took her hands and kissed it. I'm still holding her hands w/ my right hands white I my left hands is on the control of the car. Her parents knew how much that I love her. So the feel more comfortable when they know that she's with me.

Love is something beautiful. It is something that you can't ignore or take away. It is something that God's surprise gift it's a feeling that makes you smile every time you woke up in the morning every time you fall asleep you still wearing the smile that joy really brings. It is a feeling that makes us calm and piece when there's a bad thing love happens when God wanted it will turn you into an angel from being a devil. Love clears the wounds and fears. That our heart endures, you feel fearless you feel love when you misses him/her ever though it's only a few seconds that right into a beautiful morning to see him/her in a school. When you feel crazy when you're not being w/ him/her. When you miss the moments you've shared together. A phenomenon or whatever you want to call it. it's love when you don't want to stay a thousand miles away from him/her. It's love when your heart beats fast. It's a wonderful thing that I don't want to end. I hate the word "End". Really I will let anyone or anything to destroy Yhanna and I relationship when you're in love you will do everything for him/her. Because love is all beautiful.

When we arrived already I quickly went down and I open the door of my car for Yhanna. And her parents too, when they are out of the car sir Herald always says "wow" Micheal also. I am with Yhanna holding her hands still while we head going to the door.

When we're already in front of the door, Yhanna hold my hands tighter.

"I'm Nervous" She said. Her parents are behind of us.

"Don't be nervous okay?" I kissed her hands

When I opened the door, I smelled a floral cent; I think Mammoo sprayed a sanitizer. I led them into the dining table. Chamber maids greeted us w/ their white and black uniform. The table is ready. Different delicious on the table, a large chocolate cake is on the center. We sat on the chairs and our maid starts serving us. But I can't find Mammoo.

"Where's Mammoo?" Yhanna asked me.

I asked KC if where do Mammoo and she say she's in the kitchen doing the juice experiments.

"Call her say that Yhanna and her parents are already here" I commanded.

They didn't still touch their foods.

"Uh... You can eat your food." I said but they insist. They don't want to eat the food unless Mammoo came on the table.

A moment later, Mammoo showed up with a glass pitcher up a color blue juice. I don't know what juice is that or what fruit had Mammoo used.

"Hey! Welcome everyone, I..." she was shocked when she saw Yhanna mother. Her eye's wide open. Auntie Annie stood quickly w/ tears in her eyes. Quickly falls on the ground. The glass pitcher from Mammoo hands slipped and fell into the ground. The blue juice places on the ground. The glass pitcher turned into small pieces of crystals. Like small diamonds every one of us became froze and Mammoo whispered a name.

My atmosphere burned when I heard the name: STEPHANNIE.

Chapter Eight: LOVE AND HATE

I felt like I became a devil again from a romantic angel my hell transformation. My eye's should pour a cluster of tears but instead it was a burning fire w/ blazes as I look at Stephanie. My life became unperfected because of her. I can feel the combination of pain and angry. I can't breathe I'm extra nervous to be calm but not this time anymore. My mother who I didn't know and touch the face. My mother who left me for about 16 years, my mother who made me a rebel, my mother who broke my heart for the first time, is now with me in our house.

"Is he my son?" she whispered looking one Mammoo.

I saw Mammoo added. Stephanie is going towards me. But I took a step back.

"August" I heard she tried to embrace me but I inch myself away from her. When she tried to be close on me I shoved her. She falls on the ground where the glass pitcher broke she propped her right elbow I saw a dark red blood on her arms flowing w/ tears she was wounded the broken glass Mammoo bristle moved herself to help Stephannie. Sir Herald, Michael and Yhanna too my sweet Yhanna I cannot describe her face that night. It was a combination of fears and doubts.

"August, why did you do that she's your mother!" Mammoo shouted.

"She is not my mother!" I replied "You are an embarrassment!" I shouted pointing my index finger to her. When I'm losing myself because of the angriness I feel for my mother I feel Yhanna's hands holding more I feel the warmth. And she pronounced my name hushly.

"August. She is your mother. Our Mother" She leaned and whispered.

Yeah. She is our mother that means Yhanna and I was siblings. So your love for each other must end now. But I don't understand my thoughts. Half of my heart is angry w/ her because she is my mother's daughter. And a half still romantically loves her. I don't know what to do. Maybe I need some space.

Another unexpected thing had happened that night. The night that should be the elegant dinner. We heard a sound of someone's home and he's coincidentally came in a right moment. Right here now, when we saw George his eyes were shocked, when he saw my mother Stephanie he gently walked into her sir Herald was speechless in that very moment. Carrying his son, Michael.Yhanna is w/ me still holding my cold hands.

"Stephanie" he swallowed.

I breathe hard and I walked out. I don't want to see them both especially Stephannie. They are the same with George even I know he is my father. But when I need his presence his nowhere, he is nowhere. And that makes me insurgent I released my hands Yhanna's holding. And left them all

I spend an hour and a half standing at my room verandah. Watching the stars, I make them calm for a while I felt hungry but I just ignored it. I know they are having a conversation the maid whispered to me. I feel cold and I remember the warmth of Yhanna's hands on me a while ago. A moment later I heard hard knocked on my door. I know it's not Mammoo knocked because I already memorize her knocks when she's on the other side of the door the way she knock is smooth but that hard knock, I knew it already it is George he knocked twice but I really ignored him I don't want to talk to him. Not now not this time. I wanted him to stop on knocking at my door and hopefully he did. A few moments o silence had passed by and then I heard another knocked from my door this time soft knock and I know who's the other side of the door. I leave the verandah and I went to in front of my door and then unlocked it and when I opened. The door I thought it was Mammoo, but it is Yhanna my love I hugged her tight and I pull her into the verandah I hold her hands. As it was the last touch.

"What they had talked about." I said.

"About you." She whispered.

"Yeah the are talking to me now but they don't care about me."

"They do, August."

"Just a simple words. They don't care about us so I don't care about them, too".

"Why you are like that?" her voice starts to rise.

"Because of them!" I raised my voice and silenced occurred.

"August. Since we know that we are siblings" she paused and looked into my eyes "We should end this all" She said.

The wind blew hard.

"There's a perfect and better girl than me August. Even though we loved each other let's accept that this is not right. It's wrong. You should love another."

I fell pain as she said it in front of me I cried then I couldn't help the tears falling into the ground. I see Yhanna is crying, too I don't want to lose her.

"I can't love anymore you are the only person who changed me. Who turned me into an angel from being bad" I Sobbed and runs my thumb into her cheek going to her lips.

"Maybe this affair is wrong. But I want you to know..." I took the hardest breathe in my whole life. "Loving you was the best thing that I do." I whispered I closed my eyes and I gently kissed her soft lips. I will soon miss her lips when we kissed the stars above was gone. And the rain poured silently.

I thought love is all happiness. I thought love is all beautiful things. I thought love makes you smile. I thought love will make you feel better. Thought love never makes a person cry. I thought I had never realized that after all the romantic moments that Yhanna and I have been shared this will change. I was hurt. My heart is all in pain my eyes swollen of crying and crying and crying. I am losing my mind. I am losing my-self. I am losing my soul. I am losing the reason why I changed a lot. Why I am angel. Why I am good. Why I am nice. I lost her my heart is in the heights of loneliness. I'm sorrowful. I want to die it seems that my heart doesn't want to beat w/ out Yhanna on my side w/ out feeling the warmth of her hands as she holds mine w/ out kissing her lips. Before was the happiness and joy of being in love and now I am in the feeling of sadness and sorrow of being in love. Yhanna had really changed me and now that she's gone from me everything will change again. I know because I am feeling it right here now.

I took my clothes off of the wardrobe and then put it on my bag. I want to be alone. I want to be having space. I want to be found my-self. When I'm about to exit the house that night, George and Mammoo stopped me.

"Where are you going?" George says.

"In a place where no one will find." I roll my eyes.

"You don't need to leave, August" Mammoo said. She's crying now. She embraced me then.

"I'm sorry Mammoo. I just want to be find my-self" and I released her arms from embracing me and then I left them.

I am going to New Orleans, LA.

I don't want to go to my friend's house to stay there I want to be far away. So far while I drive my phone rang and rang. Bud I didn't answer the calls. A moment I got it to see who was calling. Francis. I scroll down and it was Carmeo's name. I scroll down again. Brett, Tiffany, Jon, Emy, James. My friends. George called, too. When I saw a gasoline station I turned off the engine of my car and I refill I will travel so far so I want to make sure that my car's fuel is enough. When I'm inside of my car again, I feel cold. I turned off the air conditioner and I wore on sweater. Drizzle falls. The road was so slippery because it rained but I feel brave that moment even though I know that the road is so slippery I keep driving so fast and fast. I don't care if accident embraces me.

I decided to stay in Marriot hotel. One the most beautiful hotel here in Los Angeles. The word is in the French Quarter boasting fantastic Coral street location just a few steps from Bourbon Street. I like the lights. I can see the reflections of it from the surface of the water. When I get in w/ my bag, the two guards welcomed me in. when I walked through the lobby a middle aged man assisted me he helped me to find a room and give me the key of the room. I rode an elevator going to fourteenth floor. When the elevator's door automatically opened I found silence. There's no such people maybe they are already at sleep. I watched my clock and because it's already 12:51 midnight when I head straight I saw the ROOM 113. My room aged man assisted me when I'm inside, the room is wonderful. Beautiful from the ceilings into the floors. I smell an orange cent. The air conditioner spreads ever where. But I sighed I remember the pain again I threw my bag at the corner and I lay my body hard on the soft bed the white mattress and little puckers forward. I breathe hard. I still feel bad. I'm not still not feeling well. I missed Yhanna again but I need to be far away.

I didn't have eaten anything that night. Ignoring my hungriness because of my anger forStephannie is still reigning. Half of an hour that I was measurerized by the lingering thoughts of my word. And when I closed my eyes, I fall asleep.

When I wake in the morning I felt the butterflies in my stomach. Growling not flying. I'm now hungry. I went to the dining room and ordered breakfast I was in the house Mammoo would wake up early just to cook me for breakfast. As I am sitting in my table and waiting for the food I wondered what's happening in the house now. I am wondering if George didn't care if what had happened then leave the house's door again for his work. I am wondering what Mammoo feels right now I know she's crying now. But I hope she understands me. I hope she's fine. I am wondering if Stephannie would apologize to me or say anything that will make me pity on her so I would accept the truth that she is my mother. I am wondering about Sir Herald. About what he's feeling right now. I'm not angry w/ him though he's the uneducated man who my mother remarried. I am wondering about my friends they are worrying about me right now. Because I'm not going to Alexander Hamilton High School. And I can't help my mind of thinking Yhanna. I hope God will make everything fine and alright again. He is the only one I've known who could help me out of these nightmares. She's between the love and hate of my soul.

Chapter Nine: ESCAPING FEARS

I stayed in the hotel for about two weeks. But even though I'm two weeks away from home I still feel the same feeling I felt that night. I think I can't escape from this trouble anymore. After eating my dinner I went outside the hotel and breathe same fresh air. I sat into a bench. Behind is a fountain. The air was cold and it soothes into the lad level of my epidermis. I went away from them to find my-self but I didn't seem to find it. I'm still losing my-self when the weird blew hard fine dust of water from the fountain splashes on me. I see people w/ their smiles everywhere. Couples and families. As I looked up into the night sky I see stars no more. I feel bad about everything. What's the reason why God had let me suffered this pain and sadness and sorrows and anger. I'm starting to become a faithless sinner. I'm starting to put angriness into him. I feel hatred what's he's plan about me? I just want to know sometimes. God also makes the person faithless. Because of those difficulties in life that he makes us suffer a moment later, I received a text message from Mammoo.

"Do you still have a plan to return home? I respect what you feel right now and I understand it. But you cannot be an angel rebel forever. Life still goes on you have to face your fears." What was she had said through the text, when I closed the inbox I saw an unread message. I opened it and I saw the name: GEORGE. I read the message. "Happy birthday." I am 17 now.

I forgot that it was February 12 that night. I didn't know that it was my birthday already. And it's because of what I felt I forgot everything about me. I want to go somewhere where I can celebrate my birthday. If I was home, Mammoo will surely organize a party for me. And she will invite my close friends.

I head straight along the way and took a little walk. I saw a bar and I went inside. I heard a noisy music. My car hurts theme's a lot of people inside the bar who were dancing, drunken, small talking and etc. I ordered a drink and when I sipped a few I tested the bitterness and a little sweetness. Like my lips I had five glasses of that kind of drink when I feel dizzy. Symptoms of a drunk person. Usually I had 10 or more glass of a drink before I'm drunk. But this drink is different. I went outside. The air still so cold but I feel warm. I feel heat. I feel fine inside of me suddenly, I saw wooden beach with a hawthorn free beside. I sat there for long minutes. I see things around one leap spinning and spinning.

Someone who sat beside me, a few inches of distance she was so shiny and hairless I can see the cracks from her lips even I'm dizziness. Her color is so pale so grey. I saw a bible on her arms.

"Hi!" she said

"Hello" I replied.

"Why are you drinking beverages?"

"Because i want to forget the pain"

"Exactly. But in the morning it is back again"

"I will drink again"

"But it's dangerous and it can cause you cancer."

"Okay fine, fine, fine. Tell me about everything you know!" I rise my voice.

"You should be glad about your life. Do not waste it. I have a cancer and I only have days to live my life" I saw the tears on her eyes. "I am living it perfect as I can. With God"

She whispered.

"You're case is different into mine" I said then begun saying my case "I lived my life for almost 16 years. w/ out a mother. She left me when I was five. She didn't care about me. I know it. I have my father, but like my mother he's not home every day to see me growing. Until I met a girl and then I really fall w/ her. And I found out that were siblings. Her mother is my mother, too. I cannot accept it. I feel half of hatred about her and half of love. But I feel more of hatred to my mother. In destroyed everything and so the reason why I am here I went away from them to find my-self and I don't know when I will be back"

"So your mother was the whole reason?"

"Yes"

"She left you, but I'm sure she regrets it"

"No. she didn't"

"I cannot help you because I'm not God. All I can say is that you should go back to where you are and accept everything. I know it's not easy but someday it will be". She stood

"When I'm in heaven I'd ask God to help you. Goodbye" she whispered and gone into my sight.

In the morning I packed my things up. I am planning to go home now. Even I still feel bad. When I'm driving home I heard a railing of the church's bell. I stopped my car and I went inside I spend an hour praying. I prayed for the girl who had a cancer and had only 8 days of life who lit me through the darkness where I'm in for a while I prayed god to change the wheel of my life and turn everything's right. When the mass was finished I refueled my car and have my long ravel again. The sun is burning and smiling I think and I know they missed me already.

When I arrived I parked my car in the garage. The house seems so silent I opened the door and still I found a quite atmosphere. "Mammoo?" I call her. I went into the kitchen and I saw her. Cooking I embrace her surprised and she screamed my name. She really missed me so much.

"I'm glad you're back!" she said w/ her tears eyes.

"Yes I am"

"Okay. Just go to your room and have some rest. I know you're tired. She said wiping her eyes. "I'' call you after I finish cooking so we can eat together again.

I missed my room. I put my bag on the table and then I took a shower. I feel grease about my sweat. I wanna refresh my self after the shower I wore a white t-shirt and went down going to Mammoo and I never expect him to see. My father.

"August." He said but I didn't answer him.

I went closed to Mammoo."Hey Mammoo is that already finished?"

I saw her eyes going to George "and answered me "Oh yes."

I leave them and I sat into the table white I wait for Mammoo to bring the food. I heard them talking Mammoo and George. Yes I am back but it's not easy for we to be fine at all right now.

We eat together w/ Mammoo. And George. But they are in silence. Until I broke it.

"He I wonder why you're here" I said to George.

"I'd took a day off"

"Oh? That's good! When will you coming back to work?"

"Maybe next week"

"That's bad!"

"August?"Mammoo said.

"Okay" I said rolling my eyes and finished my lunch.

When I'm about to go into my room George called my name.

"What?" I said.

"You had already 2 14 days of absences. And you need to go to school."

"What if I'm not?"

"I gave you the space and time to find yourself so it's time to start your life again" His voice rises.

"Alright." I screamed and I closed the door so hard to produce a loud banging sound.

My friends already know that I'm home. They are calling and texting but I ignore it all

I am awake in the infinite cold I felt last night and I read invisible words in the ceilings.

"It's time to go to school!" when I'm in the shower I heard a voice in my mind saying "Face your fears".

When I'm in school my friends really worried about me. They keep saying that I became a little thin they had embraced me tight when the saw me.

"You made us worried so much about you" Tiffany said Francis agreed.

"Where did you stay?" Asked Francis.

"In Marriott" I replied.

"And now that you're back I hope you're fine now" Said Carmeo

"No I'm still not. I still feel bad about everything"

"We Thought you came back because you're alright" Said John

"It's not that easy. I came home because I know that I can't escape what is right and what is true" I paused for a long seconds "Let's stop discussing this. By the way what's new?"

I said. They were hush for a moment and then turned their look going to a lonely girl sitting in a corner. It's Yhanna

"She Changed" Francis said

"What do you mean she changes?"

"She never smile anymore and she always not w/ herself."

"I think it's because of you" Carmeo says.

The bell rings. Time to go home.

"Let's go guys!" I said.

We passed be along where Yhanna is sitting. I know her eyes is looking at me even I'm not staring at her I passed by w/ my friends like she where not there I'm ignoring her presence. And I feel like I am killing my-self. I missed her but I want to avoid her. When I'm home I feel so bored so I decided wash my car instead of commanding it Joe a moment later I finished washing the car. As I wiped my wet hands I heard a voice saying my name behind me I turned my sight behind and I saw her again.

"What are you doing here?" I said w/ anger in my tone.

"I'm very thankful that you're back" My mother said.

"If you're here to see me well you just better go home. You're only wasting my time."

"August, I'm here because I'm your Mother"

There's a silence between us.

"Okay. You're here because you are my mother. Yes you are my mother" I shouted devilry. "But I don't need you."

I continued.

"It's alright w/ me. I will accept that you don't need me anymore as your mother. I want you to know that I regret. "She paused. Wiping her tears going down her face. "But I can't resist that I am the reason again of breaking your heart that should be not. I can't take that I am the reason why your affair w/ Yhanna had ended. But I am telling you, you can still love her both of you can still continue your relationship w/ each other. you, you can still love her. Both of you can still continue your relationship w/ each other."

"What? Are you insane?" I laughed at her.

"We are siblings and you want us to continue our wrong affair?"

"No" She sobbed "Because it's not wrong. It's right. Nothing is wrong." she whispered softly.

Chapter Ten: FOR THE FIEST TIME

First, I don't know what she meant. And when I caught what she turned to emphasize I because speechless, I want to speak but I can't from an unexpected things that had happened into my lips, another one came it's impossible. It's unbelievable. I can't believe this.

"Yhanna is not my real daughter, she is my friend's"

She said.

"Are you walking so fun or what?"

"I'm not making some fun. It's true"

I sighed up. Preventing my tears to fall.

"I had no chance to tell you it to you because you have gone" She added.

"She knows it?"

She Nodded.

I quickly got inside the car and turned in the engine. I am going into their house. I drive w/ a smile and excitement on my-self. I'm so excited to see and kissed her again. Though I can't still believe about what Stephanie said. I briskly parked the car and gone in front of their door. I screamed her name.

"Yhanna!!"

Thereafter, she opened the door.

"August."

we gazed at each other's eye and finally I hugged her soft body. I hugged her tight. Like I don't want to be away from her anymore, when I released my body from her I hold her hands. I feel the warmth again.

"I already knew about you. I already knew that you're not Stephannie's daughter. I already knew that we are not siblings or related. And I knew that we can love each other. Do you still love me?"

"Yes" She whispered.

I embraced her again.

She let me in of their house. Sir Herald was in the farm. Michael is playing a little car. I sat on the table waiting for Yhanna. She cooked me some food and juice. When she's back we begin our small talk.

"How are you?" she said.

"I became less bad when I knew that we can continue loving each other. How about you?"

"I feel sad."

"Why? I'm already here and I'll never leave again."

"No. Not because of you. But because I'm not your mother's real daughter"

"What do you mean?"

"I am mad because she's not my mother. You know what, even though I am not related to her she had treated me as her real daughter. She had treated me as her on flesh and blood. Even If not and I had never thought I am not her daughter. But I am so very thankful of her." She holds my hands.

"I hope one day you'll let her become your mother."

"What for?" I groaned.

"To let you know and feel what I am saying" she said.

I gave her a little nod.

While we talk, the door had opened and it was Stephannie who's standing straight. Our eyes met for seconds only and turn out my sight. Yhanna saw her, too.

"Mom! You're here" She stood and their embraced Stephannie w/ no doubts and regrets.

I stand up. I put my left hands on my product.

"I need to go. I cannot stay here any longer" I said as I hold my right hands into Yhanna's I can't resist to stay because of Stephannie.

"Okay take care" She kisses me on my cheek.

"Goodbye" I whispered kissing her forehead.

"When I'm about to open the door I heard Stephannie pronounced my name softly. I frozed holding the silver knob of the door through my right hand I didn't turn my sight to see her. I just stay frozen waiting for whatever things she would like to say at me.

"I'm sorry for everything" the atmosphere remained silent. "Drive home safely" She whispered.

From that moment, I didn't know what kind of gravity or force that had turned my-self opposite her Yhanna is looking at me. She is worried about the things that I would say. That would make Stephannie feel bad. But that's not the thing that happened.

"Okay" I swallowed. Breaking the silence between us.

I am busy planning for a picnic date for Yhanna and I I'm in the sala. W/ George. He's still in the house. I'm wondering why he's not back in his work. And I'm wondering why he's not back in his work. And I'm wondering why Mammoo still didn't greet me a happy birthday. Even my friends.

I walked going to my room when I notice everyone is busy. Mammoo is not around she's in the market today. I called my friends but they are not answering my call. Even my best friend, Francis I don't know what's going on this day this day is so weird.

When the clock strikes at 11 am. I took a shower. I wore a plain red t-shirt and a penshoppe pants. I want to go on w/ Yhanna that's what I've been thinking that day. But it's no need.

Mammoo knocked to my door. I opened it. Wondering why she had a make-up and looks nice today usually she doesn't' make her-self beautiful if there's no special occasion.

I went downstairs w/ Mammoo. There's a silence on every corner of the house. I only hear our footsteps. And I was shocked; everybody is there my classmates and friends. My subject teachers, Mammoos friends.The chambermaids.Sir Herald carrying Micheal.George infront of them, Stephannie and Yhanna. And they shouted "Belated Happy Birthday!" Together.

I turned my look at the table. Different delicious are on it. maybe I think it dishes plus a giant cake at the center of the table.

"Happy birthday" Mammoo had whispered say.

"Thank you so much, Mammoo" I hugged her

Yhanna embraces me; too I hold her hands and kissed it.

"Everyone! Let's start the party!" Francis Screamed and a loud music played.

We drink cocktails. When the disco music were played all dancing and dancing. I still didn't release Yhanna's hands on mine. I can see Mammoo having a lot of for w/ her different friends and w/ my subject teachers. I see Sir Herald on the table w/ Stephannie and George. They are eating. With small conversations. Francis, Brett, Carmeo, Tiffany, Jonh, Evy, and James are having some friends, too. They are really enjoying the party. They dance like it's no tomorrow. When Yhanna and I got tired of dancing I asked her to sit and eat where is rest for a while. The moment are sat, George and Sir Herald w/ Micheal turned the empty space into a dance floor. Disco music continues. I had never seen George like that. He really enjoys dealing w/ other people. Especially Sir Herald. He really had a big smile on his face and it seems like everything is alright. It seems that mother had happened. It seems that there is no problem. It seems that everything is normal. This is really a perfect birthday. And it seems to be unforgettable because I celebrated it w/ Mammoo, , with the presence of George and Stephannie. Although I don't talked to them and I celebrated this birthday w/ my loving girlfriend. Stephannie was still on her seat. Yhanna beside her w/ me.

"Why don't you join them?" Yhanna asked.

"No I like to watch them "she said.

"Go Mom. Join them. It's August Birthday so everyone should enjoy this day."

I feel a silence after I sliced a cake. Stephannie is looking at me.

"Yes. Why don't you join them?" I gave her a little grin. When I grinned on her I felt that I can breathe no hard anymore. I feel the lightness of my heart. Stephannie snouted, too. She stood and finally joined the dancing crowd.

After Yhanna and I finished eating the cake and salad we stood up together and also joined them dancing all of us hyperly dance. I don't want to end this day. Really I wanted it to stay like this I wanted forever. The cocktail drink that had Mammoo incented doesn't made us drunk or poke.

I am really happy today. I really enjoyed my birthday. And I'm still washing that this won't last. I can see big smiles on every faces. From MIcheal to the Oldest in the party. The deep resonant sound is still booming our hours. I cannot explain the joy after seven hours of dancing. We already feel the tiredness and pain in our feet. But others are still dancing I looked at my wristwatch. It's already 8:21 in the evening. Quick time flies. I let Yhanna dance w/ others and I sat beside Mammoo on the table. I embraced her.

"What?" she said.

"Thank you for all of this Mammoo"

"I'm sorry, August. But I am not the one who planned your Party."

"Then who?" I doubted.

"You father" she turned her sight then to George. "You need to thank him. He deserves it." she added.

I went to a corner where George standing alone. Holding her pleasure I think our company needs him already. But he still chooses to be w/ us. He still chooses to w/ me for my birthday.

"Dad" I called his name that was really the first time what I called him "Dad" in my whole life. For the first time I embraced him and my eyes began producing salt waters. I see happiness on his face when I call him dad. And for the first time in my whole life again I made him cry for the first time I'd never seen him crying before. I thought he doesn't know how to cry because all I knew he was a strong person. And was wrong even a strong person also cries.

"Thank you for this party, dad you really did a good job. I forgot everything."

"This is really for you, August. Because I wanna make you happy. I know that I never played my role as your father but no I am going to be"

I embraced him so tight again. And I heard someone behind we saying my name. when I looked back it's my mother.

"Happy birthday" She said.

I never hear knew my tears were already falling. A bundle of tears floating down. I run to her and hugged her and another for the First Time. Had happened in my life I Called her "Mom".

Chapter Eleven: PANORAMA

However. Things are getting back to normal again like a broken mirror that had fixed by God. I am really thankful of that dad spends a week w/ me I can call him now "Dad" we bonded for a week we laughed. With my Mom and her new family and with Yhanna of course. And after that week, dad went back to his work again.

In my room alone, I remembered the girl who had a cancer w/c enlightened my soul and mind. And heart. It is so sad that I didn't ever thank her. It so sad that I didn't know her name. It is so sad that I didn't meet her family to help them if they are asking and it so sad that she is living no more. But I don't want to be sad because I know she will be going to heaven. I remembered her farewell. She said that if she got in heaven, she'll ask God to help me. I haven't given a chance to thank this girl but I am praying for her.

I'm still preparing and arranging for the picnic date. I called the flower shops to provide flowers. I don't have a problem about the food because Mammoo will cook for me

The next day I went to their house to pick her I knocked the door and my Mom opened it.

"Hi, Mom" I hugged her.

"You're here." She said while I'm hugging her.

"Yeah".

She let me in.

"Just sit there. I will call Yhanna."

She went into the room and Yhanna Bulge by the door.

"Hey" she said.

"Hi!" I kissed her forehead. "are you fine?" I asked.

"mmm... why?"

"Secret"

"Ah. Let me think..."

"Please. Please please." Said w/ tenderness in my voice's tone.

"Okay" she said finally. "But let me fix my-self first"

She went into the room again. A moment later I saw her so beautiful again. I hold her hands.

"Mom. We will go out today" I said.

"Okay" Mom consent. "Just take care of yourselves" She give us a kiss.

I opened the right door of my car for Yhana. When we are inside of my car she asked me again if where we would go but I didn't tell her I stayed quite. I want to surprise her. This is a perfect day. There's no gloomy sky. But a hot and shinning sun like the summer I drove going to our destination for about half an hour. Yhanna is still asking but I'm ignoring her. I look into her face. I think she's not angry but she's hungry I gave her a dark red apple.

A moment later we arrived in our destination. After 10 minutes long of traveling from a rocky road I didn't let Yhanna eyes open.

"Just close your eyes" I command.

"Why?" She smiled w/ a little laugh.

I didn't answer her. I'm out of my car I opened the door where Yhanna sits. I supported her, her eyes still close. I put my 2 hands on her eyes as a blond fold. To make sure that she will not going to see anything.

"What is this all about, August." She said.

"You'll see."

I supported her as she walked straight when we are already in a beautiful garden, I let her speak.

"I smell different scents of flowers." She said breathing.

"Ready?"

She nodded.

I release my hands covering her two eyes. And she was totally shocked. Totally surprised. We are in a garden full of different flowers. From the different countries. Actually this is not really a garden, but a meadow I called different shops to put and add flowers on it . And I was successful.

The wind blew harder and harder wind in our hairs different emotions on Yhanna face. We smell the romantic fragrances.

This flower also has a rich history in Japan. Where it is known as "GrekkaBijin" or "Beauty under the Moon" kadupul can be found from Mexico to Venezuela, as well as Brazil. She took a long moment before she can speak.

"This is so beautiful" she whispered.

"You like it?"

"Very. I can't believe all of these things" She turned me behind and kissed me on my check "How did you that I like flowers?" She said w/ tears gently flowing on her face.

"Because whenever I'm your house I can see Myrtles everywhere and in your garden"

"Myrtles, that's the only flower I afford."

"Now" I hold her hands tightly "Beautiful flowers are everywhere. Surrounding you" whispered. And kissed her forehead. "Come" I said, leading her into a little green hay space. I get the basket full of delicious food and desserts. And a blanket covers the green grasses.

"Where did you get that?" she asked me, innocently.

"I had already prepared this" I gaze at her and gave a long lasting smile.

"You're so sweet." She whispered.

We sat on the blanket and we ate together smelling the fumes of flowers around us and we toss a wine together. After the picnic I grabbed Yhanna's hands

"Where are we going?" she asked me laughing.

"Into a single paradise"

When we are already in the place I'm calling a simple paradise she jumped because of the too much happiness. And she screamed and screamed. Like a crazy girl.

"Are you crazy?" I shouted.

"Whatever you want to call me"

She still is jumping. I see a smile on her face growing under the wider with a beautiful paradise around us. a breath taking panorama from the top of the mountain.

"I looked into her eyes so sweet"

"How much do you love?" I said

"Forever and always" She whispered.

"I can't hear"

"Forever and always" She said a little loud.

"I can't still hear"

"Forever and always" She screamed it finally "Forever and always!"

and it's my turn.

"I love you forever and always. Yhanna Rose!" I screamed.

We are now screaming our feelings for each other and their echoes are endless.

We watched the sunset through the beautiful panorama hold our hands together sitting the bed of grasses.

"I am like the rain" Yhanna whispered.

"Why?"

"I am not afraid of falling, because I know someone will catch me."

I kissed her hands.

"You know that I will catch you forever" I whispered.

I laid down my head on her limb. "Can you sing for me?"

She laughed. "What song?"

"Ah... Maybe you could sing me a lullaby"

"Are you going to sleep?"

"Excatly".

We laughed together. She sang the lullaby w/c our Mom sings to make her sleep every night.

Hold. Hold my hands together

As I sing this song forever

Watch. Watch the sun shine brighter

As we fall to each other.

Rain. Rain to feel you're warm

As I hold you with no harm

Break. Break down your fears

As I touch your face w/ tears.

(Her voice is so sweet and still continues singing.)

Hold. Hold my hands forever

As we sing this song together

Come. Come into my shoulder

As the air more became colder

Sleep. Sleep into my arms

As the rain falls into my eyes

Close. Close your teary eyes

As your head here forever lye's.

Chapter Twelve: HOSPITAL GREY

I thought everything was fine then this is me of the most memorable moment of my life. Never thought that this is also the most unforgettable one.

We decide to go home at 10 in the evening. Fine rains are falling we travel the slippery and dark road every houses are lightless. I think there's a black out in the city. The cold air soothes on my skin. I looked into Yhanna her skin was pale and shaking I get my sweater in my bag located at the backseat near and when I got it and back into my normal position she screamed. I saw an infinite white light coming briskly towards us. I turn my way to the left but it's too late. But before the dump track hit us I moved to Yhanna seat. I covered her through my body. Embracing her I feel the tears on her face and I hear she whispered me I love you.

"There's nothing bad will happen to you as long as I am here to protect you to cover you. I'm willing to die for you"

And everything was happened so fast. I smell our loved. I am not w/ my car blood. I feel the endless pain from my head going to toe. I still feel Yhanna heart beating so slow a few seconds I heard the sound of an ambulance and I pointed and I don't know what had happened next

When I opened my eyes, I can see blurred things. And I feel a dizzy. I can't move every part of my body because of the pain. But I don't care about the pain I wanna see Yhanna I wanna know if she fins.

"Yhanna" I whispered even I can't able to move my jaws.

I saw Mammoo. I heard her saying my name And Mom w/ dad. A doctor comes to check me

"He is now fine Mr. Coin" the doctor said to dad.

"Yhanna" I still whispered and I move my-self little bit.

"August don't move your wounds are still bleeding" Mammoo said.

"I don't care! Where's Yhanna? Is she fine? I wanna see her!" I forgot the pain while I am lying to get off my-self from the hospital bed. Dad called a nurse to stop me from moving. I smell my own blood again. Falling from my head even there's a bandage hey injected a calming medicine on me. And I became calm and quite for a moment I think they also injected a sleeping medicine because I feel so sleepy but I'm fighting my sleepy eyes to become wide open

A moment later, the door was opened its mom. She embraces Mammoo and Dad.

"Mom" I called her.

She walked slowly into the bed where I am laying when she's informing of me; I saw her tears still falling.

"How do you feel?" She asked.

"I am alright. Where's Yhanna?"

She didn't not answer me.

"Mom?"

And finally she answered me.

"She's in a critical condition."

I wonder why.

"No. I covered her w/ my body to make her safe. How she became critical of that?"

"We don't know" She whispered.

I'm starting to move again. The nurses came and injected me a calming medicine. I want to see Yhanna right now. What if she needed me. And I am not on her side. When they will let me go from this hospital bed. If I'm the one who will decide, I will endure my pains just to be w/ Yhanna. To hold her hand's again. I know she's the only one who can comfort me

"Mom they don't want to let me go to Yhanna's room. I want you to be there while I cannot on her side." I whispered to her and my eyes begin to close.

When I wake up, I feel her warmth again. She's holding my hands I can't believe that she's have w/ me now.

"I am fine. How are you?" Yhanna asked me.

"I don't need to feel bad because I know you're here and you're alright" I whispered kissing her hands.

"Thank you for what have you did. Thank you because your sacrifice your-self just to save me."

"Sssshh... I will do anything for you and I will die for you" She embraced me softly. I winced I winced.

"Sorry"

"So it's okay" I want to endure the pain if the reason of the suffering is the persons you loved the most. "Will you marry me?" I don't want to waste the time anymore. the moment she smiled my heart also smiled.

"Yes" She whispered. "I have you, August" She kissed my lips.

"Forever and always" I said.

In a beautiful church in Los Angeles, we held our wedding. There were 500 and more guests to witness our endless love. Including Sir Herald, Micheal, Mammoo, My bestfriends, and Specially Mom and Dad.

The church's door opened and there she was, standing straight w/ her simple weeding dress. She walks down the aisle w/ Sir Herald besides her guiding her as music begins to play. It was the background music Yhanna and I used in our ballroom dance performance. The melody and is so sweet. It can really makes you fall in love when she's w/ me I hold her hands leading her to the altar.

"We are here. Logy to witness the endless love of this two couples" the preacher said. Everyone became silent and holding their breath.

"August Coin. Do you want to take this woman as your wife?"

"I am August Coin Accepting Yhanna Rose as my Wife and as my life for richer and poorer. For joy and sadness for laughter and pain forever and always"

"Yhanna rose do you want to take this man as your husband?"

"I am Yhanna Rose. Accepting August Coin as my husband and as my life for richer and poorer for joy and sadness.For laughter and pain forever and always".

"You may now kiss the bride"

We gaze at each other.

"I love you." I whispered.

"I love you" She whispered back and kissed her lips then. And the preacher pronounced us Husband and Wife. Finally as the crowd inside the church clapped the rain falls to congratulate the newlywed.

I'm awake by an infinite cold and realize that the weddings not real. Our weddings not real it was just only a dream. I wished I hadn't opened my eyes.

I hear sudden cries. I turn my gaze to find who's crying I finally saw them. My bestfriends, Francis, Brett, and Tiffany, James, Carmeo, John, And Emy.There's no such Smiles on their faces. Only tears falling from their eyes.

"What's your tears about" I wonder.

A long break passed us by I asked them again but they're speechless. Until the door of my room opened, I saw my mother with Mammoo. Coming near at me I recognize they were also in tears. And this time fears are with me. Fears that I never felt before.

"Mom? Why you're all crying?" I said but they were quite for the rest of the moment. "Mom I'm okay I wanna see Yhanna"

"August... Yhanna's is rest." Mammoo whispered.

Her tears began to fall.

"It's fine I wanna see her sleeping" I said.

"No she's not sleeping" Mammoo said.

"She died." Mom Comforts me.

I want to laugh. This is not true, this is not real like the dream I dreamed. Yhanna is still alive. I know they are Crying to me.

"No you're Both lying to me!"No!' I scream. I forced my-self to get down on bed. Never minding the dextrose still attached on my arms. I don't care if I bleed again I wanted to go to Yhanna room and see her fine. A moment there are 4 nurses who stopped me and injects me a calming medicine. Just a few seconds I cannot fight anymore. I've no strength.

"Please..." I whispered "Let me see her" and the light was swallowed by the dark.

EPILOUGE:

Three days after Yhanna's burial, I found myself in her room. Gently lookin around. I now miss her so much. I miss being with her. Her touch and her breath. Her innocent scent.

"She loves you." Mom said behind me.

I take a breath cause my tears wanted to fall from my eyes. Mom bowed down her head an left md alone in Yhanna's room. She knew that I wanted to be alone for the moment. In this moment. Right here.

When I'm holding my tears back, I noticed a paper lying on the rough floor. I picked it up and I recognize that it was a letter. A familiar handwrite. It was Yhanna's letter for me.

I slowly open and start to read it.

My Sweetest and Dearest August,

Hi! You made me feel how precious I am. More than a gem stones. More than diamonds and golds. You loved me for who I am, not who I was. I thought you'll leave me alone when hard time comes. Thank you so much for loving me. For being with me. For all the thing you've done for me. I'll stay and I will be always on your side as long as I could. Even death can't take us apart.

August, thank you for the moments we've shared in those beautiful times. Forever that I will be yours and you are forever mine. I love you, until I die.

Forever with you,

Yhanna Rose

PS: I LOVE YOU AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THE SIMPLE THINGS WE HAD.

As I read the letter, the memories are flashing back to me. All of those simple moments. All of those simple times. And all of those simple things. The memories of her. The memories of me.

The first time that I saw her. She introduced herself infront of the class and sat beside me. She given me a beautiful smile.

The feelings that I never felt before when we're practicing the dance.

The moment that my heart really admit that I'm inlove with her. We're dancing. She's beautiful. And I told her that I love her, but there's a flow of confusion in her eyes.

I apologized with that.

And through the rain, I had my first kiss and she became mine.

I left when hate was all I felt. I left her. Like I didn't care so much about her.

But I return again and still can't hide the love I felt for her. I love her, more than words.

She sing me a song while we're watching the panorama view.

I finished reading her letter. I cried. I felt her kiss on my cheek. It was impossible. She's kissing. I feel it. I know she doesn't want me crying. I cleared those tears in my eyes for her.

For the girl I always wanted to be with, I love you so much more than you could love me. Your memories will never fade in my mind. I'll never lost you in this heart of mine. You changed my whole being and I'm really greatful because you came here with me. To show how beautiful life is. To light up my world and gave me hope and strength, to face all the fears in my life. You're always with me so that I would never feel alone. You opened my eyes that there's a lot of things in this world that are simple but really ignites and truly beautiful.

Thank you and I love you for giving me joy.

Because of you, I realized the importance and beauty of THE SIMPLE THINGS in our life.
