Story One – Deck 20

"Qevon, breakfast."

A dull hum filled the otherwise silent household. Thick walls killed the concerto of myriad extractor fans. No house, not even the poorest houses, were without computerised utilities. The city was a sprawling networked hive of freezers, vacuum cleaners and light switches. Waste heat was sucked from the circuit boards and pumped around the tower block to be reused where needed.

A criss-cross of wires hid beneath the skin of the walls; carrying power and communication between the nodes, the human conveniences, that covered an entire planet of metal towers and walkways.

Footsteps thumped erratically down the hallway. That wasn't Qevon. Crannor lay down his cutlery and peered out into the hallway. The door of the master bedroom swung shut and bounced against its frame. He shouted to his son again.

The toast popped up. A golden brown hue to the bread indicating it was perfectly ready to receive the butter. Crannor poured the coffee and grabbed the butter. He shouted out again to Qevon. The reply was the noise of aeroplane engines that children make.

NEE-AM! Qevon grasped a plastic spaceship that flashed with red and blue lights. The plastic toy bleeped as it landed next to a cereal bowl.

"Starship Belar 3 reporting for breakfast," Qevon announced.

"Lucky Asteroids or Honey Planets?" Crannor asked.

"Can I have both?"

"Eh..." Crannor puffed, "sure." He lifted the box of Asteroids and began to pour.

"Let me do it, let me do it. I can do it, watch," said Qevon as he grabbed the cereal box from his father.

"Where's mum?" Crannor asked his son.

"Don't know," Qevon replied. "Shower," it was more of a statement than a question although Crannor guessed his son didn't know. Crannor stammered for something to say but he didn't know either. He suspected she had just come home. A whiff of gin lingered in the hallway.

Qevon poured from the Honey Planets box while holding his starship in the other hand. He purred with engine noises.

"Come on, stop. Just pour it normally. Did you not hear mum leave the bathroom?" Crannor said all at once.

"I'm getting changed," a barely audible voice shouted through from the bedroom.

"Your toast is getting cold," he shouted back.

"I'll make some more."

"Can't you just eat it now? We can't afford to keep wasting food, I chucked half of the leftovers this morning. The vegetables were black."

No response came.

"Daddy..." Qevon spoke in the way he did when he wanted to ask a difficult question.

"Yes, Qevon?"

"How many stars are there? Hundreds?"

"There are many, many stars. Too many to count."

"More than a hundred thousand hundred hundred?"

"I'm sure of it."

"Hasn't someone tried to count them all?"

"Yes, some have tried but you can never quite get them all. We do know that there are more stars in the sky than there are people on this planet."

"Daddy, do you have to work today" the words were chewed with the breakfast cereal.

"Qevon, don't speak with your mouth full. Yes, daddy has to go to work today. There have been a lot of malfunctions with the machines in our district and it's daddy's job to find out why."

"What sort of machines, daddy? And why can't they fix themselves so you can stay at home."

"Sometimes they can, Qevon, but it isn't always possible. The machines are government owned machines. They monitor the districts; cleaning up and sometimes carrying out repair work. But they aren't sophisticated enough to fix all problems, especially not their own internal problems. The machines can perform a self-diagnostic apply patches from the government's central node but sometimes that just isn't enough. When that happens my team is called in to solve the problems."

Qevon spooned another mouthful of cereal and mumbled something about going out to play with Keth on the lower decks.

"I don't want you anywhere near deck 20, tell Keth he has to comes up if he wants to play. It isn't safe down there. Make sure you stay within the tower, Qevon, there are plenty of places to play inside. Are you listening to me? Qevon? The lower levels are dangerous, I don't want you down there."

Qevon scratched at his arm. Angry red patches of skin covered both forearms and the inside of each elbow. The summer months were the worst for irritation. Crannor noticed the scratch marks around the bump Qev's ID chip was hidden.

"Do I have to keep it, dad?"

"It's for the best, son. Remember when grandad was ill and his chip alerted us to his condition? The chip's sensors tripped the alarm, and let us knew he was in trouble. It saved his life."

Qevon scratched his chip with renewed vigour, but finally relented. He conceded that his dad was correct. Everyone had to have a chip. Why does it have to be so itchy?

Crannor eyed the clock on the fridge again, "I need to leave. Remember, no lower than level 21 and don't go further than the next tower, and stay away from Red areas. The Reds don't look after their neighbourhoods, and they don't look after their children." He kissed Qevon on the head then grabbed his jacket. "Love you honey, love you Qevon. We'll hang out when I'm back from work, doesn't that sound great"

"Love you dad."

The apartment door slid open between breaths, the house computer system bade Crannor good day. As soon as his feet were clear of the opening the door slammed shut. Crannor's heart raced everytime he had to take the induction lift. There was no way of knowing what robot calamities he would encounter in his line of work. Entering the lift was often just the start of another crazy day.

He mentally counted his data pads and power tools; main laser torch, fine torch, insulation spray, left pocked datapad, right arm compdevice, powerbelt, traction boots, carry box... and a few more items he picked up but couldn't remember. He could feel a sharp point from something that hung at his waist but he couldn't see what it was.

Once inside the induction lift his boots sealed to the floor. The lift dropped faster than gravity would allow. Crannor gritted his teeth and curled his toes.

The lift door opened. It has plummeted eighteen stories in the blink of an eye. Crannor exited and walked towards the Express Port. 'Shuttle 1312, upper platform,' he mumbled inaudibly bumping his way through the crowd.

His eyes fixed upon the shiny metal walls of the vast lobby, his sight cut through the bustling crowd to look upon his green and cleanly shaven face. Mirrors had a way of drawing attention to themselves like nothing else could.

Goggles! Crannor just remembered they were in his back-pack. This pair was recently upgraded with a new processor and increased databank.

'Good morning Crannor. Power levels: two days remaining. Charge soon.' The words flicked in front of his eyes. 'Shuttle 1312 is on time, you must walk faster. Suggestion to increase step rate by 5%.'

Crannor hurried but found himself distracted, 'Great new products just in, picked especially for you by our human specialists. Would you like to view our power wrenches now?' An ad-blimp passed Crannor as part of its pre-programmed circuit around the station. His goggles were able to access the blimp's diagnostics; the owner's logo projected on his lenses with a run-down of the blimp's status. Power level high. Uptime 508 days. Owned: Til Corp.

Crannor's neck whipped back as a stout man shouldered his way past. Cran broke his concentration with the advert to rub his neck. "Fucking Red," he muttered.

The thickset shoulders turned towards Cran. A chest-beating pose suggested danger. It was soon followed by an untranslatable roar of expletives.The two of them stood eye to eye. Heads almost touching. Pupil-less goggles staring deep in one another.

"Watch where you're going," Cran declared then turned to walk away. The stranger grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back. Cran's tools rattled and his legs protested at the awkward force from twisting.

"How about I cut those green lips of yours and make them "fucking red"?"

The 1312 shuttle came into view. It slowed as it pulled into the station. A warning sounded in Cran's goggles. 'Late! Hurry now! Shuttle departure imminent.'

"Your system clock is broken," Crannor said to the stranger. In the moment that the man looked down at his watch Cran ran past him and headed for the nearest carriage.

Qevon poked the last of his soggy breakfast cereal. There was more milk than flakes. He didn't enjoy it when it was too wet, yet he knew that when he poured the milk to the brim.

His plastic spaceship sat on the table next to the self-cooling milk canister. Its silence called to him, 'play with me'. The spoon fell lifeless and downed in the bowl. Qevon grabbed the ship and ran around the kitchen table screaming like an afterburner. The ship's engines lit up as it flew through the air.

Morning light finally creaked through the kitchen windows. Beads of rain coalesced and dropped onto the sills. Heat and humidity was the worst combination for Qevon's skin; the sensation was that of something twisting and turning around deep inside the muscle.

A short electronic pulse indicated it was half past the hour. Qevon stiffened. He hated the sound of alarm clocks, the noise was so frightening that he was afraid to even touch them. The first time he ever set an alarm, for the reason of curiosity and fun, had forced his dad to burst into his bedroom and rescue Qev from the blaring sound. Under the covers Qevon hid, stiff with fear. His heart quickened again yet the pulse was over. The red digits on the fridge displayed 08:30.

Fortunately the ship's crew survived the turbulence and the ship was gliding around the room again. Qev ran to the window and peered out onto the harsh metallic streets of Terosan. The city-planet's skies were clear today, Qev peered out across the jungle of monoliths. Only by looking upwards was it possible to catch a glimpse of the sky, in every other direction all he could see was other towers like the one in which he lived. Down here at this level there wasn't much variety in day-to-day scenery. If you were lucky you could see up to a maximum of four or five blocks away, but without fail your gaze would end upon another building.

The walkways below were the unreachable highways of deck 20. There was no way he could go down there without getting into trouble. Marching, walking, riding; people flowed like water from tower to tower. Where were they all going he wondered. Shopping or meeting friends, he reasoned, perhaps some were working as his dad was. Despite his father forbidding him from going to deck 20 he couldn't help feel enticed to visit. He could see children playing. It can't be that bad, can it? They were laughing and screaming. Hopping, jumping, running; in and out, round and round. Plastic spaceships, hover boards, magballs; everyone played by different rules but everyone played together.

Forget staying inside, those kids were having too much fun. Qevon rushed to his room and rummaged through a pile of clothes. He was changed and out in the door in such a rush that the spaceship was left behind on the bed.

"Going out to play. Bye!" Qevon shouted to his mother. No reply was heard. She must be engaged in the net again. He pushed the door to his parent's bedroom ajar, he peered in and saw her reclining in a computer chair. The family was poor but unlike most families at this stratum they had managed to salvage a second chair-pod thanks to Crannor's repair skills.

The goggled helm covered his mother's eyes and ears. A blaring sound emanated from the helm's earphones; the latest pay-per-month blaster no doubt. Her gloves twitched every time an enemy player shot at her. With each death her voice filled the room with excited profanity; sometimes winning, sometimes losing. It didn't seem to matter which, her tone was the same. On the floor lay a wet discarded towel a hair's breadth away from the drying rack. Qevon grabbed the towel and slung it over the heated pipes.

"Going out," Qevon shouted.

"Ok!" she replied at least. Qevon closed the door. "Be safe," she shouted just as the door clicked.

Soon after leaving Qevon decided to ignore his father's advice and go place with the kids on deck 20. Most of the rush-time crowds had past. As he exited the lift he realised that he'd left behind the spaceship. He dug into his pockets found a scrunched up magball mit. Perhaps the others would let them join their game. He didn't recognise anyone, perhaps they went to a local school down here on deck 20?

"Qev!" a familiar voice called on him. Qevon couldn't see where the voice was coming from. "Qevon!" the voice shouted again. It was Keth. There he was, on the other side of the game waving his hands. "Come on, we need another player." Keth stood a half-head taller and was notably broader than the other kids who played magball. Keth was yellow-skinned, just as half of the other kids were yellow. A couple of them were red while the rest were green like Qevon.

Keth kicked the ball to another team mate and continued to play without getting an answer from Qevon. The ball blasted past Qevon's face as he stood counting the number of players. He was working out if he could join; the last time he joined a game the teams had an uneven number of players and everyone started to whine about what was fair. It wasn't fun and no one could agree whether Qevon could play or not. Entering a game required majority approval. A few shouts of acceptance followed and the ball and Qev joined Keth's team. As soon as he joined the ball whizzed past him again and hit the 4-point post.

"Come on, we're 10 points down." Keth shouted.

A green skinned kid, a few years older than Qevon, threw the ball high in the air towards another green skinned kid at the other end of the public walkway. These two must be on Keth's team, he reasoned. The ball missed its target and bounced then rolled under the feet of adults who walked on by. Eventually, the ball emerged from the crowd as another adult kicked the ball back into play.

Keth now had the ball; he punched it higher than ever before. The ball was caught in a gust of that ripped between the towers, it drifted aimlessly but managed to land near in the opponent's half. Keth didn't always think, he acted first and always played rough. Aldon, another boy that Qev recognised, was playing on the other team and had just picked up the ball.

"Pass"

"Pass it"

"Here! Over here! Pass!"

"Me, me, to me!"

Keth to Qevon, then back again. Interception. Aldon to another boy, then back again. Interceped. Keth had the ball again. Once more the ball soared towards the edge of the walled walkway, if it could fly over the edge of the railing it would be lost to somewhere 20 levels below; however, the the ball stopped impossibly fast against an invisible wall that extended upwards from the walkway's railing. Energy barriers prevented objects from being knocked or thrown off. A safety feature devised from humanity's trial and errors of building larger and more highly interconnected structures. At first it seemed stuck but then the ball rolled down the barrier as if rolling through honey.

"Here, it's our ball." Keth shouted to Aldon who has been the first to the barrier. Technically the ball was out of bounds so play had to stop.

"No it isn't. You kicked it," Aldon shouted back.

"It came off Sel's leg," Artoc complained.

"It didn't touch me," Sellicia rebuked. Qevon paused to stare at Sellicia. A girl, playing magball. Girls don't play magball, do they? Her light green hair swished as she turned and ran towards Aldon. She kicked the ball and in that moment decided the state of play. Qevon was motionless. He couldn't speak or watch the ball come straight at him. He was staring at Sellicia. There was something about her. He didn't have the words for it. Crunch! Qev's eyes were forced shut as the impact felt like a burning sensation across his face.

He brought a palm to his face and felt his eyes well up. Sore, but not sore enough to cry. He regretted not paying attention to the game and looking like a fool in front of everyone. Qev dropped to one knee and covered his face. He was dazed. As soon as he crouched low the other team scored.

"I'm not playing," Artoc threw his hands up, "you guys cheated."

"No! No we didn't." Monor shouted back.

"It's my ball," Artoc tried to add credibility in the way that only a child would try.

"Yeah, but it's my generator," another added. The generator helped to keep the ball within the area of play, and also linked up the point posts in order to keep track of the score. Qev hadn't recognised the voice, he managed to open his eyes and look around to see who was arguing. He saw Keth stand in front of red-skinned boy of similar height but slimmer build.

Keth then looked at Sellica, "you kicked the ball before we decided who had the ball." More high-pitched shouting ensued but Qev had lost track of what was going on. He sat down at the side and covered his throbbing cheeks and nose.

Many of the passing adults looked on with disdain but said nothing. The arguments were heated but voices carried far across the open deck.

Qevon rolled back the sleeves of his jacket and scratched his arms. The heat and humidity combined with the stress of the game was forcing him to itch. The embedded ID chip was implanted only a week ago. All kids in his class as school received them at the same time. The week before they all wore biometric encoded ankle straps.

His skin shone red where he had scratched. He clenched his teeth and tried to fight the thought of scratching more. Qev looked back towards the magball game and saw Keth land a punch on green-skinned boy on the other team. A fury of kicks and punches ignited between the two. Within a few breaths of time passing more kids had joined the fray. Punching and kicking was just the beginning; it was followed by hair pulling, biting, scratching, elbowing and other forms of petty fighting. Qev noted that Sellicia had stood back out of harm's way.

Two dark-blue uniformed police troopers encroached upon the fighting children. Helmets on; visors down. Their well-shaven chins gleamed from beneath the visors. A green and a yellow set of lips were revealed gritted teeth from both officers. Rail guns holstered. Stun batons covered. An outstretched glove protruded into the crowd of fighting children and grabbed someone around the shoulder, but Qevon couldn't see who.

"Desist!" the officer shouted before emitting a short pulse from siren on his wrist. It reminded Qevon of his alarm clock. He froze in terror and his covered his ears. The alarm was only momentary but he felt the need to shut his eyes until the fighting stopped.

Keth approached, his lips were burst and his cheeks bruised, despite this he smiled ear-to-ear. Keth loved fighting; he was bigger and stronger than most other kids. It was like nothing had happened, the other kids followed behind Keth and gathered next to Qevon. Chatter resumed and the officers disappeared back into the crowds.

A red-skinned boy from the other team produced a clear piece of plastic film from his pocket and slapped it against the walkway barricade.

"What's that?" Qevon asked as he looked up from his crouched position. The film stuck without slipping.

"Polyfilm, obviously. My brother showed me how to etch my name into it. We covered a wall on that tower with jokes," the boy pointed west towards a faraway tower.

Qevon stood up to look at the polyfilm, but couldn't see it. He ran a finger over the clear film. He could barely see it and the texture provided no grip for his finger. When the sun stuck the film just right the dark coloured wall shimmered unnaturally; it was the only way to see the film.

"How are you supposed to read it?" Qevon asked.

"You need goggles, but to write on it you need an etching pen," the boy answered.

"I have an etching pen," Sellicia announced and stepped forward. She produced the pen from her pocket and began to write over the newly placed polyfilm. "You don't need goggles but it helps. The words shine when you wear the goggles."

"We should all put our names on the deck's wall," Keth said.

"Nah, we'll get caught," Aldon said, "need to go behind a wall... or somewhere quiet..."

"The walls of the Express Port," Sellicia beamed with her suggestion.

"But that's dwn on level 10," Qev whimpered. He knew his father would disapprove.

"It's fine, I've been down before," she boasted.

"Me too," Keth added. Qevon looked at his friend's raised eyebrows, he suspected that was a lie.

Moments later the crowd of kids from the magball game filled the bank of elevators and descended to deck 10. A few had flaked off and gone home but at least eight remained. Qevon, Keth, Sellicia, Aldon, Monor, Artoc and a few more exited on to deck 10. The fighting had been completely forgotten by now. Qevon discovered that the red-skinned boy with the polyfilm was Sandar, an older boy from the same academy.

A shuttle accelerated and escaped from sight. The Express Port quietened just after the train left. Clear plas-walls separated the monorail from the crowded walkway. Dozens and dozens of adults had gathered on the platform waiting for the next train. So far the kids hadn't been noticed. Many adults read news on their datapads or stared into space.

"Look the plas-walls are covered in polyfilm," Keth pointed out. Myriad strips of polyfilm littered the clear wall of the shuttle tube. A criss-cross lattice of defaced film made it almost impossible to read what anyone had written. "Give me the pen," Keth demanded. Sandar obliged.

"What are you writing?" Artoc asked.

"Keth was here," Keth laughed.

Sandar grabbed the pen then added his own name, he wrote on one of the polystrips which was already there. Sellicia followed, then Monor. Keth decided to write his name twice more. Despite this hive of activity none of the passers-by seemed to notice. Not even a grumble. Nothing. They pushed past each other on the walkways then stood frozen on the platforms.

Some others loitered with no aspiration to do anything or go anywhere. Qev wondered if these were the people his dad warned about. A small group of people dressed in rags sat in a dark and secluded area behind one of the plas-tunnels. 'Watch out of the homeless on deck 10' his father had once warned. Not that his father had ever expected him to be down here.

The free-roaming litter, dirty walkways and dank air from the Express Port created a feeling

of unease. No light shone from the darkened passageways where the homeless hid. It seemed obvious that the hanging lightstrips needed to be replaced, yet they looked old as if though they hadn't been attended to for years.

"Qev, write your name," Keth extended a hand and offered a pen, "come on, you won't get caught."

Qevon reluctantly grabbed the pen and rushed a quick scribble at the nearest section of wall.

"Hey!" An angry voice shouted across the walkway. Qevon drove the pen into a jacket pocket. He wondered how anyone had seen him, he thought he had been quick enough to avoid getting caught. As he hid the pen in his jacket he looked over to where the voice had come from. A group of teenagers approached. Most of them yellow and green-skinned youths with a near even mix of male and female.

"What ya doin' here?" one of the them shouted. Another from the group laughed.

"Leave them Kam," said one of the females.

"Writing on our walls, are you?" Kam said," That's our wall and you kids don't have a right to come here and write on our walls. You understand? Only we can write on our walls."

"Nah, wasn't us," Keth blurted defensively, "was already written on before we got here."

"We can write on our walls, but not you."

"Kam, just let them be," the same female voice as before. A few of the males ignored the advice and converged upon the Keth and the others. Qevon cowered tight against the wall and began to itch at his arms again.

"Yeah, just let us be," Keth said.

"Shut up!" Qevon shouted at Keth.

Kam grabbed Keth by the collar and pulled him to stare eye-to-eye. Shouting and swearing gushed from Kam's mouth, and it was the first time that Qev had seen Keth look scared. Qevon clenched his legs together. Monor ran towards the elevators in the tower lobby but no one else followed.

Qev scratched again and then felt an odd ripping sensation in his arm. He looked down and saw his biochip covered in blood and lying on the floor. He covered the wound and held it tightly closed.

"Your chip," Sellicia pointed, "you better put it back in or they'll think you're dead."

"What are you two talking about?" one of the teens next to Kam shouted over. He came and stood over the pair of them, "Stop talking! you've no chance of escaping now, you better give us all your money and we'll let you walk away."

Unknowingly the newcomer had stood on Qev's biochip and crushed it. Sellicia gasped and Qevon welled up with tears. The central system of Terosan would detect that Qevon had just died. At least that's what the computer would naively conclude. Before either he or she could reply the teen had grabbed Sellicia by the hair. She screamed in pain and stumbled backwards.

"Stop!" A voice from nowhere shouted above the noise of the fray. A large red arm passed near Sellicia's face. The grip on her hair had loosed and she looked up to see a stout red-skinned man pushing the teen away from her. This man had grabbed the teen by the neck and began to shout at him. Another teen tried to punch the would-be hero but failed to connect.

"Police!" Sellicia shouted. Four officers ran down the walkway with rail-pistols in hand. In an instant it was over. The group of teens dispersed but laughed as they ran away.

Qevon screamed as the red-skinned man crashed to the solid walkway floor. Red blood oozed from the cracked red skin. A round hole had been made in the man's skull.

"No!" Sellicia shouted and waved her arms. She cried along with Qevon as they saw that the police had shot the man who had come to their rescue.

The officers had escorted the children home and Qevon was taken straight to hospital to have his biochip replaced. Crannor arrived at the hospital but was so relieved that he overlooked the fact that Qevon had ignored his rules.

Qevon wailed in his father's arms, "he saved us dad, he saved and he was the one who died."

"I know son, I know." Crannor replied as he held his son tightly.

Chapter Two – Fallen Gods of Cheam

Ice, it's everywhere. Ice, it's even where you don't see. Snow is everything that isn't ice. Vistas of ice, rocks and mountains, between plateaus of snow. Cheamian landscapes never differ. The further south you go the more it snows. Cool winds whip across the lands, through the valleys of white, up and over the rocks of grey. Darkened greens huddle together where the ice stops and before the rocky peaks begin; the wooded areas are few yet evergreen – brown legs coated in white powder.

The village of Fjatlos sat high on the sheltered face of a rocky mountain overlooking Five Glacier Valley. A string of mountains met around a valley of glaciers, the sea of ice-packed structures flowed down the from the rocky saddles and gathered in the basin as a culmination known as the Fjatlos Basin. The village dwellings were high above the basin carved into the peaty hillside, the wooden frames buried deep into the ground. Steep walls stood taller than man, from which snow wound slide and fall without hindrance. Each building stood apart to let the snows flow freely by, the snow could be the downfall of any dweller yet snow provided the necessary insulation for life.

Tallest of all buildings was the church, rising up taller than the village hall, yet not as tall as the melt-water collector. The collectors were life-giving tall wooden structures that channelled fresh snow from the ridge that collected the water in metal buckets. Even in conditions as rough as Cheam it was easy for people to forget what kept them alive. Danger focussed the mind but everyone needs rest, everyone forgets about the natural mechanisms of life.

Life was only possible in Fjatlos due to the natural heat from the mountain fissures that provided the warmth needed to change the ice into water. The Fire Caves hide a source of pure hot water that drips and collects in the depths of the caverns. A labyrinth of tunnels hides the pools of water beneath the hills.

"Istelle, Istelle! Get back in here. You'll freeze to death," the voice of Sedron's wife carried in the wind. Sedron turned his head to watch his wife and ran after their daughter Istelle.

"I'm fine mother, look I can run," Istelle called back. Sedron was glad to see his daughter was up and running around again. Fever had wracked her body and took her to the edge of death. 'Please not again', they pleaded with death not to take another child, they had lost enough offspring. It didn't feel like such a long time since they lost an older daughter to fever.

"Istelle!" her mother called.

"Mama, there's no wind, mama. I can run and run."

"Get your furs on, now. Don't let your father see you like this."

A hand grabbed Istelle from behind and dropped a thick fur garb over her head. "Careful young wolf, even the bravest hunter wear their furs," Sedron spoke clearly to his daughter.

"Ugh! Dad," Istelle resisted, "it isn't even cold." She tried to slip away from his hug.

"It is cold, young woman, and you will wear your furs." Istelle freed herself and ran away along the frozen muddy pathways of the village. The white-grey wolf cloak trailed behind her. It hung half over one shoulder but didn't quite fit. This cloak belonged to her brother who was lost on a village hunt.

"Get away from the edge," Istelle's mother called, "tell her Sedron!"

"She sees it, she won't run over the edge." he shouted back.

"Sedron! I'm not losing another child this year."

Sedron grumbled, he wouldn't let the past haunt the future. If he always dwelt on the kids already lost then he could not celebrate the three kids that remained. Four gone, but three still survive. The world was harsh and unforgiving, he was reminded of this every morning. Why did life exist on such a frigid world? Sedron tried not to ask himself, the thoughts of his own mortality and limited existence drove him to dark places. The mind was sharp when cold, but clarity was lost when the mind was left to dwell.

Istelle ran to the edge of Skull Cliff, her mother shouted again, but Sedron hadn't moved. 'Why is called Skull Cliff?' Istelle had asked her father when she was younger. So young, so naive. How to explain the bones in the valley? Not to a child, you can't explain the bones to a child. The bones are from unwanted children, bastards, and cripples. When the babies' cries stop, the parents start. Villages elders are at least given a choice: the dignity of a swift execution or the option of leaving to wilderness with a sharp blade. Life is tough and food is scarce. The gods have forsaken this world. Ice. Snow. Ice. Snow. Ice and then more damned snow. Oh, why can't it be warm?

Istelle's laughter and screams of joy filled the air as she ran with friends around the village. The other parents watched with just as much concern. Life was dangerous and everyone has lost a sibling, parent, or child in recent memory.

"See, she's fine," Sedron said as he sat down to sharpen his iron spear. He shrugged his large round shoulders and took a piece of flint from his pocket. Everything was fine, he told himself.

"Troubles at home?" A voice called from behind. Sedron didn't rise to the bait. His brother laughed then came to sit beside him. Alfron was taller and more muscular, yet had a poorer aim and wasn't as nimble on his feet. Just behind Alfron were two more men, each followed by a leashed wolf, and behind them were Alfron's two teenage sons Fomel and Kebber. "Almost time for hunting, are you ready?" Sedron heard the footsteps of the other men but hadn't bother to turn and greet them. One of the wolves had come to Sedron's familiar smell, it licked his face then sat by his feet. "Deaf or just ignorant, Sedron?"

Sedron smirked. "The spear won't sharpen itself."

The seven hunters dressed alike in white-grey skins that matched the wolves they walked with. Collective barks came from the wolves who had turned their attention to a snowfox running by, they yanked themselves against their leashes in a vain attempt to pursue. The hunters pulled the leashes tight leading to a collective yelp from the wolves.

"Easy now," Alfron clapped his pet.

The tip of Sedron's spear was sharp enough to cut with the slightest touch. Sedron rose and eyeballed his fellow huntsmen. He said nothing. Everyone knew each other, this hunt would be routine. No mistakes. No unnecessary deaths. No children to bury, not this time. "Pray for my return, we shall feast when I return. The lands shall be rife with meat now that the winds have gone." Sedron addressed his wife.

"Sedron," Welyn called out to him but suddenly couldn't find the tell him how much he meant to her. He had to survive, she didn't know how she could last if there was another death in the family. Worst of all if Sedron died her pillar in life was gone. She tried to smile but her eyes fell to the ground, her mind wandered into a dream of days long gone. "Sedron, I shall pray for your return. Please be careful. No heroics..." she looked to the rest of the huntsmen, "from any of you."

"Sedron!" Elsar shouted. "No time for kissing, let's get hunting."

Snow crunched under the feet of the hunting party as they started their march away from Sedron's house. The wolves rushed alongside; darting out and back with eagerness.

Cotyr looked back to see if Sedron had moved, "By gods man... you are in no hurry." The wind howled yet the sun still shone. Sedron kissed his wife goodbye, he uttered something to her that no one else could hear.

"We shall return with a feast for the whole village," Sedron announced to all. By now, the rest of the village had come out to wave farewell to their hopeful hunters. May the hunt be prosperous they shouted after the men.

"Or to an irate wife if you fail," Alfron laughed.

"Careful brother or she will have your wolf for our next stew." Sedron finally left by kissing Istelle goodbye. His other children remained inside. He mumbled a prayer to the gods that should this party fail then they must look after his wife and children, even his eldest and moodiest child. Cerrun wouldn't listen to his father, he had no drive to do anything with life. How does a parent encourage a child to live when the child will not listen to reason? Every suggestion is wrong, every bit of help ignored. 'Be safe' Sedron whispered to the wind.

"Gods of wind, of fire, of land and water, of trees and of men, hear my prayer. Give me strength to hunt and see that my spear will fly straight and true, give me courage in the face of fear and deliver me from danger. I ask this prayer to be heard "O' Gods above, watch over us this day." Alfron said aloud.

Ilkand, their father, never left the village without prayer and he had raised his own sons to be both respectful to the gods and dutiful to the village. No chief was fairer or greater in skill. Sedron long wished to emerge from his father's shadow, but even in the old man's death, few can see the potential that shines from Sedron. 'Ilkand the great, Ilkand the wise, the generous, the fair, the master.' Sedron had grown tired of his father's legacy such that he had come to revel in the folklore of Magnar, a man that some say was even greater than Ilkand. It was he that wrestled wolves and brought home the first tamed wolf to the village. Magnar lost an eye but continued to hunt. Magnar lost a hand but continued to rule. Many say that Sedron, and Ilkand, were descended from Magnar the legendary chief of Fjatlos.

What made Ilkand so loved was not just his successful hunting strategies but his patience and fair handedness in resolving disputes. It was not uncommon for rival villages to come to him and ask for adjudication of their disputes. A man who loved to walk and climb alone, as much as he loved to hunt with the other men from the village. A quiet man who was fierce in battle yet bore no grudges and was slow to temper. He was Ilkand the loved.

Sedron had planned out the route the party would take, as master of the hunt he set the pace and chose to lead them north across the ridge and away from Five Glacier Valley. Over to the backside of the mountain and then northwards past the evergreen forests. The hilly region beyond the flatlands to the north should prove fertile this time of year, away from all the villages of man.

The untouched setting, beyond the flatlands, allowed animals to roam wild and free. Kills should be plentiful, but it was not without danger. His father always instructed his parties to cross the snowy expanse as fast as possible, only the biggest and toughest creatures would roam there but their maw could cut a man in two with ease. Sharp claws that could penetrate the skull, front to back, in a single swipe. Such creatures that stood tall as a church and could run as fast as any wolf, but their meat was poisonous and foul his father had warned. Sedron never figured out how his father could know that.

As a child Sedron heard stories from his grandfather of the equatorial flats far in the south. Vast icy deserts with untouched snow that was so soft and thick that no one dared cross them. No shelter or food, so it would be impossible to cross even if anyone dared. 'Was there no rocks there grandfather?' Sedron had asked. He never did get an answer to that. 'Couldn't it be crossed in a sledge?' Sedron had asked another time, 'no, too far.'

Before the hunters would cross the flats Sedron checked that all members still followed. Elsar, Cotyr, Alfron and his sons Fomel and Kebber. Sedron counted six; two more than he would have liked. The boys would be more of hindrance than a help. 'It's not an easy hunt, boys, perhaps it would be best to go back.' Sedron had warned them but Alfron pleaded to let them come. They had to learn how to hunt one day.

Fomel wheezed with each gust of wind which further entrenched Sedron's resentment as he heard his nephew struggle to match his pace. "Slow down Sedron," Alfron had barked, at least twice now, but Sedron would not listen. Alfron had also complained of aching feet and muscle cramps, but Sedron ignored it. He was determined to hunt, and bringing home any sack of meat smaller than he was would be a failure. 'The sleds must be piled high,' he warned. No turning back until we have filled our sacks.

"My feet are aching. I must rest, Sedron," Alfron shouted above the howls of the wind. One of his skis had become lodged into a mound of snow and threw his body to the floor. Even the wolves were tiring and the sky was now darkening. It was time to rest. Sedron accepted and came to sit beside Alfron.

"Are you injured?" he asked Alfron.

"I'm fine, just a little bruised but it's nothing," Alfron said.

"We should try making the crossing before nightfall."

"We won't make it. It's too far."

"I'm hungry," Cotyr interrupted.

"It isn't too far," Sedron replied to Alfron, "we'll make it. I've done this before."

"I've done it before too and you know it's too far," Alfron said.

"Can we eat already?" Cotyr shouted. He stood above the two brothers still waiting for resolution.

"Hey! Did you just see that?" Elsar shouted. He was the last to join the commotion. Alfron's sons had joined him on the snow but kept quiet while the adults bickered.

"Let's make camp here, it would be better just to rest." Alfron said.

"Here? You moron, we can't just stop here. Where is here? Here is nowhere. There's no shelter, no wood, no anything," Sedron rebutted.

"We should move on then," Cotyr agreed and pointed towards the far end of the flatlands.

"There!" Elsar shouted, "there it was again. Did you see that?"

"What are you talking about?" Sedron turned to see what Elsar was looking at. "I don't see anything. Now let's just get our stuff and get to the other side."

"I saw it... it was like a star falling from the sky," said Cotyr.

"Cotyr, you're hungry. You don't know what which way is up when you're hungry," Sedron shouted back.

"No, look, there. It happened again. Whatever it was, it fell again." Elsar said.

"It was a falling star. I've seen it twice now." Cotyr added.

"Gods have mercy," Alfron said.

"I can assure you that the sky is not falling down." Sedron said, he looked around for the mysterious falling stars. "It was a meteor. Nothing more. Now let's get going before night falls."

"We should see where they land. Maybe they bring gold?" Elsar asked.

Cotyr laughed. "Gods don't have a use for gold."

"There!" Elsar shouted. He pointed at the series of falling red stars falling. Everyone was watching Sedron who now stood at the edge of disbelief; his mouth agape. They had all seen the falling stars now.

"This is a bad omen, brother," Alfron said.

The wolves seemed the most apprehensive, they whined and wagged their tails profusely. Another three stars fell, red pinpoints of light, bursting into life in an instant then disappearing just as quickly. All occurrences happened in the same region of sky. It had to be a meteor shower, Sedron told himself. The day was passing through the twilight into the night.

The stars no longer fell but the sky had darkened, the clouds were thicker, miasmic and grey. Sedron lead the team forward. 'I must not show fear, they will not follow if I cannot lead. There is no need to fear, for death is not the end.' He uttered breathlessly to himself.

"Look! More lights," Cotyr shouted.

"They're blue," Elsar added, "and green."

"They..." Alfron spoke up, "they're just hanging."

And then nothing.

The lights disappeared. Sedron and the hunting group were soon reminded how dark Cheam became in the middle of the flatlands. No campfires, no sun, no falling stars, almost no light at all.

Suddenly, a cloud of ice and snow exploded in the distance. A mist rose from the land and dominated their view of the hills. The situation had new meaning. Something, whatever it was, had hit the flatlands.

The cloud continued to puff outwards and finally washed over the weary travellers. Sedron pulled his cloak in tighter when the wind blew. His wolf barked in the air. Something was threatening it. What did it sense?

A further row of stars descended. As it did a further cloud of snow blew across the land. These gods fell and then stopped. Their lights had not extinguished, yet they no longer fell. A gust of wind brushed along the flatlands, the miasma of ice and snow cleared if only for a moment. Clarity was offered for a moment. All the lights had come to a rest.

The new constellations slept with cosy silence upon the powdered snow. Red, blue, and green; the fallen stars did not twinkle. What were they? Sedron asked himself. No tale or legend spoke of sleeping gods who came to lie in silence.

"The fury of Karthuz rages before us, he protects his kin who wish to sleep," Alfron shouted to be hard upon the wind. Respite from the weather of Cheam had been only fleeting. "Behold Kathuz and his offspring."

"Aye, behold Karthuz," Cotyr added.

Sedron kept quiet. He offered no conclusion for he could not understand how the others knew this was Karthuz. They had to be gods, but why not Armenuz or Galon? Why Karthuz? It did not matter for now the men were at ease. Bad weather was forgotten, the gods have arrived. Will they listen to our prayers, provide us with food, and reveal their godly serenity to us? What fortune it would be for Sedon, son of Ilkand, the village chief, to bring gods back to the village. With such power would come great wealth. Our rivals will despair.

Sedron lead them forward; they would venture forth and meet their makers.

"What sort of creatures are they? Sedron asked. He lead the team ever closer. The silence was long broken. The gods did not sleep silently but emitted a deeply resonant hum. The creatures, gods if they were, looked strange. What should a supreme being look like? Not like this. These were not gods. Surely not.

Confidence dwindled, even in Alfron who was the first declare the lights as gods. It was Karthuz he said, he insisted. No fewer than ten creatures now stood as straight-legged silhouettes against the mountains. The jaws of the unexpected beasts fell upon the snow to reveal an eerie glow from inside their throats. As the team closed in Sedron could see that the creatures had large box-like bodies that were stuck atop four stiff legs. Were these the horses of the gods? Fashioned with lanterns that burn so bright that all can see them from far across the heavens.

Strange animals they must be if their natural resting position is to stand up straight with mouth ajar. Sedron soon noticed differences among them, some were slightly taller and longer, while others were fatter with shorter legs. Each of them were easily as tall as the village church, if not taller.

"Karthuz!" Alfron shouted.

"Quiet, you idiot," Sedron yanked on his brother's cloak. How did these foul beasts fall like stars? As the group drew nearer Sedron stepped more quietly. The creatures' skin shimmered like polished metal: clean and smooth yet unyielding. The wind did not ruffle any hair or feathers.

"Look at their eyes," Cotyr said. He stood just behind Sedron and pointed to the nearest of the fallen stars. "Why do they only have one eye? It shines so brightly... like a star, yet it is long and thin."

They edged closer still. The resonant hum of the beasts had quietened. The coloured lanterns on the legs of the beasts dimmed while the lights from the jaws grew brighter. A gasp of air escaped and perspective changed forever. Familiar shapes emerged from the mouths of the animals thought to be gods.

Bipeds.

The realisation struck Sedron that these creatures were not gods but enemies. A pulsing of blue light flashed near the ships; a thunderous blue flame roared past the hunting party with a howl like none had heard before. They had been spotted. Another flash and then a lagging roar of flame ripped past their heads once more.

"We need to get out of here," Sedron bellowed.

Alfron made no sign of protest, even he had accepted the inevitable. These creatures were not gods. Their silhouettes made them look like men, albeit these were men who had travelled in the belly of a metallic beast. These were men who had appeared to fall like stars from the heavens.

Another roar of flame. Sedron threw himself to the floor and narrowly avoided being hit. He looked up and saw Cotyr standing with on one leg, the other had disappeared. Cotyr mouthed a silent pain then collapsed to the snow. Before Sedon got as far as Cotyr another burst of fire struck Alfron and took him directly to the heavens. He was gone.

Sedron looked to the deceased's sons, his nephews, they had dropped to the floor and huddled together. He saw a fear in their eyes, one which mirrored his own. His brother was gone but there was no for time tears.

Cotyr wasn't fit to make it back to the village. They knew the rules. With Alfron gone then only three of the hunting party would return. In all of the commotion Sedron had lost sight of Elsar; who knew where he was? They called out for him but heard no reply.

With the party in shambles and the threat of a superior foe not far behind them Sedron wondered if it was even possible to return home. What then? This enemy would not stop. Death would come for them sooner rather than later. Sedron would lead them to his family and they would die alongside him.

"We must make it back to the village, we must warn the others and hope they can flee to safety," Fomel shouted to Sedron.

"We'll be leading the enemy to our homes." Sedron replied.

"They will find our homes whether we lead them there or die tonight."

"Aye! That be true."

The three of them spread out and ran as fast as they could across the snowy terrain back to the village. The wolves had survived, they had kept low when the shots were fired, and emerged from hiding when Sedron and his nephews decided to run home. They had to get home and tell the others. It wasn't safe; they had to escape, but where? Anywhere, but here.
Story Three – The Pirate Queen

Zsilana awoke with the taste of blood on her lips and a pounding headache. She felt around to see if her clothes were still intact. 'I wasn't raped, at least,' she concluded in silence while surveying the cubic room in which she lay. Only a single door and no window.

"How's the cell?" At first she thought she dreamt the voice but there was a shimmer of light and shadow through the gap in the door.

"Go die in a hole scumbag."

"That's no way to get released." said a muffled masculine voice with no obvious accent. Moments passed where nothing was said. "That ship you knocked off, bet you think that was funny." The voice did not echo once but vanished into silence. "You won't be laughing if you knew who I was. You better wipe that smile off your face, that was my ship you tried to knock off."

"Yeah... that's nice."

"Don't expect me to take this lightly."

"Sure buddy, I jack ships like that all the time. Now throw me the key and I'll be on my way."

"Oh, but you haven't jacked my ships before... and that's why you were lucky, until now."

"Sounds like you were the lucky one."

"When captains lose ships, they lose reputation. When I lose ships I lose billions of credits. I have zero tolerance for piracy, and zero tolerance for scum like you."

"What's a few billion gallons of Jumu cola between friends?"

"Funny. I've seen your work before, I know fellow business owners that have been damaged by your exploits. Those vac-missile drones rip holes in the side of the hulls and if the ships aren't destroyed then they are forced to limp home with an injured crew. The size of the holes are larger than this security cabin. Do you think about the crews when you perform your heinous acts?"

"Casualties are part of the job. Flying through space is a dangerous way to live. If it isn't an asteroid that gets you then it's the damn pirates." Zsilana laughed.

"Do you know who you stole from?" he barked, "do you know who I am?"

"Everyone, anyone. I do my research, I know what's on each vessel before I take it but I'm not so picky; Jumu Cola today, Azorn Minerals yesterday and who knows what tomorrow brings?"

"Both companies have legal rights to safe passage in Terosan space, as documented in the Kyopix agreement." His monotonous voice was beginning to irritate Zsilana. Where was he from anyway? "Safe and unhindered passage, I should add."

"We're not in Terosan space, and since when did Kyopix care so much about their workers? I've met hundreds of former Kyopix workers in Indie sectors before." Zsilana replied.

"The ships are owned by Kyopix. They are my ships. I don't like it when people damage my vessels. The cola is less of a concern but I do own 30% of the company's stock." That had to be the smuggest voice in the whole galaxy, perhaps he wasn't always so monotonous.

"So I can keep 70% of it and you can let me out?"

"Zsilana..." the wall began to vibrate accompanied by an awful whirring sound. A viewport appeared on the blank wall that gave Zsilana a view of the space outside. "Take a look outside. I'm not playing games." An explosion roared in front of her. An intense shock of shrapnel bounced against the hull of the security cabin.

"Am I supposed to be impressed by the bright lights?"

"That was one of your ships, CAL 34. Designation, light freighter, if I'm not mistaken."

"And my crew?"

"They're safe. I'm not a murderer but you need to learn your lesson."

"I have more ships, one isn't a big loss," Zsilana said.

"Is it not? I don't enjoy losing a ship and I would gauge that you don't either. You hide your feelings well. Keep watching." Another explosion occurred outside.

"I don't think that's legal, not this close to the station."

"Legal? Don't make me laugh my pretty. You know nothing of legal."

"So why are you talking to me if I am to be punished?"

"It amuses me to see you in there. I've heard much about you, Zsilana, but never had the good fortune to meet you, and now favourable circumstances have presented you here with little effort from myself. It was like I just had to think it and you put yourself in front me. Just when I need you. Perhaps it is serendipity?"

"You? Need me?"

"I have a proposition... one that will let you out here, without punishment... but I'll be taking back the Jumu cola. All of it."

"What will I have to do?"

"What you normally do: steal. There is something that I would like to have. Something that Kyopix feels it could benefit from but it isn't something that we can acquire so easily ourselves. You see, Terosan recently purchased an intergalactic propulsion system. Not star to star, but galaxy to galaxy. Can you imagine the wealth we could reap with such a device? Why fight over congested starlanes and limited resources when you could jump to a whole other galaxy with a whole load of other resources. We'd be rich beyond belief."

"Isn't the Kyopix Consortium already rich beyond belief? Don't answer that. I know the answer already. I have to say I'm curious, I didn't know such technology existed... or could exist. How exactly did Terosan 'purchase' this device?"

"Ah, with great cost I assume... from the Hayf Imperium. Unfortunately, Terosan has no intention of sharing this technological wonder... and, well, we want it..." She had a feeling he was smirking but the next thing he was going to say was inevitable. "And you will get it for us."

"Hayf? As in the Hayf Imperium?" She expelled her breath in disbelief, "Nah, now you are just making fun of me. I don't believe it. Not for a second. First, it was an intergalactic drive, then you make it worse by suggesting the Hayf traded it to Terosan. Perhaps you want me to walk over space there, naked, and simply pick it up with my bare hands? Well, of course I'll knock their door first. I best be polite about it, right?"

"Hayf, as in the Hayf Imperium. Yes, the same people. We were astonished by it too but that's what our intel tells us and we know the intel is reliable. I can show you the archive of our doc-streams. Terosan did an impressive job of keeping this one quiet, very quiet. We only learnt about the deal after the delivery was concluded... and I can't think of a single other times that's happened... at least not for a long time. What terms Hayf accepted are unknown, but we both know technology like that can't be cheap. Such a device would lead to untold fortunes and power. I assume that you want to be there along for the ride, don't you?"

"Why me?" Zsilana asked.

"Are you not the best person for the job?" Zsilana smirked at this coy reply, but kept her lips sealed. She waited; baiting him to say more. He muttered, "are you looking for me to give you some praise little girl?" He laughed.

"Nah..." She paused, "I'm not interested, I'd rather just pay a fine and get out," Zsilana replied.

"I can hold you there indefinitely. We're not in Terosan space as you so rightly pointed out; we're in wild space, the independent paradise for criminals. Who will come to ensure that you have your rights? Money talks and I've bought everyone. You're in here and you're staying in here... unless I decide to change my mind."

He had a point, "let's say I do this... how exactly do I get around the Terosan fleet?"

"Come." The voice beckoned. The cell door slid open. "Just steal the device and bring it back to me. Simple."

Zsilana stood up and strolled out of the door. She exited into the inspection room and saw her would-be employer flanked by two armed guards. A man of similar height and a face of smoothed out wrinkles. An impossible monochrome block of slick backed hair sat atop his head.

"Their defenses will be down, we've got that covered. All you have to do is get inside and take it."

She had only meant to glance into his eyes but fixed upon him for a moment too long, "men definitely get better with age." She whistled then stepped close to smell his odour. If he's that way inclined his eyes would follow the cleavage. Zsilana hoped to turn his excitement into favour. Manipulation was always the key to getting ahead. He looked. His eyes dipped. She smiled. The Kyopix boss reached out a hand towards her breasts and grabbed at the ID tags that hung around her neck.

"Fake tags." He pulled the tags free and slipped out the hidden datachip. "Hidden credit chip. Counterfeit too? This is too cliched. I have to laugh."

Zsilana snatched at the credit chip. She leaned closer to peck a kiss upon his lips. "No touching. Touching is extra. I'll get the device but you'll need to replace those two ships you just destroyed." Zsilana smirked.

"You'll get them."

"You set the location and time, and I'll create the extraction plan. This should be a routine operation, although it is one with considerable risk. The device stays with me until payment is settled. If you fail to pay then I destroy the device," Zsilana said.

"It won't come to that. Payment will be generous, I can assure you. A hundred thousand credits per head should cover it."

"That won't even cover the damage they'll do to my ships. Five hundred!"

"I'll advance you two hundred and that ought to see your ships ready for action. The final repair costs will be covered when you return. Plus an additional hundred per head on delivery."

"I want two hundred before I agree to this. Send me the details and I'll review them. Right now, I need to get back to my ship. The crew will be missing me." She blew a kiss and walked out of the inspection room.

Kyopix released control of Zsilana's fleet and returned her crew. Her return to the ship was short lived, a quick reconciliation with the crew before coming back to the station. They allowed her lead ship to wait at one of the company's own airlocks – a premium spot near the market deck.

The walk from ship to market was less than two minutes. Zsilana's heart beated quicker when the airlock opened on to the main thoroughfare of the market deck. She beamed with excitement. This was a small perk but definitely a worthy sweetener. Her usual docking section was several floors away and required a series of lifts that ensured double-backing on yourself just to get to market. It sounded like madness to anyone that hadn't visited before, but the station wasn't designed and built as a single entity – it had grown organically, module by module.

Luryae grinned, she held her captain's hand as they walked into the market. The open air structure showcased a hive of merchant coves intermingled with bars and portable stalls. This module of the station was a half-sphere several stories in height; all the coves appeared to be dug into the exterior frame and faced inwardly looking at each other across the open plaza.

Ups and acrosses – walkways joined one level to another – a web of traffic enhancers. Walk on the left, stand or loiter on the right. Never block a walkway. Alcohol must only be consumed in the designated areas. All chemical inhalers must be smokeless (unless inside privileged premises). Walk, don't run. Talk, don't shout. Mobile communicators must be no more powerful than a hundred squats.

For all that the station was free from Terosan Zsilana felt it ironic that the station had so many rules. She remembered her first visit here with her parents. Evacuees, dirty, smelly, poor, impolite and homeless but that made them cleaner than half the spacejunkers that called Ardent Light their home. Zsilana fondly remembered the creaky welds that joined two mismatched and decaying ship hulls at their seams. Nothing ever fitted right, nothing was painted or sealed either. If mice lived in space they could race from top to bottom in a day.

Those days were an appendage to the modern station. Ardent Light had evolved a long way from its chaotic patchwork beginning. The Kyopix Consortium had done much to modernize the station in an effort to commercialize it, boost local trade, and then extract as much profit from it as possible. They can't claim to have put the station on the galactic charts but they definitely made it the most popular independent destination bar none. The station had ballooned in population and size since Kyopix bought it. Zsilana reluctantly admitted to herself that it was probably for the best. Tripped out spacejunkers threatening families with extortion wasn't the best upbringing for a child, and that was something that Zsilana longed to forget.

Ardent Light was so large that smaller stations orbited it. These new stations catered for specialist needs: refueling, repairs, storage and any needs of the space traveller. The main station had become premium real estate, her mother had predicted. She told Zsilana to watch how big cities can grow by being popular. It was a natural law of the universe as far as her mother was concerned.

If the smaller stations around The Light weren't impressive enough then any first timer would be amazed by the fleets of ships that floated just out of touching distance. The fleets, like the stations, conducted trade and exchanged services with one another. The Light was almost superfluous because it was dwarfed in size compared to the far spread fleets of ships, yet it was the focal point that held everything together. Kyopix reminded everyone that it was the locus of independent commerce.

"So when will you tell me about this job we got? Is it safe? It sounds too good to be true. Think about it. We all got strung up and now we're out because the guy doesn't want to press charges. There is something you're not telling me," Luryae probed.

"Kee, my darling, you gotta trust me on this one. There's a lot of risk but we can pull it off... I just can't talk about it in the open."

After a quick stroll across the market plaza Zsilana lead them into a shadowy corridor thatshe guessed would lead to further airlocks. In a nearby alcove hid a bank of vending machines.

"Freebie?" Zsilana smirked and inserted her fake credit chip into a machine.

"Gimme a Jumu," Luryae laughed. "Did you give it all back?"

"The Jumu shipment? He took it while we were incarcerated but we'll make more on this job than we would have made selling cola."

"So, about this job... what is it?"

"We have been asked to steal something... something big. Kyopix only released us without charges since I agreed to the job. They have agreed to pay us well for the delivery of a certain item."

"You said it will be risky, how risky? This item has to be important to simply let us go. It can't be something so easy to get or they would have bought it already. Kyopix are a powerful player in the galaxy, why would they want our help?"

"It's a high level job and this will secure our reputation as a powerful player in the galaxy. We can do it. We can steal anything, isn't that what we always tell ourselves? No job too big and leave no path unwalked. That's why they asked us: we can steal anything but Kyopix can't. They can't risk their reputation but you're right it is something they can't buy, so they want to steal it. That's where we come in."

Luryae grumbled, she didn't like the risky jobs. She'd agree to go but her expression always betrayed her feelings. "The last high level job we tried almost got us killed. Can you promise me that won't happen?"

"This job is risky and I can't promise we won't die. If things go awry we can run. We've done that all our lives. We'll make it out. Trust me on this one, the stakes are worth it. When we're done you can visit Vinri, as you always wanted."

"I'm thinking... that I don't have a choice, you're going and I can't let you down. I don't like the smell of this, we should be rotting in a jail cell, and we would be if it wasn't for our mysterious benefactor. One who works for Kyopix? So who is our employer exactly?"

"Oh... only the CEO of Kyopix. The guy at the top of the food chain."

"The one and only?" Luryae asked, she hid her surprise.

"Yep. Him. Did I mention I'm meeting him tonight for dinner?" Zsilana smiled.

"Is he cute? Will you-"

"Is that your first concern? Yes, we might 'you know' do that 'thing' but I'll be coming back baby Kee."

"How old is he anyway?"

"Could be 60, he doesn't hide his age and I know he is older than my dad. But less talk on that, you need to push the crew into prep mode. We shouldn't linger too long. Too many prying eyes and we have a reputation for trouble."

"You don't say," Luryae shot a look of incredulity, she smiled, "I had three blasters pointed at my head this morning and that was before security arrived."

"Hey, they broke three of my ribs before even asking my name. That's just rude."

"Broke three ribs? You don't even look hurt."

"Ok, slight exaggeration. They kicked me while I was on the floor. It felt like I had my ribs broken, who's counting?"

"Well you just did..." Luryae laughed. "And yes, our reputation is not that of law abiding citizens of the galaxy but I fear we are messing with people and powers beyond our control. What is it we are stealing for them?"

"I can't say, not yet... the bottom line is that we will be infiltrating Terosan, but don't worry about it. We'll have the support we need. Look, I need to go, I wish I could tell you more but it isn't that easy. Chin up and get our crew in order." Zsilana placed her hand on Luryae's cheek. "We can back out if it goes wrong. Come, let's have another box of Jumu." Zsilana smiled and finally Luryae smiled back.

"Hey!" A voice shouted behind them, "you can't do that."

"Do what?" Zsilana turned around to confront the stranger. A young male approached the two of them. Zsilana sighed. Cute but a poor opening gambit.

"I just saw you steal two boxes of cola." The voice was wavering. Zsilana noted the lack of confidence.

"Relax, you didn't see anything," She replied.

"My father will have your head for this, he owns that company."

"Your father? And who is he to be so great?" Zsilana said.

"My father is Vohosecy Gihriwu, Chief Executive of the Kyopix Consortium."

"Hmmm, never heard of him," Zsilana said flatly. Luryae barely repressed her laughter, she choked then let out a light cough that was clearly a laugh.

"You better give them back. Right now." The petulant voice was gnawing at Zsilana's patience, she straightened her back and noticed the young male's eyes drop to watch her chest raise. The tightly fitting dress was the hook. He was right where she wanted him.

"Tell you what... I'll pay for them." Zsilana pulled out a real credit chip and placed it into his hand. She grabbed his wrist and then placed a kiss upon his lips. He stood still in frozen silence.

"D-D-Do you have dinner plans?" the young man smiled, visibly nervous.

"I do... but I'll make you a better offer." She winked. "Come to my ship and we can have supper. Luryae can sort dinner for you if you promise to wait for me when I get back."

Luryae grabbed him by the shoulders and lead him back to Zsilana's ship. Her grip was far stronger than his. Had he even tried to resist? Zsilana smirked.

"Dinner has to be cancelled."

"Hmmm?" Zsilana tried to hide her disappointment. She was barely inside his luxurious apartment which sat atop the pinnacle of Ardent Light. Expensive looking art adorned every wall. The decorations were otherwise plain and minimalist but gave an air of solid craftsmanship. Zsilana half expected to see his portrait on one of the walls but couldn't see it. Above the bed hung an abstract piece that she wasn't able to decipher: it was a chaotic mess of colours that might have well have been a computer file dump and then framed. Her eyes wandered the room to the extent that her mind drifted from why she was here.

"My sixth wife called to say that she has to visit her company's operations on the station... or so she says but I accidentally left my diary out. Ergo, that's how she tracked me down. Best if you left, this could get messy. She likes shouting, if nothing else," he said.

"Can't be that bad can it? Let's have a drink? Just one." Zsilana smiled.

"I can't." He tried to resist the temptation. Zsilana had turned her back and walked to the whisky decanter. She sniffed the aroma then poured two drinks. She looked deep into his eyes and walked over with both glasses half-full. Zsilana smiled then stumbled with a well practised fake trip. The whisky glass slipped from her hands and covered Vohosecy's shirt.

"Oh! I'm very sorry." Zsilana produced a napkin from thin air and started to dab at the wet patch, "let me help you."

Vohosecy muttered something that sounded like a curse, he pushed Zsilana's hand back then unbuttoned his shirt. "This will need to go in the washing chute." He pointed to a hatch on the wall.

Zsilana stared at his lightly defined abs. Not bad shape for his age. "Do we have time?"

"Time? Time for what?"

Zsilana, "Y'know... before your wife comes."

"No. We don't have time for that." He stared at her, it genuinely looked like anger but she didn't care. Another barrier to overcome and she liked a challenge, despite how short lived this one would be. Then, again, there was another waiting for her back on the ship. This could be the plot for maintaining control: neither knows about the other. Bargaining chips were always needed when business went sour.

Zsilana stepped forward to take his shirt, she stepped too close and pressed her lips against his. Gently sliding her tongue into his mouth she grabbed for his belt as he feigned resistance. He pushed her back then undid the belt himself, he grabbed her by the waist and pulled her closer.

"Clothes. Off. Now!" Was all he managed to say.

"Captain." Luryae stumbled to her feet and saluted Zsilana as she entered the bridge. Zsilana had caught Luryae with her feet upon the captain's computer panel.

"Luryae!" Zsilana snapped but then relaxed with a smile, "no feet on my computer. Ready the ships for departure."

"Things didn't go well?" Luryae Kee asked.

"I need to go shower," Zsilana beamed.

"Oh! I see," Luryae smirked, "well then Captain. It seems I better make this ship ready."

"We need to leave sharp. A transmission just came in as I was leaving. Our target ship is heading into the sector so we'll have less time to prepare than usual but let's make every second count."

"Yes, Captain," Luryae replied to Zsilana, "You hear her." She shouted to the rest of the crew on the bridge, "release the docking clamps and take us out from station. Let the other ships know our route."

Zsilana leaned close to Luryae, "where's the young one?"

"In your quarters."

"Good. I hope he has been treated well." Luryae nodded in response.

"Captain?" Luryae asked.

"Yes?"

"May we speak... in private?" Zsilana pointed to the forward lounge.

The pair stepped inside and sat opposite each other at the oblong conference table. Luryae spoke, "Captain, what are we doing here? The crew is spooked, they-"

"They can't know just yet."

"But-"

"Just tell them it's a routine extraction."

"And the truth of it?" Luryae pressed for answers.

"The Terosan government has purchased a powerful piece of equipment from the Hayf Imperium. The system is being tested nearby and this is our best chance to take it. Kyopix have people on the inside that will deactivate the shields upon our arrival. We will extract the device along with the Kyopix engineers. They will have everything prepped for us. We just need to show up and do our part. It's a routine extraction."

"But, won't it—"

"It's a routine extraction," Zsilana repeated more forcefully.

"Hayf? That doesn't sound routine to me. I have a bad feeling about this, we've never been near Hayf space before and with good reason. The stories never end in a pleasant way."

"But they are just stories. Have you ever met anyone that has survived? Besides we won't be in Hayf space, far from it."

"No one survives that's why we haven't met anyone," Luryae complained.

"And if no one survives then how do the stories get out?"

"Well... you know what I mean. They don't deal with any other species in the galaxy except to destroy them. No one has ever seen them and no one will go near them. That's good enough for me to know this is crazy. What's a bucket of bolts like this ship going to do against their destroyers?"

"Look, the risks are high but we'll make it through. Tell the crew to prepare for extraction and then stay focussed. We'll make it, believe me on this one. We've got some of the best engineers out there to help us make this go smoothly. Let's talk more later, I really need to shower."

"Yes, captain."

The ship was loaded and ready to leave Ardent Light. Zsilana slouched in her chair, she watched on the viewscreens as her crew went about their tasks. Silently she beamed with pride, being Captain had its merits. You picked the destiny.

She leant over with one hand casually stretched out towards the assistant's chair. Zsilana lunged then clasped Feyu's hand. The displays of affection were too casual, Luryae had said. It was simple jealousy. This wasn't a military ship, and discipline had never been a problem anyway.

"After this job we'll visit the pleasure domes of Kriin," Zsilana smiled, she kissed Feyu's hand. He writhed uncomfortably, Feyu didn't seem to enjoy the attention. The two chairs sat on a raised podium above the rest of the bridge crew. "Soon it will be time for you to see what makes us successful."

"Closing in on the position, captain," Lieutenant Byrol shouted.

"Shield up, weapons ready," Ensign Teran added.

"There aren't many ships where half the of officers are female," Zsilana spoke softly so only Feyu could hear. His eyes were scanning the room, he was watching, anticipating, judging. He must be trying to figure out how much danger we are entering into.

"In 3... 2... 1... we're there." Byrol announced.

"Visual," Zsilana demanded, "I want their status."

"Their shields are up and are maneuvering into a defensive pattern."

"Ensign Sarsen, punch in code 359 then transmit on band M."

"Yes, Captain," Sarsen acknowledged.

"Captain, their engines are out," Byrol shouted, "they just turned off for no reason."

"Personal transmission for the captain on band M," Sarsen announced and punched in the commands to relay the message to Zsilana's datapad.

"Sarsen, patch a copy to Luryae."

"Teran, what's their shield and weapon status?"

"Completely nullified. At least for now, Captain, but I can't say how long they will be down for, might be days but could be minutes. I can't tell. Their systems are more complex than I'm used to. Yet somehow their defences came down without any effort. Do we have someone helping us on the inside?" Teran said.

"Another incoming message Captain," Sarsen said, "patching..."

"Bring us about and review the on-screen annotations – we'll spearhead the fleet by going here." Zsilana proded her datapad. The oval viewscreen at the front bridge shone with pulsing lights where the captain outlined her strategy. "Supporting ships will skirt the edges; here, here and along here." She scribbled more lines with her finger. "Teran, inform the boarding party that it's time to dock, they need to be ready."

"Yes, captain."

"There are engineers to extract. Tell the boarding party that they will be at these coordinates: patching them now. Make sure they read my instructions fully for extracting the device, I've been given clear orders to safely remove the device without even a scratch."

Hush fell upon the bridge while the crew members carried out their tasks. Zsilana noted that Feyu's eyes followed her every movement; whether she sat back or on the edge of her seat, his eyes followed. He didn't speak and bore no expression.

"...and docking in 3... 2... 1... engaged," Teran's voice broke the silence.

"Get the boarding party on screen, let's see their helmet feeds," Zsilana said.

"Doors opening. Feeds on," Sarsen announced.

"Boarding team, follow the engineers to the extraction point. Crew member 7 direct engineer Rayot to board our ship, he has a copy of the blueprints for the device."

"All going smoothly so far." Feyu's voice was crisp yet quiet.

"So far, but we can't become complacent." Luryae stood behind Zsilana.

The boarding team had passed through the ship undetected. The internal sensors were still down although it was anyone's guess when they would be functioning again. Fortunately, the Kyopix spies already on board the ship had helped to disable door locking mechanisms where needed. It also helped that all the other doors were locked shut and allowed the boarding party to progress unhindered.

"They're by the device, see cams 3 through 6," Sarsen announced.

Zsilana edged forward on her seat "Team, make sure device is unhinged for removal. I'm counting on the engineers here, you guys told me you knew how to get this device out. Now prove it."

"Yes Captain, device is almost unhinged" came the reply, "but how do we get it out? This thing is huge. There ain't no way this small team is carrying that thing out on our shoulders. No ma'am."

"Don't worry about that crewman, you're doing exactly what I asked, just make sure it is completely unhinged from the supports and ready to pop out when I say," Zsilana replied. She turned and spoke into her ship's intercom, she had another team to work from this ship, "Are the torches ready?"

"Cutting torches ready, Captain."

"Start etching the hull, we'll blow it through from this side," Zsilana instructed then turned back to the open comm-channel to the other crew members, "Boarding team, stand back. This hull's coming loose."

"Yes, Captain," a crew member replied.

"Any further resistance?" Zsilana asked.

"The Terosan crew are readying a combat team to take back the engineering section. So far they've had no luck but we better get moving."

"What's the ETA?" Zsilana looked towards Ensign Teran.

"Only a few minutes," Teran said.

The hardest part about being captain was the limited feedback you experienced while stuck in the Captain's chair. You had to hope that everyone was doing their job to the best of their ability. It wasn't always obvious to tell that when all you can see if a small section of flooring or wall from a crewmembers viewscreen. The device was unhinged from the supports, so the reports had said but it wasn't obvious from the viewscreen feeds. It should however have at least a few more pieces that attached it to the rest of the rest, Zsilana guessed, it had to be tied to the ships engine's somehow. That's how it propelled, surely. The overview she read from the Kyopix spies made it sound simple, yet neither she nor them were engineers.

"Make sure the device is ready to pop. We need to move fast," Zsilana barked to the away team. "Torches, report in, how is the etching?"

"The etching process is almost done captain, but the hull was thicker than expected. We managed to use the pneumatic thumpers to punch through the inner hull, should be easy to lift the skin from this one captain."

Zsilana looked to Teran, "EM-shields and weapons still down?"

"Still down," Ensign Teran replied.

Almost there. This is going to work, it's actually going to work. Zsilana steadied herself in the chair, but excitement was building, her stomach churned, her legs stiffened and her brow became moist from perspiration. It was hard to watch. So close now. There's a lot of credits waiting for us when we get back. A private yacht would be in order – something to cruise around in without the crew, a little something packed full of luxuries.

"Cam 4, I need a visual to your left. Possible breach in adjoining corridor," Sarsen interrupted.

"Looking. Nothing," came the reply, "I'll scout the area and report back."

"Captain," Teran shouted, "the engineers reported that the hull is ready to be pushed through. Suction team has secured the perimeter and are ready for the extraction."

"Then let's make the lift," Zsilana said, "engineers, move back from the extraction point. Crewman 2, lead them back to the ship."

Across an open com channel the entire bridge heard the dirty sound of a discharging bolt rifle. An archaic projectile weapon that made the bloodiest mess. Another shot thundered, it filled the bridge with electronic feedback and reverb. Cam 5 lay smashed and bloodied; dirt, blood smeared the partially working visual feed.

"Breach! We need back up in engineering. Now!" Member 2 shouted across their com.

"Member 5 is down," Sarsen announced.

"Hold tight, I'm on my way," Luryae called out. Zsilana stood up. That was nothing she could say but watch and let Kee exit the bridge. She gulped a loud intake of air that made the bridge crew momentarily turn to watch her. For that moment when the air was held it seemed like hours. When the out-breath came the bridge crew returned to work. She couldn't stop Luryae going, personal feelings only served to make the decision cloudy. The away team needed more leadership. It was the natural choice. 'Be safe', her words came out as a whisper.

Further shots reverberated over the bridge's com system.

"Back up needed. I repeat, back up needed," Crew member 3 pleaded.

"It's coming. Sit tight!" Zsilana shouted. "Has the lifting started? I wanted that device out of there. Now!"

"The hull is breached and but the engineers can't strap harnesses to the device until the fighting has stopped."

"Captain, we have incoming," Sarsen said.

"Well? Send more troops then."

"No, not in there. Out here. Two frigate sized ships appeared from nowhere. Visual in 3. Scanners show they are on top of the our fleet."

"Send out periphery ships. Fleet lead has to stick tight to target vessel." Zsilana.

"Ships dispatched." Teran said.

"Visual on," Sarsen said, "those... they aren't Terosan Captain. That's Hayf frigates, it has to be."

"They're only frigates," Zsilana said.

"Hayf frigates, Captain," Sarsen said.

"Look, just make sure those Hayf whatevers don't get close to our position."

"Captain, this is suicide. We won't survive Hayf frigrates. We should abort," Sarsen said.

"Never. No device, no payment," Zsilanan retaliated, "We need to crush those vessels. How hard can it be?"

"One of our ships is already damaged; retreating. A second ship now disabled. Captain, this is getting out of hand fast. We need a full reteat."

"Not yet, we're too close," Zsilana said.

"Another ship disabled. And another. Our fleet is going down, Captain," Sarsen said.

"Terosan is immobilized, we can hold out long enough." Teran added support to the Captain.

"Focus!" Zsilana shouted, "Hayf must have a weakness, there must be a way."

"Luryae is now on board, patching her through" Sarsen announced.

"It's a stalemate down here, Captain." Luryae said.

"Figure it out and be quick, we have company out here. Hayf frigates" Zsilana replied.

"Hayf? Captain-" Luryae spoke up but was cut short.

"Do your job Luryae, let me worry about the Hayf."

"Another ship gone," Sarsen said, "frigates closing in to our position."

"Bring ships to cover," Zsilana said.

"Our boarding team has been repelled," Teran said.

"Can we still get the device?" Zsilana's voice quivered.

"Soon," Teran replied.

"Captain, bad news," Sarsen said, "a Hayf cruiser just appeared. No warning and no visual yet."

"Luryae? Get out. They've brought the heavies." Zsilana called out over the com.

Sarsen read out further casualties, "Another ship gone, they're taking us down too fast, but the frigates have been deflected from our position. This is our gap to leave. That cru-"

"Forget the device, let's go. Now! Lieutenant Byrol, ready the engines."

A low rumbling engulfed the ship's hull, the floor vibrated which caused the screens to flicker in and out of life.

"Pull us free, we need to leave," Zsilana shouted.

"We need time to release the clamps and close the airlocks." Taren replied.

"We don't have time."

"Cruiser circling to our position," Sarsen warned.

"Go! Go! Go!" Zsilana paced back and forth in front of Feyu, she cracked her knuckles and slapped the sweat from her brow.

"Luryae? Are you on board? Respond, please," Teran spoke over the com.

A dim sound came back on the com chanel, "here, lieutenant."

Zsilana's lead ship pulled free from the Terosan vessel, as it undocked the boarding jetty sliced a gash along the hull. Shrapnel and dirt fanned out from the Terosani hull. Bodies, tools burst, pipes all came free into the darkness of space.

A narrow escape from death itself, this was a story all too familiar for Zsilana. Somehow this was different. She'd never come face to face with any Hayf ship. There was never any need to venture near their territory, and this time was no different. How did they get here so quickly? They're Hayf her conscience told her. They can do anything.

She had stared down the barrel of a gun more times than she could count. Sometimes she held the trigger, other times she was on the floor with the barrel in her mouth. Yet none of those times ever lead to death. Zsilana still lived despite the dangers of her style. She was afraid when death knocked, she never learnt to overcome the fear but perhaps that's what kept her alive. Fear can be suppressed but never killed.

Despite all of that, all the past experiences, this time felt different. Her fleet had never been so methodically disabled or destroyed by anyone. Not the Terosan, not Kyopix, not her rivals, and the petty kings of factions faceless and unknown that inhabited the non-Terosani freeworlds. Zsilana had tried to explain this to Vohosecy, but he didn't seem to care. He seemed heartless.

"I have the plans." Zsilana smiled, she played coyly with her hair.

"The device? You don't have it? I can't pay you without it, I asked for the device," Vohosecy replied in a cool tone.

Zsilana looked at him sternly, "you didn't say there would be any Hayf presence there."

"I couldn't know."

"You should have, you knew there was a fair chance I'd be slaughtered which is why you gave me this mission. You knew the capabilities of the Hayf ships but needed someone else to test that theory."

"No device, no payment."

"Your intelligence agents should have known, you sent us out there to be killed."

"I want the device, not your head. Why would I let you go? You could have ran and never come back, I took that risk and I still need the device."

"The plans will be sufficient, if you don't buy them then someone else will. I'll find a market for them somewhere."

"You'll get a tenth of what they're worth."

"I thought you only wanted the device."

"I want the device, yes. Besides, there is no way to prove that you haven't already copied and sold the plans."

"Well, that's a chance you'll just have to take. I'm right here, right now. Convenient point of sale my friend." Zsilana smiled.

"A known thief with plans of a secret device, sounds like like grounds for making you an outlaw, and all outlaws have bounties on their head. Will you be accepted both dead or alive? We may have to see, and perhaps I should claim the reward myself." Vohosecy smiled and eyed Zsilana, but she didn't flinch at the threat. "Guards!" Vohosecy called out, he rubbed his hands together, "give me the datachip."

"I have it," Zsilana flashed the chip, "but you don't think I came without some assurance? Do you know where your son, Feyu, is?"

"He was dealing with some local corporations, I left him to deal with them," Vohosecy paused, "but, now that you say... have you... I see, you've met my son, haven't you? What did you do with him?"

"Nothing yet, he's a sweet boy. Kind hearted, warm."

"He let himself get captured? He means nothing to me."

"I didn't say I captured him, I just asked if you knew where he was. Feyu is safe, along with the plans for the device. This datachip on the other hand contains nothing useful, it is simply a recording of Feyu asleep on my ship." Zsilana smiled then threw the chip on to his desk, "If you harm me then you won't find either the plans or your son."

"What makes you think you can get out of here alive?" He baited.

"If you are thinking of forcing me to go against my will then be assured that I have people on the station waiting for me. If I die they will know and my ship will leave with the plans and your son aboard. I don't want to die but I think you'd rather have your son back, or you want the plans at the very least." Zsilana held her head high.

Vohosecy said nothing. He stared out a viewport into space, he reclined with a glass of whisky.

"If you won't buy then I shall be leaving," Zsilana spoke clearly.

"Go!" Vohosecy shouted.

Zsilana straightened her tunic then turned to leave the room. She grabbed for the panel by the door. A low toned whoosh noise preceded the opening of the apartment door. She left.

"Ok, I yield. I yield. Come back," Vohosecy called after her.

Zsilana stood in the doorway. She was silent but smiled.

"Give me the plans, and my son, and you can have a third of your payment."

"Half," Zsilana complained.

"You've copied the plans already. I can tell. You're not stupid, so don't treat me as an idiot either. Your losses are your losses, and you can no longer guarantee exclusivity of the plans," Vohosecy said.

Zsilana nodded but hid her smile. A third would be more than enough to replace what she had lost. The Hayf had only disabled the ships, not destroyed them. The Terosan military had boarded and captured the crew but they ought to still be alive. There was hope.

Story Four – Gnir's Raid

"What are you doing?" Qevon sat reclined in his computer chair, he watched Cerrun work with a las-torch.

"Frying my bio-chip," Cerrun replied. Qev stared back, mouth agape.

Cerrun smiled back at him, "what?"

"You removed your bio-chip?"

"Yep."

"How?"

"Just took it out," Cerrun laughed.

"You know what I mean," Qev wrinkled his brow, he was surprised that a Terosan police team hadn't descended from the roof top and broken in through the window, "how did you remove it without setting off the alarm?"

Cerrun smirked, "y'know, the usual way."

"You remember the story about what happened to me as a kid?" Qev said.

"Yep, I didn't just pop it out. You need to plan in advance for this sort of thing."

Qev slinked uneasily in his seat, he tried to get a better view of what Cerrun was doing. Did he actually have another chip in his arm, or what was he doing? "Well, y'know," Qev emphasised the last work mockingly, "this is my place and I don't plan to get arrested today."

"I have another chip hooked up the datapad in my jacket, I planned ahead." A smoldering smell reached Qev's nostrils, he squirmed in fear of Cerrun's madness. "The pad does the business and the chip believes it, everyone's happy."

"I'm not," Qevon said, "you're not the first to try this, and there's good reason that more people don't."

"The first attempts at chip faking was before the TGN was even set up. The first to do it was younger than we are now, although it was simpler then. No profile faking or chip cloning, just straight forward rewiring."

"Profile spoofing has never worked though, they always get caught," Qevon warned.

"The good ones don't get caught and that's why we never hear about them."

"And what about that guy recently who changed his appearance on the TGN?"

"He didn't do it right."

"Clearly," Qev snorted.

"I saw his code, a fair attempt but too simple. He copied a gaming profile and tried to run that on the TGN with his normal biochip. A spoofed profile but the hardware was the same. The authorities are wise to that. Running faster than a shuttle through some of the busiest streets didn't help either."

"We'll see how well you fail then," Qev patted Cerrun on the back and then left to grab a couple of beers. He returned with two opened synthglass bottles. "Here," he commanded Cerrun to take a beer who was still fidling with a lastorch and the biochip.

"This'll work, just wait and see."

"... and if it doesn't at least they'll trace it to my place?"

"Fingers crossed," Cerrun laughed.

"What shall I open? Pre-load the room or you want to test it in a game?"

"Load the room but connect to TGN, I just want to check a few parameters before going out. No point doing all this messing around just to play games, even on the net games they don't check biochips as strictly as they could. No point," Cerrun said, his point made sense. Qev felt he had to agree with the sentiment but was cautious about loading up the TGN from his home connection.

"Computer has loaded the room, you'll need to reach over behind you and grab my spare visor, or did you bring one?" Qev said.

"I brought one, thanks," Cerrun replied, he swigged a gulp of beer and placed the visor over his head.

"Loading in," Qev said.

"You boys better behave in there," Sellicia shouted through from the other room.

The room was empty. The walls a shade of white against the usual grey floor. The light hatch was closed and a single incandescent bulb beamed from the ceiling.

"Watch this," Cerrun jumped, and then again.

"I'm watching you jump?" Qev replied.

"Higher than normal, I've boosted my jumping while inside the TGN."

"So you can jump over a building then?"

"That would draw unwanted attention... like the shuttle running guy did."

"So what's the point then?" Qev prodded.

"To test, refine, and improve our functionality. It is self-empowering."

"Sure..." Qevon wasn't wholly interested, "let's fly, I said to Melec and Krognar I'd meet them this afternoon."

"Ha, Melec. I wonder why we bother."

"You know why, he isn't so bad. He's followed us into the thick of it many times, and you know as well as I that he can code with the best," Qevon said.

"Just pass me the coordinates," Cerrun commanded.

Qev physically passed a datachip into Cerrun's palm before swigging his beer. Just as he wiped his lips Cerrun's pixelated self had vanished. Qev's eyes moved to the location button on his HUD, his fingers tapped on the nearby console and soon his profile slipped into the datastream and sped across the TGN to the target destination.

"How'd you do that?" Qev asked in amazement.

"What?"

"There's two of you,"

Cerrun looked over his shoulder and saw a copy of himself doing the same. Qev was surprised by Cerrun's reaction, neither were expecting it.

"Also, how did you get here so quickly?" Qev asked.

"Tricks of the trade," Cerrun smirked, "I already had a half-search on the location before you handed me the datachip. The coordinates merely removed the other possibilities."

"How did you figure out how to do that? You've far too much spare time." Qev replied, he turned to survey the local area. The two of them stood just out of the awning of a large tower, this neighbourhood was one of the quieter areas in the sector and was often a favourite hangout. Wherever they went staying low key was the plan. Their location jump had taken them to a narrow passageway that connected two towers. Cerrun's two-body accident had remained unseen.

The underbelly of the forest of towers was somewhere that Qevon had avoided since the accident he had as a child. His father's words still rang in his ears.

A message beeped on Qevon's HUD 'almost there', it was Melec. Qev looked around to tell Cerrun but he had disappeared, Qev wrinkled his brow. He moved to the end of the passageway and looked around. The streets buzzed with a light patter of traffic but Cerrun was gone.

"Your problem is simple, you're not in charge and you never will be," Melec appeared, his voice always preceded him.

"Nah, I'll handle it. She'll come to see what she's missing." Krognar looked deep in conversation with Melec.

"It doesn't work like that, your problem is that you're stuck in a dream. You fantasize about what you want to happen. You believe it but it will never be real. Never."

Krognar looked towards the ground, his shoulders drooped with inconsolable acceptance, "but... surely-"

"No. Never. Women want to be ignored. They may not understand it but it is instinctive, thousands of years of evolution takes precedence over reason and rationality. It was true before we discovered electricity and it's true now," Melec's lecture stung Krognar's confidence.

"I see I've missed a fascinating conversation," Qevon felt like yawning but let his words show his apathy.

"Melec doesn't get it, he doesn't know the situation like I do," Krognar defended himself.

"He has no chance."

"Hang in there, it might work out," Qev said.

"It won't," Melec rebuked.

"It might work this time, Melec. He just needs to stay positive."

"Nope, I've known too many women. The rules of the game are the rules of the game. Just take out a hundred and go to the titty bar. Drop a thousand and you might go home lucky," Melec put an arm round Krognar's shoulder.

"It doesn't need to be like that, don't make it sound so depressing," Qev said.

"You wouldn't know man, you had it easy... I don't mean to say you haven't had things tough too, but when it comes to this, y'know?" Krognar looked at Qevon with a look of fear.

"Infatuation is what they call that young man," the group turned their heads to see an old man addressing them. The three friends stood in a moment of silence.

"Old man, it's none of your business," Krognar said, "beat it."

"Listen to your elders, you've got a dose of dreamer's reality. It's fun, I can tell you young un but it's only fun for a time. It's a dangerous affliction to be stuck with."

"Listen old man, I told you to beat it. This has nothing to do with you," Krognar was becoming increasingly defensive, Qev feared that he might hit the old man.

"When you chase someone but they don't know it's infatuation, but if they reciprocate then we call it love. Two sides of the same coin. Best just to put that coin away and follow your friend's advice... as dumb as he might look."

"Cerrun!" Melec shouted.

"What?" Qev said.

"Who?" Krognar asked.

The old man transformed before them. Cerrun laughed.

"Meet our friend Cerrun," Qev said, he could see the funny side of it.

"How the..." Krog stood amazed.

"He's full of tricks. Handle with care," Melec added.

"So what are you doing hanging out with this loser?" Cerrun nodded towards Melec.

"I want to be part of the group, Melec said he'd introduce me to his crew. Y'know he said he'd bring me to meet you guys, he saw me jacking a magtrain and said I should come join," Krog said.

"Mag jacking is a kids' trick. Amusing but simple."

"Yeah man, I respect your skills. You gotta show me how you did that old man trick. I wish I could take my face off and put on a new one, that'd be a cool trick, y'know?"

"That's a lot of custom coding, and custom hardware. Not something you can learn in a day." Cerrun advised, his tone was flat. "You see this?"

"Yeah... it's a credit chip," Krognar answered.

"Look again," Cerrun twitched his fingers and produced two more credit chips.

"Whoa... that was slick."

"That wasn't a coding trick either, I didn't alter anything," Cerrun said. He flicked his wrists and smoothly hid all three coins, "sometimes you don't need to do anything difficult to achieve the best results. Practise will get you where you need to be."

"I will learn that trick, just give me time," Krog said.

"He's smart, he'll do it," Qev said, "we should let him raid with us."

"Melec said I could come," Krog added, "he said we'd probably do something cool, like break into government computers and steal secret information."

"Melec poses a security risk with that tongue of his. You'd best not repeat everything he says. Our next mission will be a search, just like your previous missions," Cerrun said in his usual flat tone, Qevon couldn't determine if he was joking. Melec was remarkably quiet throughout the exchange. Qevon's eyes wandered, he had no desire to listen or interrupt. His eyes drew upon electronic graffiti upon the tower wall, his HUD zoomed into the location. Enlarge. Decrypt. Nothing, yet. Enlarge again, focus, reduce noise. Qevon was caught up adjusting the settings of his HUD's visor that his attention dropped from the conversation.

"A search? But anyone can do a search, how is that a mission? It is a basic function on TGN," Krog protested.

"Everyone can search but not everyone does. Experts are still able to find something that others cannot, despite everyone looking at the same... wall." Cerrun's words snapped Qevon's consciousness back into the conversation. Qev smiled as if though nothing was amiss.

"What will we search for?" Krog asked.

Qevon broke the flow of discussion, "sorry, what are we talking about? I was distracted by the graffiti. Gang tagged but can't clean up the image well enough to read."

"We will search for meaning," Cerrun said looking at Qevon.

"More words games from Cerrun. Always hiding his meaning in semantics," Melec said.

"I don't have meaning, which is why I'm searching for it. Perhaps you can trade some?"

"What if there's none?" Krog asked.

"What if there's none? Exactly," Cerrun smiled, "you were right Qev, smart kid. He has understood something that many have missed. Everyone can search but not everyone does."

"Not everyone needs to," Melec said, "Look this is getting old fast, let's go do something or I'm splitting."

"If we cannot find meaning, then I ask, are we able to find something semantically similar?"

"Semantically similar?" Melec snorted, "what does that even mean?"

"Exactly," Krog said

"Exactly," Cerrun agreed, "Krog is learning fast."

Qevon's HUD flashed with a new inbox alert.

"Let's go hunt for meaning, I'll get my gun," Melec had turned his attention to watching the magtrain rumble along the elevated track. Silence fell upon the four, the noise drowned out all discussion.

"Just got a message from Rik-" Qev broke off, he waited for all attention to return from the passing train. A few people passed closer that Qev wanted, he kept his voice low then said "from Gnir."

Cerrun's attention was piqued.

"Who's that?" Krognar asked

"Another friend," Qev said.

"Another trouble maker," Cerrun said.

"He's one of Cerrun's long time buddies, but trouble for sure," Melec said.

"He's down by 23-18," Qevon said, he was still looking at the message discerning meaning from Gnir's convoluted speech, "he won't give anything more specific, no plans, nothing." Qevon typed into the comp-pad at the end of his real fingertips. He grabbed a stale bowl of nachos and washed them down with his beer. The seat always gave him a sore when he sat in one position for too long, the reclining computer chairs were comfy but the blood wasn't flowing as it normally would. Qev felt that sitting down so much would be the death of him.

"That's all he said?" Melec asked.

"He didn't say much, just asked us to come to 23-18. I pinged back a message asking for his locale but he hasn't replied.

"And he won't, you're bleeding heat," Cerrun added, he sat adjacent to Qev in the reclining chair while his TGN profile stood in opposition. His beer had warmed from sitting too close to the computer. He removed his visor and whacked Qev on the arm, 'you think Sel will fetch us another beer?'

"What?" Qevon announced to the party.

"What what?" Melec said.

"Nothing, Cerrun just removed his visor, he wants another beer. Hold on." Qev said then removed his own visor, 'I'll sort it. Gonna take a bathroom break.'

"Ditto" Cerrun added.

The pair of them returned refreshed, Qev placed two opened beers into the chairs' cup holders. 'I spoofed the pad's reg in the TGN,' he said to Cerrun.

"That's not enough, Gnir will backtrace your pad and he'll see that the reg is spoofed, but it won't match your profile. He knows that will throw up tracebot alerts. At least, it will as far as he is concerned. If he's playing it that safe then the location he gave isn't real either."

"You women took long enough," Melec complained once he saw Qev's profile move again.

"We're trying to figure out Gnir's location, he sent another message asking us to come quick," Qev said.

"23-18?" Melec said then before Cerrun could berate him he added "but that's a spoofed address."

"Spoofed address? What is this guy up to?" Krog asked.

"Too much, that's the problem. He could be doing anything now." Melec said.

"Gnir got Melec arrested the last time they met," Cerrun added.

"Spent 48 hours explaining to the cops why they had the wrong guy. Gnir's an idiot if he thinks he can lift government files with a kids percolator," Melec said.

"A kid's what?" Krognar asked.

"A type of file catcher," Qevon said, "sorta."

"Just steam him some fog and find out where he is," Melec said.

"You really want to know?" Qevon asked, "I thought this would be the last thing you would want to do." Qevon tapped at his comp-pad again, "I'm routing my message in a steam packet."

"I think I know where he is," Cerrun said.

"Where?" Melec asked.

"53 and something, just trying to pin him down. He still appears in the TGN live search, except he's cloned his location and tried to hide where he came from but... well, after a few tricks I've managed to find his location." Cerrun said.

"Ah, I just looked at the search results too. He's running a two-state location mask, that's pretty cool but has to raise suspicion with the autos." Qev added.

"Definitely raises suspicion with the autos," Melec added.

"He could be baiting the government autos," Cerrun said. "23-18 is his beacon that search will take you to by default when you jump."

"So this guy is pretty special? Sounds like he can do alot." Krog said.

"Sure," Melec laughed.

"Ok, he's by 53-06 and... I think 7 too." Qev said.

"Let's go?" Krognar said.

"Wait... Krog, you need a callsign." Melec said, "how about Kid Wonder?" Melec belly-ached at a joke only he understood.

"Kuriosity it is then," Cerrun said then search-jumped into electronic oblivion. He was gone.

Qevon tapped at his comp-pad and entered the queue for his profile to be taken to 53-06. He tapped Cerun's shoulder who had been silent since making the jump, 'have you landed in 53 yet?'

"Yep, I'm having look. Most of the buildings are empty. Nothing obvious, I'll take scout around before you get here."

Qevon's profile landed, he couldn't remember if he had been here before. Night had come to this sector, the darkness was barely marked by the pinpoints of light that dusted the skyline. It was a semi-industrialized area that looked like any other. A factory tower dominated the skyline here, in the near distance were residential towers for the probable workers. Qev figured he might have passed here as a kid whenever his dad carried him around while on duty. The info-plaques listed a few companies designated as small manufacturers and machine servicers. What was Gnir up to?

Melec and Krognar appeared moments after Qev. Cerrun had already wandered off to look for something, he hadn't said what. Qev noted the eerie quietness of the sector. No pedestrians, no trains, no hover cars, no magtrucks. The towers above the 30th buzzed with life yet the base was deadly silent.

"Either of you been here before?" Qevon asked.

"Nope," Krog said.

"There are a lot of places I haven't been to but this place is unusually quiet, even for an industrial centre," Melec said.

Krognar didn't appear focussed, Qev didn't think the youngest member of the group was in touch with the situation. Last time Melec met Gnir he was arrested, Cerrun's words echoed in Qev's head. This time might not be any different. Melec's body had stiffened, the silence didn't feel right for Qevon either.

All the light-hearted humour had to stop, this was no longer a game. Let's not get arrested, Qev said to himself. His heart pounded faster. He had been friends with Gnir for a while but Krog had never met him before. This could be his first taste of trouble and he wasn't even aware of it.

"Where is Cerrun? And how did he get here so quickly? He's around here, somewhere, right?" Krog asked.

"Forget about him, just stay alert," Melec said.

"The silence... what... how... isn't there something wrong here?" Qevon asked. The lightest of breezes spun its way around their feet and across the metallic walkway.

"It's just a pattern null," Krog said.

"What is? The silence?"

"All neighbourhoods have quiet times, especially at night. You can't predict when we people will come or go as schedules change plans go awry. So this means that an area can be busier than expected for a given time of day, or quiet as the case seems to be," Krog said.

"Smart kid," Melec said, although Qev believe it was a mock as he had been the first to observe it earlier. "Is more likely that Gnir had something to do with this."

"Over here," Cerrun's familiar voice was a welcome interruption, he waved them over, "I think he's in this tower. I suggest we try this door."

"Do you know what he's looking for?" Qev asked.

"Not yet, probably government files."

"Must be important to be so secretive," Krog said.

As the team approached the door Krog pointed to a road block sign that prevented traffic from passing close to the tower. Had it been Gnir? Qev looked ahead at the closed door, he wondered if it was locked. Surely Cerrun can figure out how to break it.

As the four of them crept towards the tower they tried to dodge the natural light and cling to the shadows. Finally they reached the wall of the tower, the texture felt as real as it always did, his perspiration was real but he knew this reality was not wholly physical. This felt wrong, they shouldn't be here.

Cerrun played with the door-lock, he worked in silence and kept his hand motions shrouded. Qev couldn't see what he was doing. Devices that kept everyone else out were merely a hindrance for Cerrun. The locking system bleeped and lit up with reds and greens before going silent. Cerrun pushed the door wide open and lead the group inside.

"What is this place?" Krognar asked.

"Some place illegal," Melec said, Qevon hummed his agreeance. The intermitant glow from the lights revealed that they had entered a long hallway of ill-repair.

"Krog, keep close. Anyone you see must be treated as a threat. The government could be sending secbots already, Gnir likely called us in his final moment of need. Don't stray too far, they will trap you if you move alone." Qevon said. Krog merely nodded his reply.

"They'll flood your senses with confusion. the first time is always the worst," Melec laughed as he always did. Qev felt sorry for bringing him along, but it was the only way he'd learn. The kid'll need resolve to make it through, everyone else had been through it.

Once at the other end of the corridor Cerrun worked his tricks with the locked door. As before this one blinked acceptance and opened. They crept forward but Cerrun raised a hand to stop them advancing further. A high pitched whine zipped beyond the door, the distinct sound of a hovering sec-bot. Qev applead to Krog for hush, the younger male was about to ask a question. Once the buzzing noise of the rotors passed into silence Cerrun lead them through the unlocked door into another corridor.

Through a series of doors and tunnels Cerrun lead them onwards and upwards into the belly of the darkened tower. The power had probably been cut, the light was so dim here that Qev suspected everything was running off emergency generators. It could be a sign that Gnir was here afterall.

Cerrun stopped outside at an arbitrarily chosen door, he placed his palm against the wall, "he's here, he's on the other side of this wall."

What's he doing here? Qev asked inwardly, he placed his hand against the wall and felt the warmth of the neighbouring room. The rest of the building was so cold that it felt like a fire was burning beyond the door. Cerrun sliced the lock and nudged the door ajar.

"Gnir?" Cerrun called into the room.

"Copy," came the reply, "I knew you'd come."

"I've got three more with me, two of the usual faces and a new kid."

"All clean?"

"Yep, all good."

"Get in, shut the door," Gnir's voice boomed from the depths of the room.

"What are you doing with that?" Melec asked, "that's a big ass box of transistors."

"It's an old government computer, they seem to have forgotten about it. I found it by accident and... well... I became curious. There's a lot of data here, I'm sure there are some juicy facts they wouldn't want us to know... but, y'know, I can't analyze this alone. That's where you boys come in, you just gotta keep it secret, ok?" Gnir said. Somewhere in there, in the shadows of the room, he is frantically searching through the data. "So what can we do?" Krog asked.

"You gonna keep it secret?" Gnir snapped, "being here is a security risk but I can't do this alone."

"We understand, just chill," Melec barked.

"Cerrun, what do you think of this?" Qev asked.

Cerrun began in a low voice, "definitely government tech, an old design but probably valuable to them. Dunno how he found this but it has him excited and uptight. I think he isn't telling us as much as he knows.

"I can hear you," Gnir called out, "this is big alright, there's enough data to keep us reading for millennia."

"I can see why you'd keep this quiet," Qev said, "generates a lot of heat too, the government sec bots must recognise the power signature too."

"Exactly," Gnir said.

"So what have you found?" Melec said, he wandered around the room looking for Gnir. The room would be large enough for more than a hundred people to dine but most of that space was taken up by the computer.

"Where's Cerrun?" Qev noticed that his friend had slid off into the shadows.

"Cerrun?" Gnir called out, "no messing with the computer now,"

"Can we see what's on here?" Krog asked, "I'm curious to know."

"Best to stand back kid," Melec said.

"Cerrun?" Gnir shouted again, "be careful, I can't risk losing this opportunity."

"Didn't you invite us here to help?" Krog asked.

"I need Cerrun, but I messaged Qev; the two are always together. He ought to be able to help with this."

"What?" Qev said.

"You can stay for the ride, your company is always welcome. I just need him to break something for me. Cerrun? You hear that? I've got a job for you."

"He's probably looking at your problem before you even ask him," Qev said.

"None of the above," Cerrun shouted. Krog laughed and even Melec cracked a smile.

"Gnir, maybe Cerrun won't help you afterall," Krog said.

"This is getting old, fast," Melec interrupted.

"I'm just going to have a look," Krog said, he stepped closer to the computer and looked for an access point.

"Don't touch it, you'll ruin all my hard work," Gnir said, he finally emerged from the shadows. Qev could see the irritation in Gnir's stance, he was on edge. What did he imminently fear?

"But I'm just going to take a look," Krog protested.

Qev decided that it was wise to let Gnir have his way, this was his project and it wasn't a bright idea to let a novice get involved, "Krog, best not to touch."

Melec edged towards the door, "I'm leaving, this is boring."

"You can't! You'll draw too much attention. Just entering this sector you could have already triggered a heuristic anomaly in the sec codes." Gnir said.

"So what's this data then? Why did you invite us and why can't we leave?" Melec shouted and edged closer to Gnir. The two looked directly into each other's eyes but Melec stood a head taller.

Qev watched them stare at each other in silence. The whirring computer sound filled the air. Qev decided to break the silence, "he doesn't know what he has, that's the problem, but-"

"True, yes, that's a small problem, but I have assurances. We can make it work," Gnir said.

"Cerrun?" Qev shouted, "what are you doing?"

"The first thing I do on any job, see who's coming for us. The power this thing draws will raise suspicion with the energy board," Cerrun said, he was standing alone and pointed to the computer. Qev caught a glimpse of his movements, he was tapping into one of the terminals.

"Whatever, I'm leaving," Melec declared.

"Me too!" Krog said, "this is a waste of time."

"Qev?" Melec looked at him.

"I'm in no rush," he lied but he didn't think that he could abandon Gnir at this stage. Trouble didn't have to find Gnir, he was always already there in the thick of it.

"No one leaves until I can salvage as much as I can of the data," Gnir shouted.

A heavy rotor sound filled the airways outside, it sounded like a sec copter. Qev hide his brief moment of panic. There is always a way to escape he told himself, they've been in this situation many times. Qev strolled to the window and peeked out the sec copter, "we need to leave."

"Can't we just disconnect?" Krog asked.

"It isn't as easy as that, we need to run and hide so that they can't trace us." Qev said.

"Cerrun!" Gnir shouted "just take the top 1%, I've marked all the data. Just take what I've marked, it's ordered by importance."

"You folks can figure it out yourselves," Melec left the room and set off down the hallway. The sound of his boots hitting the floor quickly disappeared under the sound of the copter. Krog followed soon after him.

"Cerrun?" Gnir shouted then looked at Qev, "what you feeling?"

"I'm watching crew assemble outside," Qev said flatly.

"Almost done," Cerrun shouted back.

One of the windows cracked from the force of a gas canister being launched into the room. Qev jumped back from the window as the room started to fill with smoke. A light hail of shots cracked the remaining glass.

Cerrun choked, "let's go," he pulled away from the computer and pointed towards the opposite wall. "There's another exit over here."

"But... but... we won't have enough data." Gnir complained.

"It has to be," Cerrun said as he closed the terminal. Gnir was intent to stay. Qev couldn't say anything more, he and Cerrun left by the other door. There was nothing more they could do for Gnir, and no way to persuade him to leave.
