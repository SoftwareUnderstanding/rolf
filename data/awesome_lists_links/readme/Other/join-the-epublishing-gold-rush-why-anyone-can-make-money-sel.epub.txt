MEMO FROM THE AUTHOR

Welcome to a New World

Hi, I'm Pat Mixon and I hope you're excited about this new modern day Gold Rush. Selling ebooks not only can make you a great deal of money but it can also mean an amazing lifestyle change unlike anything you've imagined just a few short years ago.

Not only will you find the world of ebooks to be extremely exciting and fun but you'll also be pleasantly surprised how quickly you're able to learn this new world and begin making real money.

The eBook arena allows you to publish a book, or any other information, for FREE easily and quickly and then sell it to everyone on the planet, on the top eBookstores in the world.

So if you have a book idea, have one written or are a Blogger or an expert on a subject or quite possibly just want to be apart of the leading edge and on the front end of this ePublishing Gold Rush, you can actually start receiving money from your knowledge and getting checks for selling your eBooks. And, I'm talking that can start immediately once your eBook is published.

Some of the people I have helped get on this ePublishing Boom have already made money instantly and watched their eBooks climb the sales charts.

Others making money in this new ePublishing world range from bestselling independent authors making millions to writers selling 100,000 copies of their eBooks and quitting their jobs to part-time people who are supplementing their income from their book sales and improving their lives.

eBooks are an amazing phenomenon, mainly because they allow ANYONE to get in on the action and it solves the biggest problem in business: Finding Customers.

But with Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com and Apple's iBookstore leading the way in this billion dollar industry, these leaders have made the process of finding customers a complete a piece of cake.

This is what the power of eBooks is all about: It takes care of the hardest part of any business for you and makes business very easy!

In my opinion, the growth of ePublishing has not only leveled the playing field but titled it in the favor of independent authors. That's because there are NO BARRIERS to entry. Your book or publication can sit side by side next to the traditional authors on Amazon. And, to the consumer or reader, they don't know the difference.

How Did I Join the Boom?

This book and my other programs & systems came about because after having published five books, including ones under a pen-name, the same question kept getting asked by friends, acquaintances, and even strangers. How did you get your book published on Amazon or Apple's iBookstore?

Believe it or not, is was so much easier than I ever thought or heard. As more people began asking me how do it and do it correctly, I realized this wasn't just good information for my friends. This was something that should be available for everyone.

I want to get something out of the way before we even tip-off. The biggest myth about publishing on Amazon, Barnes or Apple is that it will cost you money or is difficult. Totally the opposite. You can publish an eBook FOR FREE. And, I'll could show you how to have a high quality, printed version of your book for under $10 and never have to buy inventory or get multiple copies made.

But the one thing I didn't want when developing my systems and training was to be like every other basic "how to" book on ePublishing. That's because most of all the other eBook publishing guides have information that isn't really that helpful. Most of it is just a ton of information left for the reader to sort through and figure out.

So, when I found myself telling people how to get published, I found myself providing the EXACT details the way I would like. Step by step. Nothing for you to figure out. That was the key.

One of my mantras is "Results Really Do Matter" and I use this like a compass to make sure I deliver.

In all my ePublishing programs, system and training, what I think separates my work from the rest and has led to its popularity are:

1. **Real Secrets & Tips.** I provide real, step by step, tips and secrets that I used and accomplished, not only the goal of getting your writing published, but done like a Pro. I'm talking quality. And, I give the short-cuts and time cutting methods I used to get published on Amazon for a printed version, Amazon's Kindle e-reader, Barnes & Noble's online store and Apple's iBookstore through iTunes quickly. Most importantly, I'm talking Practical. Real, easy steps to not only publish an eBook but how to write it, format it and get it done.

2. **New Age Media making your book Interactive.** Whether you realize it or not, this is the Gold Rush days for ePublishing. The entire media world is shifting to a new age. And, ePublishing is on the forefront while traditional publishing is going the way of dinosaurs, music, and video stores. So, I can show anyone how to capitalize on all the new ways to make an eBook have all forms of available media. And, most importantly, I'll show the key to make an eBook Interactive and how doing this will set anyone apart, make their work standout. That's because we live in a new age of short attention spans. If you only offer words and long text, you'll lose your reader. But ePublishing allows you not to make this huge mistake. Lastly, I'll talk about the importance of incorporating videos, photos, and website links directly into an eBook.

3. **Real Examples.** In my systems, eCourses, and training, I take people through the exact details of how I published my non-fiction sports book on Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant called _The Kobe Code_. This book happens to be the #1 biography on Kobe Bryant on Amazon and is in the Top 5 of all basketball books sold on Apple's iBookstore/iTunes. I show you how I made it interactive and a bestseller.

So, let's talk about this Boom in ePublishing right now and how you might fit into it.

Are you ready to join this new Gold Rush?

#  The Gold Rush Days of ePublishing

We're all living in exciting times, especially if you are a writer or have a book you'd like to get published. That's because these are the "Gold Rush" days for ePublishing. There was a video in the early 1980's called "Video Killed the Radio Star." Well, the same could be said for traditional books. eBooks killed the Printed Book.

We live in a time now where technology is not only moving at the speed of light but everything we need is on our smartphone, laptop or now tablet. Companies like Amazon and Apple have change the way we read, not just newspapers, but books and magazines. And, it's only the beginning. The iPad and tablet wave has started a revolution. And, eBooks are only going to grow.

Currently, eBooks constitute only 8% of US sales. But this figure will grow rapidly over the next few years. Goldman Sachs recently forecast that sales of eBooks in the U.S. will increase 47 percent each year until 2015, with eBook sales reaching $3.2 billion by 2015.

And, Amazon just announced that they are selling more Kindle eBooks than Printed. For real. That's not a misprint. Wow!

Here's the article:

Amazon Now Selling More Kindle Books Than Print Books

Amazon began selling hardcover and paperback books in July 1995. Twelve years later in November 2007, Amazon introduced the revolutionary Kindle and began selling Kindle books. By July 2010, Kindle book sales had surpassed hardcover book sales, and six months later, Kindle books overtook paperback books to become the most popular format on Amazon.com. Today, less than four years after introducing Kindle books, Amazon.com customers are now purchasing more Kindle books than all print books - hardcover and paperback - combined.

"Customers are now choosing Kindle books more often than print books. We had high hopes that this would happen eventually, but we never imagined it would happen this quickly - we've been selling print books for 15 years and Kindle books for less than four years," said Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO, Amazon.com. Since April 1, for every 100 print books Amazon.com has sold, it has sold 105 Kindle books. This includes sales of hardcover and paperback books by Amazon where there is no Kindle edition. Free Kindle books are excluded and if included would make the number even higher.

I like to use the metaphor of online sales. Back in the late 1990's, when the internet first got really going, when e-commerce really was born, online sales were small compared to brick and mortar, real world retail. But swiftly, in a span of only a few years, online sales catapulted and it seemed everything could be purchased online.

The same wave that occurred with online commerce is happening now with publishing. This is the dawn of what has been called the "New Age of Media" or some even call it "Media 2.0." I'd call it the second generation of the internet or the new Digital Age.

And, leading this charge, on the front of this massive wave, is the way we read or consume our information.

The Kindle, Nook and now the iPad have revolutionized our reading and, most importantly, our viewing experience. We not only can read text but view pictures and now watch videos. We live in an interactive world and it comes to a crux on these new media devices. Even our Smartphones carry the same readers and software that these laptops and tablets possess. And, everything is synced between all of our devices.

My iPhone talks to my laptop which syncs to my iPad. I can read an eBook on my iPhone and then pickup my iPad and keep reading from the same spot. Even my wife and I can share the same books with our Kindle or other reading devices. We now have the ability to have thousands of books on a single device.

Get excited. This is the start of a new age. If you aren't convinced yet, then think of how music changed in the last 10 years. With the release of iTunes and the iPod, Apple re-invented music and changed the game forever. Record stores are dead and CD's are on the endangered species list. That's because the MP3 player revolutionized how we buy, listen and hold our music. All of those physical record libraries, that CD tower, went away when we could hold all of our songs on our iPod. We could buy our music online, it would download immediately to our device, and we could be listening to our musics in minutes.

Well, publishing is now going the same way music did. Borders Bookstores has gone bankrupt and the other leading bookstore, Barnes and Noble, is rapidly trying to re-invent itself as an online retailer. Sounds familiar, huh? Just like what occurred in the music industry.

And now, as in music, you can buy your books online, download them immediately to your reading device (i.e.. Kindle, Nook, iPad, etc.) and you're reading your new book in minutes. And, you can store hundreds, if not thousands, of books on your device or an external harddrirve.

But the real revolution in publishing is what I call _"The Interactive Movement."_

eBooks and ePublishing are enriching our reading experience. We not only can read text but we can pop out to websites via links in the eBooks and we can view pictures, pull up maps or even watch videos that are either embedded directly within the eBook or linked. All of this adds to our enjoyment and enhances not only our reading experience but the author's or writer's ability to tell their story or subject in a more detailed and alive manner. It's all very thrilling.

Lastly, even traditional publishing is nearing extinction. Mainstream publishers such as Random House, Simon & Schuster, Harlequin are all scrambling to jump on the eBook wave. They have or are starting new eBook Imprints, basically divisions solely focused on this eBook revolution.

And, this ePublishing boom has "leveled the playing field" between traditional authors and self-published ones. That's because everything changes online. It all comes down to content, quality and price. Self-published is no longer the red-headed step child.

Fiction writer John Locke, a self-published author, just crossed one million in eBook sales on Amazon. He's like the Jackie Robinson of this new age, having joined the big boys and knocked down all the good old boy barriers that traditional publishing houses used to throw up. They no longer can and are getting beat at this new game.

Here's another super success story.

Content Producers are the New Writers of the 21st Century

So, the traditional Author is dying, on life support and the end is near. Seriously. The writer we all know was so 20th Century. Printed books are going extinct and so are the authors who write them. That's because Prose is No Longer King and text no longer gets it done.

Sure, a great story is still a great story and trumps it all for Fiction. But for non-fiction, it's done, cooked, stick a fork in them. The regular writer or author is headed to the graveyard.

That's because Content Producers are the New Writers of the 21st Century. It's about Interactivity, connecting and capturing your reader. It's now about keeping your reader interested among our shorter and shorter attention spans.

Anyone is an Author now. You don't have to go to school, get some Masters in Writing. Nor do you have to get signed by some New York agent or grab a book deal from a traditional publishing house.

Nope, the Game has Changed. Forever. The Playing Field is no longer level, it's been tilted. And, it's open season right now and top honors are up for the taking.

Did you know that only 7 authors have sold 1 million books on Amazon and 1 of those writers is an independent, self-published author? Yep. And that person is kicking the traditional publisher's ass.

But this is only one Game Changer out of thousands. ePublishing and eBooks are redefining what is writing and what is a book. That's because in this Digital Age, books from traditional authors sit (or come up in searches) side by side with independent authors.

If you create content, you can publish it for FREE and sell it in the same exact places, same sales channels as big corporations. You are the new writers, the new authors. You are the Content Producers.

And, you don't need a degree or some authority telling you that you write well. Readers now decide. Anyone can write a book now and get it published.

It's about having an eBook that is interactive, that Pops, that engages. Period. That is the story.

Now, it no long matters whose (traditional publisher) you are but rather who you are. Social Media can be thanked for that. The playing field is tilted in the grassroots, entrepanurial writer's favor. We play in the same arena as the big boys. We've been invited to the party, so watch out!

We used to not even be allowed at the party, the price too steep. But now the big guys have to come down into the trenches (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and compete right with us. And, it's about connecting as real, authentic people and making real friends. That's the new promotion of this New Media Age.

So, get the headstone ready. The old authors are dead. Now, anyone and I'm talking to you, can have a book sold on Amazon. Maybe you'll be Author #8 to sell a million copies on Amazon. How about it?

Brave Souls & Dying Institutions

The world of ePublishing & eBooks in late 2011 is all about Brave Souls and Dying Institutions. Social Media combined with eBooks has changed everything. And, the playing field has not only been leveled by ePublishing but tilted in favor of the swift, the Twitter savvy, and the Independent author.

This harkens back to another time, when a new medium was just starting up, a new wave beginning to swell. I'm talking about an earlier gold rush, when the brave and daring jumped headfirst into the new waters and swam like crazy. They dreamed of what was coming and embraced new technology.

What is happening today with eBooks, ePublishing and Social Media is a complete Redux of what occurred at the turn of the last Century, when Newspaper and Print were the cutting edge technology of the day and names like William Randolph Hearst, Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein led the charge into those new frontiers.

Now is that same time. Traditional publishing and advertising are dying, or at least on life support, desperately clinging to their old ways, gasping to possibly cross-over to this new era.

But whether they live or die is irrelevant. What matters is the game has changed. Again, forever. Now anyone with a computer is a writer, really a Content Provider. Now everyone with a Twitter or Facebook account is a Brand.

The difference now is that there are no barriers. You can publish an eBook on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple, Google, etc. for FREE. And, you're side by side with traditional authors. And, those big marketing machines must play on the same court was the regular Joe's. They have to connect and gain fans and followers, whether a part-time writer who really is a housewife or some New York Times bestseller A-lister.

Now, you can't buy your way to top anymore. You have to earn it. Write well. Provide compelling content. Engage. Be interactive. Give something that pops.

Then, you have to connect with your target audience, be memorable, standout. But most importantly, you have to be real.

What most people miss about this new Social Media is that it really is old. It is about making real, true and authentic connections. That's like was before the Industrial Age.

Now, we've passed the Information Age and are back in a Social Age. That's why Facebook and Twitter are popular, their true essence is about the human connection. And no big corporation will ever compete as well as normal individuals.

So, if you are brave enough, have something to say, content to provide, a story to tell, you too can jump aboard this new Gold Rush and maybe in another hundred years, they'll be talking about what you did in that Golden Age of Social Media and ePublishing.

Shorter Attention Spans

The final change in our consumption of media is our shorter and shorter attention spans. In this new millennium, we've taken multitasking to new heights. People watch TV and surf the Internet at the same time. They talk to a friend across the dinner table while texting someone else. And, they check their FaceBook postings while watching a YouTube video. Technology is not only moving faster but so are we.

As a result, we want more and more exciting media. That's why the eBook revolution is so exciting. It can deliver on the "Interactive" promise and address people's shorter attention spans.

You can give a reader not just prose and long text but videos and links to keep them interested. Of course, you say, this is important for non-fiction. Well, we're seeing more and more fiction, yes fiction, authors going the Interactive route, with videos, links, etc. There's even a bestselling author whose book was so interactive, after every couple of chapters, you'd pop out to his website and watch a high quality short film with known actors that kept the story going. All of this is to keep the reader's interest high, connected and enhancing their storytelling. You can email me and I'll share this author's name and book. You'll know who he is right away from his success writing and producing on TV.

So, by wanting to get into the ePublishing game, you're on the front end of this growing wave. It all starts now. And, the key is to not only do it right but quickly and for as little or no cost as possible.

I'll show you how to get into this right now.

Text is So Last Century

All this buzz about ePublishing and eBooks misses the most important point: We're on the cusp of ePublishing 2.0. Just having a digital version of a printed book is what I call ePublishing 1.0. It's so the last decade.

That's because prose is still prose and text is still text and who wants to take time to read that?

I sure don't and neither do my readers. The real movement and the next serious wave in writing, publishing, and content providing is what I call "The Interactive Movement."

It's not just about catching someone's eye or getting their attention. And, a good story might hook someone but will it really last, can it sustain someone to read 300 pages?

Man, 300 pages sure sounds like a lot to read. Didn't that stop when I graduated college? Who reads that many pages of text now?

No, ePublishing 2.0 isn't about text or putting fancy fonts into your eBook. And, it's not just about thinking you're creative and cool by adding some timely pictures or even tossing in some slick videos.

They key is about Interactivity and engaging your reader, your audience for the length of what you are offering. You do this by weaving a compelling and engaging digital offering from start to finish.

That's why I say the next generation of eBooks need to be part People Magazine, a dash of YouTube, and a heaping serving of Huffington Post.

Writers no longer need to be Authors. Hell, they don't really need to even write well. They need to convey and communicate. And, this is most effectively done by connecting with your readers.

That's why short bursts of prose or text hold attentions. And, prose must be more casual. Conversational writing is the real conversation. We're bored with fancy writing, authors who talk to us like teachers and act superior.

We want to read in the same manner our friend would talk to us or the guy next to us at the bar. And, we want to stay interested, keep involved.

Epublishing "2.0" authors do this by using all the tools in their arsenal: Video, Pictures, Music, weblinks, etc.

eBooks are really webpages and websites. The better and better the eReaders, the iPads, and the other devices we use to consume our online media become, the more that statement will be true.

So, if you really want to succeed as a writer, blogger or author in this New Age of Media, be more People Magazine than New York Times.

Prose is No Longer King

Do you get it yet? Prose is no longer king.

This doesn't mean readers don't read, but you don't have to do it anymore simply in a "text only" manner. You can add pictures, videos, links and many other eye-catching and interactive tools.

Don't get me wrong. The eBook world still breaks out into genres and you'll definitely need to now which one your writing belongs in. It's just that like everything else, the definition might be shifting.

#  Types of ePublishing

In this emerging digital age, ePublishing mirrors the old print world in what is produced but in so much more in-depth and broad ways. And, while ePublishing still falls into three traditional categories, what could now be called a non-fiction book may be quite different from the one your parents read twenty years ago.

The basic categories break down as follows for Types of ePublishing:

  * Non-fiction

  * Novels

  * Magazines

But like I just mentioned, the fun is less in the category and more in what you do with it. That's because presentation and story-telling have changed. You can now do it in such visually compelling and enticing ways.

#  Why Publish Your Book on Amazon's Kindle?

Amazon struck first in this new digital age, mimicking Apple's success with the iPod and iTunes. If you think along those lines, then you'll understand what Amazon did regarding the eBook world.

Here's a link to the Kindle Store on Amazon:

 http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b/ref=topnav_storetab_kinc?ie=UTF8&node=133141011

They launched a new reading device called the Kindle but also simultaneously brought online the Kindle store. Just like Apple, you could now buy a Kindle and then go to a "one stop shop" place called Amazon's Kindle store. There, you could sample books and then buy. You could also buy nearly as many books as you could possibly read and have them all stored on your one reading device, the Kindle. Just like with the iPod, you'd have your books with you whether you went and whenever you wanted. Amazon even upped the ante by enhancing subsequent editions of the Kindle with 3G and Wi-Fi access so you didn't even need your computer to get more books.

The Kindle changed the game. And now, others have followed and are looking to surpass Amazon. Barnes and Noble launched their version, called The Nook. Apple wasn't far behind with their iPad and iBookstore. All the offerings are similar, providing both the reading device and the online store to buy your eBooks. And, a clear winner hasn't yet emerged and might not.

But as an author, it doesn't matter who wins this e-reading device war, because I'll show you how to publish your eBook on any platform.

For now, however, let's stick with Amazon as they are the leader currently. So, back to the focus of this section.

So, Why Kindle?

  * Leader

  * One stop

  * Easy

  * Free to publish

  * Max exposure

Leader:

As I've mentioned, Kindle and Amazon currently have the market share lead at 70%. That lead has narrowed in the last year and probably will continue to do so, but they are the leader. They are the Kleenex. When you think of eBooks, you still think of Kindle.

While I want you to publish your eBook on all platforms available and be ready for even new ones, I suggest you focus your initial efforts to publish on Amazon. All our work will then translate easily and effortlessly to the other contenders.

One Stop:

Just like Apple did with the iPod and iTunes, Amazon has done with Kindle. It is a one stop shop for e-reading needs. You buy the Kindle or even use the Kindle App for iPhone or Android and then you buy books on the Kindle Store on Amazon.com and you're off and reading. You can even share an account with family or friends, allowing you to only buy the book once and Amazon has even recently added a feature called "lending" which allows you to lend a book to anyone for a designated period of time, just like a real book.

Amazon's thought of everything and you'll be able to take advantage of that because you will publish there.

Easy:

Amazon makes publishing your book very easy. So much so, it consists of really only three parts: A Cover, the Inside of the Book, and all relevant Sales data. You can literally publish your book in less than an hour when you have those three parts ready.

Just keep in mind right now that Amazon stands for Easy. That's all that should matter to you, as the author who wants their book published.

Free To Publish:

That's not some infomercial or tease. That's a fact. To publish your book on Amazon and Kindle is FREE. Yes, completely free. There is NO cost to you to go through the process to publish your eBook with Amazon. And, Amazon has a sister company that can publish the printed version of your book for under $10. That's not a tease either.

Amazon is author friendly. You get to publish your book for free and then you get 70% of all sales. Amazon makes money by your book selling and that's why they take 30%. So, you only pay Amazon when you sell. There's literally no cost to publish your eBook.

That's probably the most attractive and exciting point of the entire ePublishing wave. I can publish my eBook for FREE.

Maximum Exposure:

At this point, Amazon is King of the online book selling world. So, when you publish your book in the Kindle Store there, you have maximum exposure to readers who want your book. And, because it is a searched based world, you are only fingertips away from your reader searching on a topic and finding your book.

I equate publishing on Amazon like real estate. The old adage is location, location, location. Well, in the online book world, no only does Amazon have the best location but it is even growing.

As I mentioned, real world, print booksellers are a dying breed. National bookseller Borders has gone bankrupt and closed stores throughout the US. Barnes and Noble, while avoiding the same fate as Borders, has quickly adapted and thrown their hat into the online, eBook, new digital age of publishing. But their brick and mortar stores are struggling as are all mom and pop bookstores.

So, by publishing on Amazon, you're in the best location on the web for eBooks. I'm talking globally. I have my books sell all over the world and in places such as the UK and Germany in particular.

And, since it is FREE and you're not limited to publishing only on Amazon, why not?

#  Amazon's Rearview Mirror: Other Big Boys are Gaining

So, everything I just told you about Amazon is true. For now. But Amazon's got some serious competition coming up fast in their rearview mirror. Amazon might be first but it might not be the overall winner. The debate is still out if Amazon is the Portugal of this new pioneering age: striking first ( a la Christopher Columbus) but get overtaken by others (a la England and the United States of America.)

My philosophy and the one I want you to adopt is simply this: We don't have to pick a winner. You can publish on all of them. Cover our bases, so to speak.

Here's the other top players:

Barnes and Noble

Barnes and Noble jumped quickly and effectively into the eBook and eReader market with the launch of Nook. And, while the Nook doesn't outsell the Kindle, the reader is well liked. It has a color screen and most of the Kindle's core features. You can read at the beach and the Nook is lightweight.

And, Barnes is making a massive, and I mean massive, push into the eBook sales online. They are rapidly shifting their business model away from being brick and more, store dependent to online.

Lastly, Barnes launched in 2010 their version of Kindle Publishing called PubIt. With PubIt, you can publish your book directly with Barnes and Noble and appear on their online store, right next to eBooks by Random House and all the other big boys. PubIt leveled the playing field. Barnes if far from dead and they will make this transition. Don't count them out.

The missing secret out there is that you can go directly to Barnes and get your eBook published with them. You don't need a middle-man. It's actually very easy.

Apple

Initially, it seemed like Apple and their creative genius CEO Steve Jobs acted like eBooks were amateur hour. Apple seemed reluctant to jump into the fray. Maybe that was posturing while they continued heavy research and development on the iPad. But once the iPad came to market, everything changed.

Apple has changed the landscape of computing once again. For a company who had home runs with the iPod and iPhone, the iPad might just take the cake.

The tablet is a full computer but the real marvel of this device in its stunning visuals. Everything looks better on the iPad, not just websites but books and magazines.

This is why I say Amazon is far from winning this race. Apple is gaining and gaining quickly.

With the launch of iPad, Apple released the iBookstore. Now, the iBookstore is an integrated part of Apple's juggernaut, iTunes. So, you can search, download samples and buy eBooks of any flavor, kind or genre right to your iPhone, iPad or even computer.

So, don't count Apple out on winning this race. They made the blueprint and they look to be following their own plan.

And, anyone can have their eBook published on Apple's iBookstore. You just need to know how and it's very easy.

Google

Google, like Apple, is another dangerous company to Amazon. They play hard and really bring their "A" game. They are now making inroads into the eBook landscape with Google Books.

Google Books is similar to all of the other online bookstores but with Google's search engine prowess and dominance, they can guarantee that their books from their bookstore comes up first on user's searches.

And, Google is challenging Apple within the Smartphone operating system race with the Android. There are going to continue to be more and more tablets, similar to the iPad, sold by other computer makers that will run off of the Android Operating System (OS). This means that Google will remain a big-time player for years to come.

Other Players

There are countless other players rising, falling and birthing every day in the eBook arena. Sites like Smashwords and Lulu give you the ability to publish in multiple formats in a "one stop" concept. These are called "Aggregators." I like these sites but I also like to "Go Direct" to the top players.

That's why I'll show you exact steps to publish on Kindle, Barnes, Apple, etc. even though the Smashwords, Lulus, etc. offer you the ability to use them and get on all of the sites.

And, companies like Sony and Samsung have their own eReaders that might pose threats or even simply buying options to the other devices I've mentioned earlier.

Lastly, there are fantastic online eBookstores such as Diesel Books, Stanza, etc. that readers can buy eBooks from. I simply call these sites "retailers" as they simply sell eBooks. You'll want your books on these sites too and I'll show you later how to do that.

#  How to Succeed

The ePublishing world can be intimidating. But, it is also exciting. This is the front end of it all, the beginning of the wave. That's why I equate it to the Gold Rush.

These are the boom times. But, you must be smart, know what you're doing. When you do, it's magic in a bottle and success pours your way. When you don't, it can lead to frustrations and disappointment.

Here are some of the key components of success with eBooks. It's more a Top 10 list rather than all-inclusive.

Price

Like music on iTunes and in the online digital age, price is important for eBooks and is dependent on the type of eBook and the genre. The prices are all over the place, from $.99 up to $50. But the average eBook sells on Amazon's Kindle Store for $9.99.

I equate an eBook to a printed paperback and even the large publishers like Random House, Simon & Schuster, etc, follow this logic. Comparing Print to eBook, the eBook version will be around $9.99 while the print will be from $14.99 to $29.99.

But the main point here is to do your research on price and realize that like with musics, readers are price sensitive. That's not to say you won't be able to price your book to market or in line with your direct competition, you will and I'll show you how. But, your competition might be selling at $4.99 and you'll want to follow suit if you want maximum success.

Interactive

If I haven't made it clear enough, I'll say it again. This is a new digital age, where media has changed and evolved. The key aspect of the most successful eBooks is that they are INTERACTIVE.

And, why not? The format of the eBook allows for pictures, videos, links, etc., so why wouldn't you have all the tools and features in your eBook? And, it's so easy to do.

Niche

The key way to find success in the eBook arena is to know your niche and exploit it. Sure, if you are writing general fiction and up against John Grisham, your book might not be at the top of the list. But even in these cases, you will get seen. That's because the eBook world is entirely broken down into categories. You'll be able to add keywords to your book as well as multiple categories to define your work. So, you can have a legal thriller and even include John Grisham's name in your key search words. I'll show you how.

And, many successful eBook authors, such as John Locke who I mentioned earlier, have exploited their niches and given the traditional publishers, the big boys, a real run for their money. Those old school publishers are like the Titanic. Big ships but small rudders. Fast moving and adaptable authors like Locke have beaten those big publishers at their own game and climbed the bestseller lists for their niches. These new media authors KNOW their target audience, how to connect to them and also deliver on their content. Their books are as good or even better than the mainstream, known big-time authors. And, many of these eBook authors price their books well below traditionally published authors. Those big dinosaurs can't even compete at those lower prices because they have too many costs.

Who wins? The reader. Great content, from great authors, at great prices.

Niches and target audiences are key buzzwords of this ePublishing Gold Rush. Get to know them well.

Here's some Search Examples for Kobe Bryant and Legal Thrillers:

But the main point I want you to start thinking about is what niche or category is my writing. That will be super helpful as we proceed. And, if you don't know just yet, I'll show you who to start researching where you're eBook might land in.

#1 Way to Succeed:

HAVE A SYSTEM, A ROADMAP, A GAMEPLAN

But the real way to success, the one that shortcuts all others is to have a real Gameplan to bring your eBook and ePublishing dreams into reality.

There are many ways to do this including the old "Do-it Yourself" approach. This involves reading tons of books, doing your own research, and figuring a lot of it out by yourself.

The DIY method also probably guarantees Headaches, Frustration, Mis-steps and a lot of Time wasted.

The other approach is to Hire someone. Get an expert to do the work for you. But this costs and can be very expensive, in the range of $1,000 to $5,000. And, that is just to edit your book, format it, make a cover and publish it. You probably haven't even addressed Marketing or Social Media yet on this path.

The last approach might be the best because it is not only proven but fast and easy. You can follow the Path, the steps laid out before you taken by a successful author who has done it. You can follow their Gameplan, use the Roadmap they used.

This is what I suggest. Follow a System. Find a good one, that is comprehensive, and that others have found real value from. Then, commit yourself and stick with it.

It will save you Time, Work, Money and blaze the path for you to go from having a book idea to making real money from selling eBooks.

No matter which path you choose, I sincerely hope you really do pursue your dreams and get an eBook published.

Then you too can say you've Joined this ePublishing Gold Rush.
