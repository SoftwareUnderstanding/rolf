Revenge

The battle at Landon was fought over

five years prior. The bodies of the fallen

warriors were buried in the graveyard

behind Landon Manor. Two however,

were not buried in hallowed ground.
Prologue

"What holds us back!? I tire of the darkness." "Shut up idiot and keep trying!" "You call me an idiot, have you ever considered that we must be dead!?" "We are not dead! We have somehow been magically entombed!" "Then explain why we have not felt hunger or thirst all this time!" "It has not been that long! Why, it was just yesterday that I ate half a pig, or maybe the day before..." "See! You have no concept of time at all! You do not even remember the battle!" "I may not know where we are, or how we got here, but we are not dead!" "Say what you will, but I think I was..." "Shut up! I think I can see something!" "Yes! I can see it too! It is the sky! Thank God, I can see again!" An ominous voice suddenly filled the air!

"What makes you think God is who you should thank, Robert Timlon!? And did you really believe you were still alive, Richard Timlon!?" The voice cackled. "Who are you!?" Richard shouted into the air. "All in good time! Are you not pleased to finally be free!?" The voice now asked. Robert and Richard looked at each other. Yes, they were finally free, but what was next? Robert could see through his father's body and his worst suspicions were finally confirmed.

"Father, I told you we were dead." Robert said calmly. Richard raised his hand and tried to back hand Robert, but his hand went through his son's face! "Do not call me that!" Richard demanded, realizing for the first time that they were indeed...dead. "Oh I could watch this forever! But enough! I have work for you!" The voice commanded. "Who are you!? Show yourself, I will not talk to air!" Richard shouted. "So you wish to look upon me, so be it!" The voice shouted.

With that, the ground began to rumble and a body floated up from an opening that had suddenly appeared at their feet! A stench filled the air that would make swine retch. Robert, though totally repulsed, could not take his eyes off the figure in front of him. It stood seven feet tall and was black as the darkest night! Its entire body was leathery like a bat. Its face was that of a corpse, with eyes that shown red! Richard, who was not a diplomat in life, was the first to speak.

"Who are you!? And what makes you think that we would do anything for you!?" Richard demanded. "I am Nihilia! And you owe your very existence to me!" Robert turned to run, but could not, his feet seemed to be rooted in the ground! "You will not go anywhere unless I allow it!" Nihilia screeched. "Leave him be you disgusting animal!" Richard shouted. "So, my appearance is not to your liking? Then what about this?" Nihilia asked , then produced a blood-red crystal. Robert and Richard watched as Nihilia's features began to soften. He was changing shape before their eyes! As the transformation finished, Richard fell to his knees and began to weep, "I have never known anyone so cruel." He sobbed. Robert looked at the beautiful woman that Nihilia had changed into, then to his father, "Who is she father?" "It is my Lynda, your mother." Robert had never seen his mother, and, though intrigued, was not impressed, "It seems you wield much power Nihilia, what is it you want of us!?" Nihilia smiled at Robert and again transformed. Robert looked stunned. Richard, who was composing himself, also stared in disbelief.

"Father Devon!? You want a Priest!?" Richard exclaimed. "Yes, I want you to lure him here." Nihilia replied. "We may be dead, but not stupid! I know not what will happen to our souls, but what you ask is...sacrilege! Robert now shouted. "And with your power, why do you not get him yourself?" Richard asked. Nihilia grew tired of the questions and held the red crystal at arms length. Robert and Richard found themselves suddenly engulfed in flames! Both of them writhed and screamed in agony! "As you now see, I am your salvation! There is no heaven for the likes of you! You will do as I say, do you understand!? Nihilia exclaimed. Robert and Richard both nodded in agreement as the flames subsided. Nihilia reverted back to his 'normal' shape and stared at them. Robert found himself afraid to speak, he did not want to incur Nihilia's wrath again. Richard however was angry.

"You want us to get Devon here, fine! Tell us how!" Richard demanded. "Have you not learned your lesson? Would you like to feel more pain? Nihilia asked, calmly. "No, but father has a valid question," Robert offered. Nihilia could now see that he had succeeded. They would be his pawns until the Priest was brought to him.

"Richard, you will go to the manor of Joycen, and create as much havoc as possible. Robert will go to Braxton and do the same. "I do not know of such manors, you talk in riddles Nihilia." Richard replied. "Oh that is right, you have not been privy to the changes of the lay of the land. Joycen Manor was once Landon, Braxton was once Timlon and Chapman, but history does not matter, if I am correct, Joycen and Braxton will seek out help from Cashell." Nihilia said. "But I thought you wanted Devon. How will any of this bring him to you?" Richard asked, looking to Robert for his input. A bond that had not existed in life seemed to be surfacing. "Yes Nihilia, if we go to Gareth, he will surely amass an army and..." Nihilia held up a hand and cut Robert off, "An army is of no use fool! Eventually they will go to Devon. The Priest will investigate and will finally be mine!" Nihilia sneered. Another thought crossed Richard's mind, "But we have no substance. How will we create any commotion at all?" Nihilia looked at Richard with disdain, "You have the brain of a fool! Just as I have allowed you to again walk the earth, I will empower you so that the living will be aware of your presence."

The marriage of a human and a child of nature was rare. A baby, born of such a union, was even rarer. The questions surrounding Loanna and Devon were many. Igus asked Artemus if he would meet with Devon and Loanna, Artemus agreed.

Igus, Arianna and Artemus watched as Jessica, Devon, Loanna and Brittany came into the clearing. Igus was the first to speak.

"Come, my friends, sit, I have made tea and some cakes." "Thank you Igus, and thank you Artemus, I appreciate your taking the time to see us." Loanna said. "I know of your questions, Loanna. But first let me tell you of the normal development of a child of nature." They all sat down and Artemus began.

"Shortly after their birth, the parents give the children to the elders. The elders then teach them of the laws of nature, and the lessons of the crystals. As they learn, they begin to develop into adults, at a rate three times that of a human." Artemus stopped for a moment, to let that sink in, then continued.

"A normal child takes seven years to totally develop. Though taught aspects of the four elements of nature, only one is mastered. Igus for example, as Devon figured out, masters the earth element. Each child is then given a protectorate, an area in which they maintain the balance of nature." He stopped and looked at Jessica, then continued.

"Sometimes, however, a protectorate experiences changes. Then the child must adjust his or her thinking and adapt to those changes. Jessica did an excellent job." Loanna looked at her mother.

"What does he mean, mother?" "Before the initial battle with Corsea, the bog was part of the Echo Forest. After Igus flooded the area, I had much work to do to restore some semblance of sanity." "That would be one way to put it," Artemus added. It was Devon, not Loanna who now seemed antsy.

"With all due respect Artemus, what does it all, mean?" Artemus now sensed Devon's concern for his wife and unborn boy.

"The Children of Nature, though not true immortals, do live a very long time. Loanna, Brittany and the unborn child will all have extended lifetimes." "What do you mean, 'not true immortals'?" Devon asked. "A true immortal, cannot be physically killed. Their wounds heal instantly. The Children of Nature, on the other hand, can suffer mortal wounds." Artemus said, then looked to Loanna sensing her uneasiness.

"Yes Loanna, you will stay virtually the same as you are now. You see, Jessica and Shaun had a choice to make when you were born, they chose to raise you as a human. Though I thought it was a mistake, I could not interfere. That is why it is frowned upon for a child and a human to marry." Artemus replied sadly. Devon went to Loanna and held her.

"What will the people think of an old Priest with a beautiful woman on his arm!?" Devon laughed. The others joined in the laughter, and Igus added, "What indeed!" Artemus held up his hand to quiet them. Although he could appreciate their humor, he had more important matters at hand.

"Loanna, Devon, you two will also have that decision to make. The boy that Loanna carries can be taken to the Isle of the Ages and taught the lessons of nature." Artemus now asserted. Loanna and Devon looked at each other, then to Artemus. Jessica felt their concern and spoke.

"He will know you are his parents." Jessica said, then added, "We all know our parents. They are in our hearts every day. My parents, for example, live in Adroitia." "She is right Loanna, my parents live west of Our Lady's Lake." Igus added.

Devon picked up Brittany and kissed her cheek. He was trying to digest what was being said. The thought of being separated from his children did not seem right. But still, he thought, did he have the right to deny his son this opportunity?

"You have time to make your decision. I know it will not be easy, but whichever decision you make, will be honored." Artemus now said. "I am trying to understand Artemus, but now I have more questions then ever." Loanna said. Arianna who had been quiet, finally spoke.

"Artemus, if I may make a suggestion. Why not use the Crystal of Knowledge to instill the information directly into their minds?" "Yes! Of course Arianna! I should have thought of it before. Loanna, Devon, if you will allow me to do this, all will be clear." Artemus assured. Jessica took Brittany from Devon when he and Loanna agreed. Artemus asked them to close their eyes and sit very still. He then took a pale yellow crystal from a pouch and closed his eyes.

The crystal began to glow ever so slightly. As the light grew in intensity, Devon and Loanna were levitated as a soft yellow glow engulfed them. Artemus was able to hear and answer each of their questions in minutes. As the glow subsided, they slowly floated back to the ground.

It was Brittany who first broke the silence, "Me next, mommy!" She giggled. Loanna went to Jessica and took Brittany in her arms.

"I understand now Artemus." Loanna said sternly. "I too understand. I believe that we have already decided." Devon added. Artemus smiled at them. He had accomplished what he came for and closed his eyes. They all watched as he began to fade, and disappear. Igus and Arianna decided to leave the family to themselves and began to fade and slowly disappeared. Jessica looked around and realized they were alone, she also realized the mistake she had made.

"I am sorry, my daughter, I should have let the elders teach you." She said. "Mother, you have nothing to be sorry about. I may have never met Devon had you done so. We are where we belong." Devon put an arm around each of the women, "Let us go home, it has been a long day."

The celebration had taken place every year since Gareth the First's death. After Gareth's sixteenth birthday, however, it became a celebration of giving. Each guest was asked to bring a gift of food that would be distributed to the less fortunate. Katryn invited all of the usual guests.

At the main table sat Katryn, with Gareth and Melanie on her right. To her left sat Lisa and Michael. Michael, at five years of age, was already inches taller than children of his age. Gareth took great pains to teach his son of humility, he knew of bullies, his son would not become one. When Devon, Loanna, Jessica and Brittany arrived, Michael asked Gareth if he could go play with Brittany. The two children would play and talk for hours. There was a special bond between them that only Igus understood.

"How are you folks this fine day?" Gareth asked, as Brittany and Michael ran to play with the other children, then added, "Please sit with us." "We are doing well, thank you. I see you have collected a grand bounty to give to the poor." Devon said. "Yes, it has helped many people over the years." Loanna noted, then went to sit with Katryn, Melanie and Lisa. Jessica excused herself and went to keep an eye on the children.

"So Devon, have you decided what you will do with the baby?" "Yes Gareth, though it will not be easy, we have decided to let him go to the Isle of the Ages." Gareth could see the sadness in Devon's eyes, "I do not think I could make that same decision my friend. If you need anything, please know that you can come to me." Gareth then saw Christopher walking toward them, and saw that he looked serious. Gareth thought back to their first meeting near the Serenity, at last year's celebration, he also remembered what Katryn had told him.

"Lord Gareth, I am Sir Christopher Stippick of Welshire. I am part of Thomas' entourage. Can we talk?" "Yes, of course." Gareth said, extending his hand. As the men shook hands, Gareth sized Christopher up. He was a few inches shorter than Gareth, but had broad shoulders and a powerful chest. His brown hair, blended into a soft brown, well trimmed beard. He had a kind face with light brown eyes that held...sadness?, Gareth thought. "My Lord, I would ask your permission to call upon the Lady Katryn." Christopher now said.

Gareth found himself taken aback. It had been over nine years since Gareth the First's death. Gareth had never thought of his mother with another man, but knew that she must be lonely at times. As the two men talked, Gareth learned that Christopher was a widower with a twelve-year old son, named Edward. Christopher told Gareth that he was smitten with Katryn the moment he saw her. Gareth smiled at that, his Mother was indeed a very beautiful woman. He found that he liked Christopher and arranged a formal introduction when his mother was alone.

"Mother, I would like you to meet Sir Christopher Stippick." Christopher bowed at the waist and kissed Katryn's extended hand, then said, "My Lady, would you do me the honor of allowing me to call upon you."

It was Katryn who was now taken aback. She looked at Gareth, who was smiling. She had never even entertained the idea of courtship. She looked back to Christopher and found him to be quite attractive and then felt a twinge of guilt. 'How can I betray my husband's memory?', She thought. She now realized that Christopher was still holding her hand, and pulled it back.

"I will think upon it sir." She said, looking at the hand he had just kissed. "That is all I can ask my lady. Thank you Lord Gareth. Good day Lady Katryn." Christopher said, bowing slightly, before turning to leave. Gareth could see Katryn was uncomfortable and was not sure if he had done the right thing.

"Mother, I am sorry if he upset you. If you wish, I will tell him you are not interested." "That, my son, is the problem. I did feel an attraction to him, but I also feel...guilty." Gareth went to her and held her. "Guilty? About what mother? Father loved you very much. Do you not think that he would want you happy?" Katryn looked at Gareth and smiled, "You spend too much time with Devon, but, I am not sure of what to do." "Before you make a decision, talk to Devon, talk to your friends. I believe they will help settle your mind." Gareth assured.

Katryn did talk to Devon and Lisa, as well as Melanie and Loanna. They all agreed that she should seek out happiness, and that Gareth the first, would indeed be happy for her. When Thomas heard of the courtship, he allowed Christopher to become a knight at the Manor of Joycen.

Katryn and Christopher would take many walks along the Serenity. They talked many hours and Katryn found herself being drawn to him. On one of their walks, about six months after they met, Christopher took her in his arms and softly kissed her. She felt herself melting into the moment, a feeling was coming over her that she had not felt in years. Suddenly, panic filled her mind and she began to run back to the manor.

"What is wrong Katryn!?" Christopher shouted, running to catch up with her. "I must be alone, please go home!" She shouted, as he caught up to her. "But Katryn, what have I done!?" "Please, if you care for me, leave me alone!" "But Katryn, I love you! Surely you must know that!" "Please Christopher, go home!" As Christopher watched her run through the manor gates, he felt his heart sinking.

"Oh my love, what am I to do!?" Katryn sobbed, as she kneeled at her husband's grave. "You have been given a great gift Katryn, a soul seldom finds love once in a lifetime, you have found it twice." Katryn was startled, and turned toward the voice.

"Igus! What are you doing here?" "I have a friend who is hurting." He said quietly, as he went to her and held her. "Igus, my heart is torn between Gareth and Christopher." "Gareth is dead, Christopher and you are alive. Every soul put on earth are eventually allowed to enter the gates of paradise. Gareth has walked through those gates and would now want nothing less for you than happiness." "If only I could be sure Igus." "Think back to what Gareth told you as he was dying." Igus said softly. "I cannot remember anything of that day, but the pain." "Then let me help you." Igus said, taking a crystal from his pouch.

A light glow surrounded them and Katryn could now see herself kneeling next to her husband's side. She could hear him talking, asking her to be strong. Then the last thing he said to her..."Do not close your heart my love." Katryn now understood what Igus was saying. She felt a sadness, but knew that it was all right to love again.

"Thank you Igus. You have helped me see though my guilt. Gareth would indeed be happy for me." "I was only too glad to help. Now, I believe a message is in order." Igus said with a smile. "Yes! I will send it first thing in the morning!" Katryn affirmed.

"Lord Gareth, I would have a word with you." Christopher said, jarring Gareth back to the present. "Christopher, how are you? So what is on your mind?" Gareth asked, extending his hand. "I am fine my lord, I would like your permission to ask for Katryn's hand in marriage." Gareth appeared to scowl and then winked at Devon.

"There would be terms...if I say yes, that is." Gareth said coyly. "Terms, my lord?" "Yes, terms. From this moment on, you will address me as Gareth!" He said, slapping Christopher on the back. "Gareth it is, thank you!" "Well, what are you waiting for? Mother sits by herself as we speak." Gareth said, pointing to Katryn.

Gareth and Devon watched as Christopher kneeled down on one knee beside Katryn. They could not hear what was being said, but there was no doubt that the proposal was accepted. Christopher stood and swept Katryn up into his arms and kissed her. Gareth nudged Devon and they walked to the happy couple. Gareth got everyone's attention and raised a glass of wine.

"A proposal has been made and accepted!" He exclaimed, then turned to Christopher and Katryn, "It is with great honor that I announce the engagement of Lady Katryn and Sir Christopher!" As the cheers went up, Lisa, Melanie and Loanna ran up and congratulated Katryn.

Corsea was on the Isle of the Ages for six months before Artemus allowed Igus to visit. The change in Corsea was more than Igus could have hoped for. Corsea went to his brother and embraced him.

"Igus! I am so happy to see you!" "You do not know how long I have waited for this moment." Igus said, holding back his tears. "I am changed Igus. I can only say that I am sorry for the pain I inflicted. When you helped me, I felt a connection, an awakening if you will." "Water under the bridge! No longer will we dwell on the past. How do you feel?" Igus asked, changing the subject. "I cannot explain all the new sensations. I look at everything differently now. Igus, do you know how wonderful periwinkles smell!?" Igus looked at Corsea and laughed, "Yes, my brother, I do!"

They sat and talked for hours. Igus could see that Corsea was truly happy and one with his heart. The change was nothing short of miraculous! Igus then told him of Devon and Loanna's unborn child, "They have already named the child Shaun. They have decided to allow the elders to take the boy and teach him." "When will he arrive, Igus?" "Loanna will have the child in about two weeks. It will be especially hard for Devon." "Yes, humans have a hard time giving up their children. It saddens me that they will feel a loss. When you speak to them, let them know all will be well." Corsea finished.

Jessica, and Arianna stood next to Loanna as the labor began, they then kneeled and closed their eyes. A soft blue light enveloped Loanna. She would have no pain during the delivery. Jessica moved to the foot of the bed knowing that the baby would arrive in a moment. She bent down and held the baby, then gave the baby to Loanna. As the baby cried, Loanna held him and asked for Devon. As Devon entered the room, Jessica put her arms around him.

"He is beautiful!," She exclaimed. Devon had a broad smile on his face, "Yes, he is ! Oh Loanna, he is perfect!" It was then that Artemus entered the room. He could see that all was well with the child and now allowed Devon and Loanna one last chance to change their minds.

"You understand that you will not be able to see him for the first year." He said. Loanna and Devon looked at each other, and nodded their heads, "Yes Artemus, we know it will not be easy, but we believe this best." Devon said. Artemus admired him. Loanna's decision was easier, she was practically a child of nature. Devon however, would not be able to do what all fathers and sons do.

"When you next see Shaun, he will appear as a three-year old. You will then be able to visit him once every three months, but only for four hours. Finally, after he fully develops, you of course, will be able to visit anytime." "Yes Artemus." Devon said, softly. Artemus smiled and added, "He will grow strong and able, Devon. Loanna you must be proud." Loanna smiled weakly, "Yes, I am. And now we must allow Artemus to take him." Jessica released Devon and he went to Loanna's side, "May I hold him before you take him Artemus?" "Of course Devon, but I must take him with me within the hour." Arianna's eyes remained closed, she would now help strengthen Loanna.

Artemus and Jessica left the Parish and walked by the Serenity. "Devon's heart is breaking you know," Jessica said to Artemus. "Yes, but he is strong. A lesser man would not allow this to take place." "Are you talking about Loanna's father Artemus?" "Now, now Jessica. Do not get your ire up. I take as much responsibility for Loanna as anybody. You full well know that I could not interfere." "I am sorry Artemus. Though I am happy for Shaun, I feel especially bad for Devon." "A year from now, he will see his son and know that he has done the right thing. The time grows short, come, I must go." Artemus asserted.

Arianna opened her eyes, and spoke, "How do you feel Loanna?" "Wonderful! Thank you for helping!" Loanna then looked at Devon, "Devon, you can still back down, I would understand." She said, putting her hand up to his cheek. "No my love, we have discussed this many times. If we do not allow this, we would be denying the world a precious gift." "Well said, Devon." Artemus said, as he entered the room, "The time is now, my friends." He finished.

Devon and Loanna kissed Shaun and handed him to Artemus. They watched as Artemus closed his eyes and began to fade with Shaun. In a moment, they were gone. Jessica went to Devon and Loanna who were softly crying, "It will only be a year. The time will fly by." She tried to assure.

The first few days were very hard on Devon. He would go for long walks by himself. Loanna understood and allowed him his solitude. Jessica stayed at the Parish, helping with the cooking and cleaning. She also knew of Devon's need to be alone.

On one of his walks, Devon found himself at the oak tree near Cashell Manor. He had not seen his friend Gareth for weeks, and decided to visit. As he walked through the manor gates, he could see Gareth running across the courtyard.

"Devon! You are just in time! Come see! Melanie has had the baby!" "What is it, a boy or a girl!?" Devon asked, running to catch up to him. "I do not know yet! It just happened!" The two men ran up the main stairs and into Gareth's bedroom. Melanie was propped up with pillows and holding a child. Lisa brushed Melanie's sandy hair. Katryn turned to her son and smiled.

"Calm down Gareth, you do not want to wake your daughter do you?" Katryn said smiling. Gareth hugged his mother and went to Melanie. He kissed her on the forehead then looked at his daughter, "Melanie, she is as beautiful as you." "I do not feel very beautiful." Melanie said weakly. "Congratulations!" Devon said, trying to sound happy. Katryn looked at Devon and realized Loanna must have had her baby. She went to him and held him.

"Congratulations to you also. Are you and Loanna all right?" "Yes, thank you Katryn." Devon said, forcing a smile, then asked, "What are you going to name her, Melanie?" "We have not decided Devon." She said, then looked at Gareth, who winked at her, then back to Devon and added, "We were always thinking of boys names, I am afraid we never considered a name for a girl. Do you have any ideas Devon?" Devon looked at his dear friends and felt a tear come to his eyes. He wished he were home with his wife, so he could comfort her. He now realized that he was being selfish.

"You do me a great honor. When Loanna and I were thinking of names for Brittany, we narrowed it down to two. The other was Rebecca." Lisa, Melanie, Katryn and Gareth looked at the baby. "Perfect!" Melanie said. "Yes, Rebecca, a lovely name for a lovely little girl." Lisa added. "Rebecca it is then." Gareth said, standing to shake Devon's hand. They retired to the study, allowing Melanie to get some much needed rest. As they sat down, Gareth poured Devon some wine.

"So Devon, how are you holding up?" Gareth asked, knowing that Artemus had Shaun at the Isle of the Ages. "I was not doing well at all until I came here. I was being selfish, Gareth." "What do you mean?" "I have been taking long walks, leaving Loanna to her own sadness. Thanks to your kindness, I can see what a fool I have been." "I am glad I could help, but I expect that you would have worked it out on your own, my friend." Gareth said. Devon smiled at his friends. He thanked Gareth, Katryn and Lisa and started back for the Parish. He needed to be with Loanna.

In the following year, Devon, Loanna and Brittany would visit Igus on many occasions. Igus and Arianna had been instructed by Artemus to teach them how to use the crystals, not all, but some. Though they were more than happy to comply, they were confused. Arianna found that she could teach Brittany the easiest and took care of her when Devon and Loanna went off with Igus. Though Devon had been shown how to use the crystals years earlier, he now realized how inadequate his concentration had been.

"Why is it suddenly so important to learn about the crystals?" Loanna asked, remembering the jealousy she felt when Igus tried to teach Devon seven years prior. "If you are willing to learn, I am able to teach. However, I cannot force you to learn." Igus answered. "Ah yes, the ever-present side stepping." Devon now said with a smile. Devon had become much more comfortable with the Children of Nature. He had grown to understand them or, so he thought.

"So Igus, what would you teach us today?" Devon asked, confidently. Igus sensed Devon's smugness and addressed it. "Your mind would be better served in concentration then in condescension." Igus chided. Devon digested Igus' words and was embarrassed. He had not considered himself prideful, nor had he ever considered himself above anyone. "I am woefully sorry. I have chosen my words unwisely." Devon said, hanging his head. "None of us are above reproach my friend, I only tried to point out a short-coming that might prevent us from progressing." Igus allowed.

After Igus' criticism, the lessons did go much better. Though Loanna did not learn as quick as Igus thought she should, Devon began to excel. At first, Igus thought Devon was still trying to show off, but as the year went on, Igus could sense a special talent within Devon.

And the year did indeed go by quickly. Devon, Loanna and Brittany would be allowed four hours to visit Shaun. Artemus came to the Parish and transported them to the Isle of the Ages. They had never seen any place so beautiful. The air was filled with exotic aromas. The colors of the flowers were brighter then any in all of Kingsland. Strange fruits grew on odd trees. Brittany ran toward a being sitting under a tree.

"Igus!" Brittany shouted, as she hugged him. Artemus smiled at the little girl, "That is Corsea, Igus is at the Echo Forest." Devon and Loanna looked at each other and smiled. They could see that he was as content as Igus had told them. As they walked up to him, Devon offered his hand. Corsea stood and shook it. "You are most kind, Devon. Your little girl is beautiful." Corsea said. "She takes after her mother." Devon smiled. "I can see that. How are you Loanna." "I am fine, thank you. Please do not think me unkind, but it has been a year..." Corsea held his hand up, cutting Loanna off. "No more need be said. Shaun is also anxious to see you." He laughed. They said goodbye to Corsea and followed Artemus. He led them to an area called the Garden of Knowledge. A little boy suddenly shouted.

"Mother, Father, Brittany!" Loanna immediately ran to him and picked him up. "Shaun! You've grown so big! Look Devon, he looks just like you!" She exclaimed, hugging Shaun. Devon turned to Artemus, "I thought you said he would appear as three, he looks six!" "Yes, your son is special and is learning at an accelerated rate. Though we do not understand, it is nothing to worry about " Devon went to Loanna and took Shaun from Loanna's hold, and held him. Loanna could see tears welling up in Devon's eyes. Shaun finally broke the moment. "Thank you father. I love you." "And I love you, my son." Loanna then bent down and picked up Brittany, "This is your brother, Shaun." "I know that mommy!" Brittany giggled.

Artemus truly wished that the parents could stay, but that was not an option. The lessons of nature were tedious and needed full attention. He watched for a moment and went to them. "I have set a table with food and drink for you. I will return when it is time to take you back to the Parish." Artemus said, leaving the family to themselves.

They sat and talked of Shaun's lessons. Loanna and Devon were amazed at his maturity. It was almost like talking to a little adult. Brittany was amazed also, but not of her brother.

"This tastes good, what is it mommy?" Loanna looked at it, then at Devon who shrugged. "I do not know honey." "It is a banana mother. Try it!" Shaun said. Loanna tasted the strange looking food and smiled, "This is delicious!" "The world is full of wonderful fruits and vegetables. Here, try this father." Shaun said, handing Devon a papaya. Devon took a bite. "This is wonderful, when do you find time to study with all this delicious food about!?" Devon laughed. The four of them talked and laughed. But the time passed all too quickly and they could see Artemus coming toward them.

"It is time." Artemus said quietly. Devon went to Artemus and shook his hand, "Though it saddens me to leave, I now know we have done the right thing." "Your son has been blessed with wonderful parents. Are you ready?" Artemus asked. "Yes, just give me a moment." Devon then turned and went to his son, who was getting a hug from Brittany.

"I love you Shaun!" Brittany said with a giggle. "I love you too." Shaun said. Loanna then bent down and picked him up, "We will miss you, my son. But it will only be three months." She said, then hugged and kissed him. Devon took him from Loanna, a broad smile on his face. "No tears this time. As your mother has said, we will miss you. I love you son." With that, Devon hugged him. It was then that Shaun whispered in Devon's ear.

"I love you father. Ask no questions, but beware Nihilia." Artemus overheard Shaun but ignored it. There was a fine line between interfering and helping a parent, "Come, I will return you to the Parish."

"What do you think it means, my love?" Loanna asked, tucking Brittany into bed. "I wish I knew. Tomorrow I will go to the forest, perhaps Igus can shed some light on it." Devon said, now taking Loanna into his arms, then added, "I love you!" "And I love you, but what is this all about?" "You gave me the strength to let Shaun go. I have no doubts at all now." He said, softly kissing her.

"So, how was your visit with Shaun?" Igus asked, as Devon came into the clearing. "It was amazing Igus! He is so intelligent!" "Yes he is! Artemus seems to think that he will fully develop early. Come, sit and have some tea." Igus said, floating down from the Great Rock.

"Igus, Have you ever heard of something called, 'Nihilia'?" Devon asked "I have not heard his name in ages!" Igus exclaimed "You look upset Igus, who is he." "He is a changeling who has the power to restore substance, bodies if you will, to lost souls." "How is that possible Igus? The scriptures teach..." Igus held up his hand, "I know of the scriptures Devon, but as you now know, there are many things in nature that the scriptures do not cover." "Yes, of course. Please continue." "When a body is not buried in hallowed ground or if a grave is not blessed, the spirit of the person tries to reconnect to his or her body. Nihilia seeks out these spirits and tries to trick them." "Actually, I have heard a legend concerning that. It is said that if a grave, not in hallowed ground, is left unblessed for six years, then the soul is doomed to roam the earth forever." Devon now said. "Exactly! The soul gives up and that is where Nihilia comes in. He lures them to a ravine, then convinces them that he is the only one who can help. He has been known to scare men to death, then bury them and wait six years." "That sounds monstrous! I have never understood why God allowed such atrocities." Devon exclaimed. "Devon, you must remember that everything is as it should be. There is good and there is evil."

Ian Joycen and Geoffrey Braxton were well rewarded for their service to Cashell and Kingsland. Lord Thomas had given Geoffrey, the manors of Timlon and Chapman, which became Braxton. Katryn and Gareth petitioned Lord Thomas to allow Ian to take possession of Landon, which became Joycen.

Six years after the battle at Landon, strange things began to take place at both manors. The chickens stopped laying eggs. The cows were always agitated and gave no milk. As a matter of fact, all animals at each manor seemed to be in a state of constant agitation. At Joycen however, there was one added problem, a ghostly figure began roaming the halls. The first sighting was two days after the sixth anniversary of the battle of Landon.

Ian's wife, Jean, was having tea on the balcony that overlooked the courtyard. Suddenly she became aware of somebody watching her. Standing in front of the balcony doors was what appeared to be a man who was bleeding from a gapping wound in his chest! Jean screamed, knocking over the chair as she tried to run inside the manor. Ian ran to see what the matter was, but the specter had already disappeared! "Jean, what goes on!?" Ian shouted, sword drawn. "There...there was a man...I swear...oh Ian he was bleeding everywhere!" She exclaimed. Ian held his trembling wife and looked about the balcony. He saw no blood, nothing! "There is nothing here now." He said, stroking her hair. "Oh Ian, it was horrible!" "There is no one here, come, let me pour you some tea." Slowly, she walked back onto the balcony, not letting go of Ian. "I could have sworn..." "Perhaps a trick of the morning sun, see, there is nothing here." She sat down, starting to calm. "I am sorry Ian, I feel so foolish."

It would be only the beginning. As the sightings increased, Ian decided to visit Gareth. He also sent a message to Devon requesting that he meet with them at Cashell. As Ian was preparing to depart he could see Sir Geoffrey riding through Joycen's gates. As Geoffrey dismounted, Ian could see that he was visibly shaken.

"What is wrong Geoffrey? You look terrible." Ian asked. "When I tell you, you will think me a madman!" He exclaimed. "Would it have anything to do with a ghost?" Ian asked slyly. "How do you know!?" "I have the same problem. I am on my way to Cashell, why not join me?" Geoffrey could not help but laugh at Ian's cool demeanor. "Yes, why not?" Geoffrey replied, feigning boredom.

The four men sat in the study at Cashell and Gareth poured wine. "It seems that Joycen and Braxton are haunted." Ian said flatly. "Surely you jest!" Gareth laughed. "I wish I were. Though I have not seen the ghosts, many of our men have, including Jean." "Ghosts? More than one?" Devon asked. "Yes, the one at Braxton has an arrow in his forehead." Geoffrey said. "My ghost appears to be older and has a gapping wound in his chest." Ian stated. Gareth stopped laughing and suddenly looked pensive.

"Does that not sound...familiar, Ian?" Gareth now asked. "Familiar?" "Yes, you saved my life by killing Robert Timlon with an arrow to his forehead!" "Yes that is right!" "And after Melanie was stabbed by Richard, I threw my sword into his chest." Devon, who had not witnessed the battle at Landon, was taken aback.

"In his forehead!?" Devon asked. Ian looked at Devon and put his hand on Devon's arm. "Yes my friend. I could see Gareth would be killed. I only had a second to aim. I was trying to hit Robert's shoulder, but as he lunged at Gareth, his momentum put his head in the path of the arrow." Devon looked at Ian's eyes and could see the remorse. Then a thought crossed his mind.

"Gareth, where were the dead buried?" "All but Richard and Robert are buried in the graveyard at Landon." Gareth replied. "Where are Richard and Robert?" "They were thrown into the Lost Man's Ravine." Devon now realized what was going on. "Dear God Gareth, you know not what you have done!" Devon exclaimed, putting his head in his hands. Ian looked at Gareth, then back to Devon.

"What are you saying Devon? Gareth, as well as the rest of us, did not believe that they deserved to be buried in hallowed ground." "That is the problem, my friends, all dead should be buried in hallowed ground." Devon then told them of Nihilia. Gareth listened intently.

"It is Nihilia, who gives their spirits substance, bodies if you will. He then has a grand time watching the chaos that follows." Devon finished. When Devon mentioned a ravine, a story Gareth had once heard, came back to him. "I never realized." Gareth said sadly, "But you mentioned a ravine, which ravine?" "I do not know, Igus never gives all the details, you know that." Devon smiled. "Oh yes, he can be cryptic. But I remember a story my father told me, I have always thought it fantasy, but now..." Gareth's voice trailed and he looked to Ian, "You know of the legend old friend?" "Yes of course, although the legend originated at Welshire, the actual incident took place west of Joycen." Ian said, then recounted for them what he was told when he was a squire for Sir Wayne. As Ian told the story, Gareth could tell that Devon's mind was churning.

At the tender age of seventeen, Gareth's grandfather, Michael, had already fought in seven major battles, and distinguished himself as a brave warrior. The captain of the guard at Welshire sent him on a reconnaissance mission. With thirty knights and twenty archers, he was to search the land south of Welshire for a rebel strong hold. After traveling a week, they came upon three men, more dead then alive. Michael told his men to dismount and help them.

"Who are you?" Michael asked the one man who seemed most conscious. "I am Paul, thank you for stopping to help." "Well Paul, what happened to you? It looks as though a battle has taken place." "We were taking our crop to Welshire when rebels attacked and stole our goods." Paul replied weakly. "How many of them were there?" Michael now inquired. "Ten, maybe twelve." "Which way did they head afterward?" "East, toward the ravine. Though I do not understand that." Michael raised an eyebrow, "Why do you say that?" "The ravine is said to be home of the devil himself. No sane man would enter that area!"

Michael made sure that the three men were taken care of, then headed east. The trail that the rebels left was easy to follow. After about four miles, they came to a ravine. Michael could see that the rebels had gone into the ravine. He had his men dismount. Evening was falling and he decided to set the guard and make camp. They would wait out the night before exploring any further. As midnight approached, the guards noticed an eerie red glow in the ravine and woke Michael.

"What do you think it is Wayne?" Michael asked his second in command. "It could be a campfire. Do you want me to take a scouting party and find out?" "The bluff behind them leaves no other way out. No, we will wait until daylight. In the mean time, add five men to the guard." Michael asserted. "Yes sir, I understand, I..." Screaming from the ravine stopped Wayne mid-sentence! All of Michael's men sprang to their feet, and grabbed their weapons! The horses became agitated and strained against the ropes that held them!

"What should we do Michael!?" Wayne shouted, as the screaming grew louder. Michael was still trying to figure out if his men were being attacked, or if the men in the ravine were being attacked. The screams seemed to be about two hundred yards away. "Have the knights form a defense line in front of the archers!" Michael commanded.

The men reacted immediately. If it were an attack, the archers would let loose their arrows under the protection of the knight's shields. They could hear horses riding hard toward them and Michael raised his hand to begin the attack, but the horses had no riders! When the last horse galloped past, they all noticed that the screams had begun to fade and finally stopped. Michael waited a half hour then told his men to stand down. He decided they would go in at first light.

The ravine ran about five miles, south to north and about three miles east to west. It had a slow incline that ended about fifty feet below the main road. The entire ravine was wooded and Michael told the men to dismount and lead the horses.

They made their way toward the area where the screams had come from. The men could not find anything. It was as if the rebels had been swallowed up by the earth itself. Michael pressed farther into the ravine until he came to a steep bluff that went a hundred feet, straight up. He then had his men head south. No sign what so ever. No campfire, no tracks, nothing.

"It makes no sense Wayne. There should be something. We know there were at least ten of them!" Michael declared. "Each man lost. There should be at least one or two of them who found their way out," Wayne commented. "Come Wayne, we will return to Welshire and tell of this Lost Man's Ravine."

"That is why Lost Man's Ravine is avoided to this very day." Ian said as he finished the story. "Could that be where Nihilia lures the lost souls?" Gareth asked, reading Devon's mind. Devon looked at his friend and smiled, "Igus has an eerie way of doing that too. Seriously though, it does seems likely." "Who is Igus?" Ian now asked. "That is not important, but I must travel to Welshire, to consult with Father Leonis." Devon said, trying to recover from the slip of his tongue. "That will take weeks Devon! The ghosts are causing all kinds of havoc!" Devon looked to Gareth for help. "Devon, perhaps you might find an answer in the Parish library. In the mean time, we will not tell the women." Gareth now admonished. "Agreed, but I will have to tell Loanna. You know how she is." Devon said with a sly smile. "Yes of course! I do not want her mad at us!" Gareth said, as the four men started laughing.

Devon stopped at the Parish to let Loanna know where he was going. He told her of Robert and Richard, then asked her not to mention them to the others. She understood. Gareth arranged for a coachman to bring Loanna and Brittany to the manor. After they headed to Cashell, Devon walked to the forest. As he came into the clearing, he could see Jessica and Arianna.

"Good morrow ladies! How are you?" "Fine Devon, would you like some tea?" Arianna asked. "Yes, thank you. Where is Igus?" "At the Isle of the Ages, visiting Corsea." Jessica said, adding, "I was there yesterday, Shaun is doing fine." "Thank you Jessica. I cannot wait to see him again." Devon replied. As Arianna served tea and cakes, she could sense that something had Devon concerned.

"All right Devon, spill it." She said, with a smile. "I need to travel to the monastery near Welshire, to see Father Leonis. But the matter is quite urgent and I was hoping Igus could take me through the Cave of Lights." "I will take you Devon, it is the least I can do for my son-in-law." Jessica said. "Why thank you mother..." It was a slip of the tongue, and Devon's face turned red. But Jessica smiled and put her arms around him, "I would be very proud if you called me...Mother." "It would be an honor." Devon replied solemnly.

Gareth welcomed Christopher into the study at Cashell. As the two men sat, Gareth poured some wine. Gareth could see that he had something on his mind. Although Christopher was engaged to Katryn, Gareth did not know him that well.

"So, what is on your mind?" Gareth asked. "I would speak to Katryn of setting a date for the wedding, but I feel I should talk to you first." Christopher replied. "That would be between you and mother, the decision has nothing to do with me." Gareth said, unsure of what he was talking about. "After Katryn and I wed, I do not believe that it would be proper to live at Cashell." Gareth could not believe what he was hearing, "Proper? Have you mentioned this to mother?" "No, that is why I have come to you." Christopher replied. "This is Lady Katryn's home, why would you expect her to leave?" Gareth asked indignantly. "I did not mean to upset you Gareth, but it would not look right for a knight..." "Would not look right!?" Gareth exclaimed, cutting him off., "Did you not think of that when you began courting mother!? Where did you think she would live!?" Gareth now shouted.

Katryn was passing the study and heard Gareth yell. As she stepped into the room, she could see that Gareth was very upset.

"What goes on?" She asked calmly. "It seems that your betrothed is unsure." Gareth replied. "It is not like that Katryn, I just do not believe my son and I should live here after we are wed." Katryn was taken aback. Cashell had been her home for twenty years, "I did not realize you felt that way Christopher. Gareth, will you excuse us, Christopher and I need to talk." Gareth hugged Katryn and left.

Katryn and Christopher had been talking for an hour and not getting anywhere. Though they loved each other, neither would give an inch. It was Christopher's contention that a knight should not gain land by marriage. Land should be earned in battle.

"I do not understand, if we love each other, a tent should suffice." Katryn said. "Exactly my point. Though I do not live in a manor, my home is very comfortable." Christopher argued. Just then, Lisa entered the study. "Good day, I hope I am not interrupting. I wanted to get a book." Lisa said. "Actually Lisa, you may help us settle a problem we are having." Katryn said. "I will try, what is the problem?" Katryn and Christopher both told Lisa their side of the story. Lisa thought about it a few moments when a thought came to her.

"I believe the answer is in the letter of the law. Gareth is the lord of the manor. Though Katryn retains her title, Melanie is the actual Lady Cashell." Christopher and Katryn looked at each other and smiled. Both now realized how simple it was. Lisa could see that the problem had been solved, "So, when are you two getting married?"

Jessica and Devon walked to the Cave of Lights, then into the pool. As they exited the cave near Welshire, Devon immediately knew where he was.

"I played here as a child! I never realized this cave was here!" "Do you wish me to come with you?" Jessica asked. "No mother, I am afraid women are not allowed in the monastery." "Ah yes, I forgot. I will wait for you here then."

Devon walked the road he had walked a thousand times before. As he approached the doors of the monastery, he heard a familiar voice call out to him.

"Devon! What are you doing here!?" "Father Leonis! It is good to see you again!" "Come, come! We must talk!" Leonis said. As the men entered the priory, Leonis led Devon to his living quarters.

"Devon, would you care for some wine?" He asked, as they sat down. "Yes, thank you." "How is Loanna?" "She is fine. You know about our daughter, Brittany, we now also have a son, Shaun." "Two children, I am proud Devon. Katryn once said that you two were meant to be. So tell me, why have you come to Welshire?" Devon smiled at his old teacher. He looked into Leonis' light brown eyes. Though his hair was white, and he had lost a little spring in his walk, his mind was as sharp as ever.

"There is a problem I need to discuss." "Yes Devon, I was sure there was a problem." Leonis said slyly, then continued, "As a child, you would only come to me when you needed something." "I seem to remember that, but there were also times that you would create a problem, just to insure that I was dependent on you." Devon chided. "You have indeed become wise. But those tricks, if you will, were part of the lessons I tried to instill." "Truce!" Devon said, laughing, knowing that sparring with Leonis seldom accomplished anything.

"What would you say about...Ghosts?" Devon now asked. "In my sixty years, I have never met one." Leonis said seriously, then broke out laughing. Devon did not even smile and Leonis stopped laughing, "Are you serious Devon?" "Yes, though I have not seen them personally..." "Them!?" Leonis interrupted. "Yes, them. From all I have heard, a father and son who were killed in battle, years ago, again walk the earth." "I have heard of such things, but only when the dead were not buried in hallowed ground." "That is the problem Father, they were not." Leonis' face turned as white as his hair. He then got up and when to a book shelf, took down a huge book and handed it to Devon.

"This is called, 'The Prelude of the Zenith'. I tried to read it once, but found it full of ghosts, goblins and things that go bump in the night. I thought that it was superstitious bunk, but when you mentioned that the men were not buried in hallowed ground, it came to mind. Feel free to stay in my quarters, I have services to conduct." Leonis said, then got up to leave.

Devon opened the book and began to read. As he read the first few pages, he could see what had Leonis talked of. It indeed seemed to ramble on. Nothing specific, just innuendo along with accounts of disembodied voices on windy nights, 'things that go bump in the night', Devon thought. He read for almost two hours, when a name suddenly sent a chill down his spine... Nihilia! It told of Nihilia's beginnings, it also told of a...crystal!

As Devon read he could not help but to think of his many talks with Igus. Devon found that destiny often seemed as a game of chance, a bet to be won or lost by the luck, or bad luck, of the party involved. But Igus would not waiver on one particular point, "Devon, you must know that all decisions still have to be yours." "So when I wake up tomorrow..." "If you wake up." Igus chided. "Exactly, but awake I do and go on a journey. I come to a fork in the road where destiny is waiting, it knows I am supposed to go right but what if I make a mistake and go left?" Igus would smile that smile of patience and look deep into Devon's eyes and then sigh that sigh, feigning resignation, "Yes Devon, destiny will wait for another fork in the road." Devon could not help but think that Justin Stanton should have stayed in bed that day.

Two hundred years ago, the land had suffered many wars and the dead were commonly buried without priestly blessings. By accident, it seems, one such case was a knight named Justin Stanton. Justin and his wife, Laurie, were on a picnic when they were captured by rebel forces.

Justin begged his attackers to allow his wife safe passage. He breathed a breath of relief as she was given a horse and began to ride away, a breath that turned into a scream as a spear slammed into her back before she was able to kick her horse into a gallop! Stanton screamed obscenities at them, cursing their very existence! They then turned their attention to him! They tortured him for hours. When they satisfied their blood lust, and thought him dead, they threw his limp body into a ravine!

Stanton careened down the embankment, until he came to rest in front of a small cave. He drifted in and out of consciousness, praying for death, but it did not come. Racked with pain, he managed to open his eyes. Though it was growing dark, he could see his shadow in front of him. A campfire must be burning behind me, he thought. He lifted his head and looked to the little cave. He could see an eerie, reddish light, emanating from the cave wall. He managed to crawl toward the light and could now see a glowing, red crystal. He felt his strength returning, and sensed that the crystal was somehow calling him! He crawled into the cave until the crystal was just above his head, and reached to grab it. He could not have expected what happened next!

As the blood from a gaping wound in his hand seemed to join with the crystal, the cave walls began to rumble! The ground beneath his body started to give way! He tried to screamed, but dirt filled his mouth! He thought of Laurie and how the rebels had killed her, then cursed them. He then cursed...God!

When the cave-in was complete, Stanton was at last dead...or was he? He felt no pain and could still feel the crystal in his hand. To his horror, he suddenly realized that he was still alive! Though he felt no pain, he knew he was being crushed by tons of earth and rock! He then became aware of something...else.

He could hear screaming, the words of which blended all together, screeching gibberish that started low at first, but then it permeated his very fiber! Hours wore on and the screams became tolerable, he could finally understand what was being said! Fear clinched his throat as he realized that it was the souls of the dead not buried in hallowed ground! They were being drawn to Stanton as a beacon in the night, searching for direction! He somehow found his own voice and screamed into his earthen tomb, "Leave me be to my own death! I have been given no preference nor special consideration! I have no answers, I am nothing..." Stanton's voice trailed off as he realized that the screaming had stopped! He also found that reason was escaping his mind with every passing second. He was slowly going insane, yet did not know it. The red crystal was somehow keeping him alive, strengthening him. Then, another irrational thought came to him, 'If only I were a mole, I could dig myself out'.

A slight pain began in his hand and spread throughout his body. The pain became excruciating! His body was changing! He felt his teeth changing, and became aware of enhanced hearing and sense of smell. He could feel his hands changing and now realized that he had become a...Mole! He put the crystal in his mouth and began to dig with a fury. He did not know what was happening, but he could now feel the air against his skin, he was free! But now another thought crossed his mind...'Who am I'!?

Devon closed the book, confused. The story had abruptly ended. There must be missing pages, he thought. He had understood what Igus was saying, but now thought that many facts were left out. Devon had more questions than ever. He rose as Leonis returned to the chamber.

"So Devon, what have you found?" "Father, how much of the Prelude is missing?" Leonis took the book and examined it. "It is over a hundred years old Devon, I really could not say." Devon took a white crystal from a pouch and closed his eyes. Leonis watched with interest.

When Devon next opened his eyes, he smiled at Leonis. He loved him as a father, and was excited that he could finally tell him of his adventures.

"Would you travel with me to Cashell?" Devon said, smiling at Leonis. "I cannot leave for such a long journey without..." Devon held his hand up, "Five days, five days and you'll be back." "Five days! It is not possible!" Leonis scoffed. "Come Father, I have much to tell you."

As they walked to the area where Devon had first emerged, Devon told Leonis of the Children of Nature. Leonis was a man who had seen much, and could not believe what he was hearing. When they came to the cave, Leonis could see 'Loanna' waiting.

"Loanna, how good to see you again!" Jessica smiled and Devon introduced her. "This is Jessica, Loanna's mother." Leonis looked shocked, 'Mother?' He thought. "Igus has told me that we are to meet him at the Cave of Lights," Jessica said. "Yes mother, I felt that if Leonis and him could put their heads together, perhaps we could find a way to lay Richard and Robert to rest." "What happens next?" Leonis now asked. "Come, I will lead the way." Jessica answered.

Devon explained about getting into the pool and told Leonis not to worry. Leonis felt as a child when they emerged at the Cave of Lights. He had thought he knew the world, and was now not sure of those tenets.

Christopher and Katryn were sitting in the study as Melanie and Gareth came in. Gareth immediately went to Christopher," I am sorry Christopher. I have many things on my mind..." Christopher held up his hand to quiet Gareth, "No need for apologies. It was wrong of me to bring you into it anyway. As it is, Katryn and I have set a date." "Outstanding!" Gareth exclaimed. "We will contact Devon and ask him to perform the ceremony." Katryn now said. "Have you also decided where you will live." Gareth asked. Katryn smiled slyly, "We considered a tent, but opted to stay at Cashell."

"It is good to finally meet you!" Igus said, as Devon and Jessica led Leonis into the clearing. Leonis was told of Igus' appearance, but was not entirely ready. Though he felt no fear, he found himself staring at Igus, then apologized.

I am sorry to stare Igus..." Igus cut Leonis off. "You would not be the first, nor the last. I have grown accustomed to such things." Igus said graciously, then added, "Come, we will have some refreshments and talk." Igus, who loved to watch the reactions of new comers, floated to the top of the rock, then looked to Leonis.

"I need to sit down!" Leonis exclaimed. Devon smiled, he remembered saying the exact same thing. Arianna, who had been meditating, now opened her eyes, and Igus introduced her.

"Leonis, this is my consort, Arianna." "Arianna, a very pretty name, it is nice to meet you." "Thank you Leonis. How was your trip to the Echo Forest?" "Amazing would be an understatement!" Leonis said smiling. "So Leonis, Devon has said that the Prelude of the Zenith, might shed some light on the ghosts that haunt Joycen and Braxton." Igus now said. "Though I have never entirely read it, I believe the title tells of its contents. The Prelude, deals with what, begins, after death, and the journey to heaven, the Zenith, if you will." "You say heaven, Leonis, there is evil also." Igus chided. "I have thought long and hard about that. I sincerely believe that God has a penchant for forgiveness." Leonis commented. "But Leonis, what of beings such as Nihilia?" Jessica now asked. "Devon has told me of the story in the book. I have considered that evil is created by God as a test. He then watches to see how the good handle it." Devon handed Igus the book. Igus took the book then looked at Leonis and pondered his last statement.

Melanie was walking in the courtyard at Cashell, when she felt she was being watched. Though she could not put her finger on it, she stopped and looked around, nothing. She shrugged it off and walked toward the kitchen. She wanted to see if the cook could make up a picnic lunch for her and Gareth.

When she entered the kitchen, she could see Charles busily peeling potatoes. Though not very tall, he must have weighed three hundred pounds. He was a jolly man, always quick with a joke. His great rounded face always held a smile, as did his deep-set brown eyes.

"Good day Lady Melanie! It is always good to see you!" "Hello Charles, how are you?" "Have you ever known me to be anything but well and happy?" He asked, pulling out a chair for her. "I remember that time that you found out you were losing your hair..." "Ah yes, but then I realized that bald was beautiful!" Charles quickly countered, laughing, "Now, what can I do for you?" "Gareth and I would like to go to the Serenity for a picnic..." "Never understood the need to eat with the bugs, but then again, I do not remember being young and in love." He said, laughing some more. That was Charles, she thought, he never let anyone finish a sentence.

"Perhaps some rabbit and..." "I know, bunny, biscuits and berry pie. You two have had the same picnics for as long as I have known you." He said. She now laughed, he indeed knew them well. She also asked him to prepare a tray with tea and cakes that she could take back to the study.

When she opened the door to leave the kitchen, the figure in front of her was smiling. It took a second for her to recognize him, then she dropped the tray! She tried to scream, but could not. Charles ran to her to see what the matter was. He saw the figure in the doorway and grabbed a knife.

"Get out of here Robert!" Charles shouted, pulling Melanie inside. He then attacked Robert, but to no avail, the knife only found empty air! His momentum carried him forward and he found himself going through the figure at the door! As he lost his balance, he fell face down, impaling himself on the knife in his right hand! Melanie suddenly found her voice and screamed. Sir Philip was the first to arrive.

"What happened my lady!?" He shouted, bending down to turn over Charles' lifeless body. Gareth now ran into the kitchen, and picked Melanie up, who had fallen after Charles pulled her inside. "What is it, my love!?" "Oh Gareth, it was Robert! He was standing at the door...Charles! How is Charles!?" "I am afraid he is dead my lady." Philip said, walking into the kitchen, followed by Katryn and ten knights.

"Melanie! Are you all right!?" Katryn asked, taking her from Gareth's hold. "Poor Charles." Was all she could say. Loanna now entered the kitchen and helped Katryn take Melanie to her bedroom.

"Mother, I am sorry I did not tell you, I did not want to alarm you." Gareth said, walking into the study, followed by Katryn and Lisa. "Though I understand your concern, you should have told us my son." "She is right Gareth." Lisa echoed. "What is to be done?" Katryn asked. "Mother, Richard and Robert are not the only problem. They are but pawns of a being called Nihilia." "Nihilia? A child of nature?" Katryn asked. "No, I do not think so. That is why Devon went to Welshire, he is trying to fine out what he can. Hopefully, he will find some information that will help." "What do we do in the meantime?" Lisa asked Gareth. "I now think the whole Manor should be made aware. Richard and Robert are just ghosts after all. They may be able to scare irrational animals, but we have reason on our side. Until we solve the problem, I suggest that no one go anywhere unaccompanied." Gareth answered, now sorry that he had not told the rest of them of Nihilia from the beginning.

"Father, You should have seen her face! Oh it was rich!" Richard again tried to slap Robert's face but his hand went through it. "Quit calling me that!" He shouted. "You no longer control what I say! In fact, I am now free to..." "To do nothing!" Nihilia now interrupted. Neither Richard, nor Robert had noticed his approach.

"Who told you to go to Cashell!?" Nihilia shouted at Robert. "What do you mean? You said we were to get Devon here. What better way than to go directly to his friends!?" Robert shouted back. Richard looked at Robert, he never saw him belligerent, he almost felt...pride. "You would be roaming aimlessly if not for me! I want you to do as I say!" Nihilia now demanded. "What would you do, kill me!? It seems to me that you need us, as much as we need you!" Robert countered. Unlike Richard and Robert, Nihilia was not without weapons. He pulled the red crystal from a pouch and held it at arms length. A red flash of light hit Robert's eyes.

"I cannot see!" Robert screamed. Nihilia laughed heinously. "Leave him be!" Richard demanded. Nihilia now turned his attention to Richard, "So! You would also challenge me!?" Flames now engulfed Richard! The pain was excruciating and Richard doubled over! Nihilia could hardly contain himself. He laughed maniacally until Richard begged him to stop. "Yes! That is it, beg! You will both crawl to me!"

"What do you think Igus?" Devon asked, as Igus closed the Prelude. "Who am I? What does that mean? If he did not know who he was, then someone had to tell him." Igus pondered out loud. "Yes of course! That is what is missing! After he apparently died, the crystal must have absorbed his soul." Devon now surmised. "But did he die? And who named him?" Leonis asked. "Is that important?" Arianna asked, taking the book from Igus. "It may well be the only thing that does matter. Suppose you woke up tomorrow with no idea of who you were, or for that matter, no idea of your moral character. The first person you met could have total control over you." Leonis said, looking to Devon, "I see what you are saying, but what if that is not the case? What if the crystal itself was an entity of some kind?"

On the Isle of the Ages, Shaun was trying to understand why he could not go to his father and help him. He was learning his lessons faster then any other child and was aware of things that other fledglings knew little of. Artemus was allowing Shaun a latitude that was not given other children. Corsea had told Igus of Shaun's development, and both wondered how it was all possible. Yes, Shaun was indeed special. Artemus and the Elders were having a hard time keeping up with the fledgling. Shaun had a capacity for learning that was unequaled. Artemus realized that Shaun could fully develop by his third year!

"Artemus, is not Igus interfering by helping my father?" Shaun asked. "Igus knows well the difference between listening and taking action. It is a fine line, one that should not be crossed. For example, when you told Devon to 'Beware Nihilia', you walked that line." "Direct help then is not allowed, but we can help indirectly?" "Of course, that is what the Children of Nature do. They are given powers to preserve the balance of nature, but try to avoid judging the people you encounter."

Shaun walked to the Tree of Lessons where Corsea was sitting. Shaun knew of Corsea's past and thought he might ask him about crossing the line.

"Corsea, may I talk with you?" "Of course my young friend. Something is troubling you and you have questions, right?" Shaun smiled at him, "Yes, but if I upset you, please let me know." Corsea patted the ground, "Sit down and ask away." "Artemus has said that direct interference of human affairs was not allowed. Yet, by not interfering, my father may be hurt, possibly killed. When you used your gifts, unwisely, were you not interfering with destiny? Did you think of the people you may have hurt?." "Not until Artemus brought me back here." "What do you mean?" "The real punishment was the remorse I felt when I finally realized how many people I hurt. But that is not the issue, is it? You question the wisdom of letting nature run its course, correct?" "I suppose so, I just do not want father hurt." "Shaun, you feel something that took me years to understand, love. Though love is probably the most important thing in nature, do not let love cloud your judgment. There is a grand scheme to the universe, and each person has a destiny." "Artemus has taught me of destiny, however, how do I know it is not my destiny to help father?" Corsea smiled at Shaun. He, of course, had not only questioned destiny, he challenged it!

"We children are given our powers for the purpose of balancing nature, do not confuse balance with control." Corsea answered. "He is right young one." Shaun and Corsea looked to Artemus, who was now walking up to them.

"I know he is right Artemus, but I cannot help but worry." Shaun said, as tears welled in his eyes. Artemus bent down and picked him up, "You have done all you can. Your warning to your father gives him a chance."

Jessica, Devon and Leonis walked to Cashell. They talked of the missing pages, and what they may have contained. When they reached Cashell, Gareth asked them to the study. Katryn Lisa, Loanna were already there. Devon kissed Loanna, then handed Gareth the book and gave him a quick run down.

"The ghost of Robert was seen here two days ago. Charles attacked him with a knife, but was killed when he fell on it." Katryn said sadly. "Have there been any sightings since?" Devon asked. "Nothing." She said. As if on cue, Robert suddenly appeared! Lisa let out a stifled scream and Gareth instinctively drew his sword! Devon was the first to speak.

"Be calm! He cannot hurt us!" Devon shouted, then looked to Robert, "You have no place here Robert, be gone!" Robert had no voice without Nihilia's aid and could only mouth words. There seemed to be great pain in his eyes as he mouthed, "I am sorry, please help me." Then vanished! As everyone started to calm, Leonis spoke.

"First the Children of Nature, now this!" "Yes, old friend, a lot to digest in one day!" Devon said, laughing. His laughter broke the mood and Gareth joined in. Everyone laughed and settled back into their seats, Katryn then served tea.

"He looked to be pleading for help." Jessica said calmly. "But what can be done? Better yet, can he be believed?" Gareth asked. "Why do you say that Gareth?" Devon asked. "When he appeared to Melanie, he was smiling Devon." "So you think it was a ploy for my benefit?" "Perhaps, but why?" "I think it is obvious." Leonis now interjected. Every eye looked to Leonis. "What do you mean Leonis?" Jessica asked. "No matter who controls the Timlons, they must still realize they need a Priest for absolution." Leonis replied.

Igus opened his eyes as a thought crossed his mind. "I have never had a sense of Nihilia Arianna, that has bothered me since Devon first asked about him." Igus lamented. "Actually Igus, I have had the same thought. How did Shaun know?" "Maybe the paternal bond makes him more receptive. Perhaps we should search for Nihilia, talk with him." Suddenly, Artemus appeared at the base of the Great Rock. Igus and Arianna floated down to greet him.

"Welcome Artemus! What brings you to the forest?" "You Igus." "What do you mean?" "You were just about to go to Lost Man's Ravine, correct?" "Yes, I want to meet Nihilia, to talk with him." "I cannot allow that." Artemus said sternly. "I do not understand. I just want to find out..." "No Igus! You want to gauge his power." Igus looked at the ground. Artemus was right. He had planned to measure Nihilia's hold on the Timlons. "You must not seek out Nihilia, it would not help anyway." "Why do you say that Artemus?" Arianna now asked. "The power that Nihilia controls is not of nature. I will not tell you anything more." With that, Artemus closed his eyes and faded. "Why would he forbid us to look for Nihilia?" "I do not know Arianna, but he has tied our hands. Devon will be on his own now."

"So Robert, did you ask for help as I told you?" "Yes Nihilia, but, except for their first reaction, they were not scared." "I told you to let me go! I would have scared them silly!" Richard boasted. "You do have a tiny mind Richard! Do you think they would want to help you!? You tried to kill Melanie!" Nihilia sneered. "You what!?" Robert shouted. "Oh I do love these family meetings. You mean you do not know that your dear, sweet father stabbed her and threw her off a balcony!?" "Shut up Nihilia! They had just killed you Robert! I had brought Melanie to the balcony as a bargaining tool, but too late. When I saw you struck down, I went insane!" Robert looked at Richard and a thought came to him, "You do not hate me, do you father?" Nihilia did not like the direction the conversation had taken. Suddenly, Richard and Robert found themselves again engulfed in flames! "What have we done Nihilia!?" Richard shrieked. "Surprisingly little! But that ends now! Richard you will go to Braxton, Robert you go to Joycen! Create as much havoc as possible! Now go!" Nihilia commanded.

Geoffrey had enough. Though no one had been hurt, he tired of the screams in the middle of the night. He and five of his knights arrived at Cashell the morning after Devon, Jessica and Leonis returned to Cashell. As he entered the study, he could see Gareth reading a book.

"Is there nothing we can do!?" Were the first words out of Geoffrey's mouth. Katryn poured him some wine as he sat down. "Thank you Katryn. I apologize for my actions." "Quite understandable Geoffrey. No need to apologize." She said smiling. "I was going to send this message to Braxton." Gareth said, handing him a paper. Geoffrey read it and raised his brows.

"Ignore the ghosts!?" Geoffrey exclaimed. "Yes my friend, ignore them!" Gareth said smiling. "I do not understand." "They cannot harm you! They can only frighten you by their grotesque appearance." Gareth insisted. "I see what you mean. I will take this to one of my knights." "Allow me, I have to give the new cook instructions anyway." Katryn said. "Thank you." "As to what can be done, we are trying figure that out" Devon now said. Geoffrey shook Devon's hand and now looked around the room. He did not see everyone when he first walked in.

"Ian! I must be losing my mind! How are you?" "Fine, but do not be concerned, we have all lost a piece of our minds." Ian laughed. "And Father Leonis, I have not seen you in years, what brings you all the way here?" "You would be surprised." Leonis said slyly, looking at Devon. "How are the women holding up?" Geoffrey asked. "Melanie had a bad scare when Robert first appeared. Charles was killed when he fell on a knife, trying to protect her." Gareth answered. "I am sorry to hear that. Have you actually seen him?" Geoffrey asked. "Yes, there were six of us here in the study, just yesterday. Robert appeared and asked for help." Devon said. "He talked to you!?" "No, not really, he mouthed the words." Devon answered as Jessica and Loanna now entered the study.

"Gareth, we left the children with Melanie, she said she wants to see you." Loanna said, sitting next to Devon. "Of course, I will go to her in a moment. While I am gone, Devon and Leonis will tell you what we have learned since our last meeting Geoffrey." With that, Gareth left the room. Devon and Leonis told Geoffrey of the Prelude.

"Devon, it sounds like there is nothing that anyone can do." Geoffrey said. "I believe that I need to go to the ravine." Devon said somberly. "Not alone!" Loanna exclaimed. Devon took her hand. Leonis now spoke, "There is not an army in the world that can help, Loanna, Nihilia is a shape shifter. He will only be found when he wants to be found. I just wish we knew what was on the missing pages of the Prelude." "But alone, what chance will he have!?" Geoffrey asked. "You are not going Devon!" Loanna again asserted. "Not going where Devon?" Gareth asked, coming back into the study.

"I need to find Nihilia, talk to him, try to get him to release Richard and Robert." "No Devon! You cannot go alone!" Loanna again insisted. "He will not be alone Loanna, I will go with him," Leonis said with a smile. Gareth also agreed with Loanna, "Devon, Leonis, your bravery is admirable, but as your friend I could not allow you..." Devon held up a hand, cutting Gareth off, "We do not make this decision lightly my friend. You are free to have troops near the ravine, but we will enter alone." Gareth loved Devon as a brother and feared for his safety. Yet he could see that Devon was right and hiding something? "There is something you are not telling me Devon." "Not exactly Gareth, I believe that the missing pages of the Prelude of the Zenith have to do with religion." "Religion?" "Yes, something or somebody answered Stanton's question." "Yes, Stanton, I forgot that he and Nihilia are the same." Gareth said. " "For now, I think we should travel to Joycen." Devon finished.

Though barely over a year old, Shaun knew many things. His lessons however had slowed over the past week. Artemus was concerned and went to him, "I understand your concern for your father, but you must let it go and concentrate." "I know Artemus, perhaps you could ease my mind, tell me what is to happen." "You know I cannot, please do not ask." "Then you do know, do you not?" Shaun said slyly. "You are learning not only of nature, but also of trickery." "When my family visited, my father told me that it was very hard to get an answer from Igus. 'He answers questions with questions', he told me. I was simply fishing, and am sorry for the deceit." "I accept your apology. I will tell you this, no matter what the future holds for Devon, know that his actions may help countless souls."

Igus and Arianna sat talking about Nihilia and Devon. Artemus had tied their hands, by forbidding any interference. "Arianna, I have no idea at all of the upcoming confrontation!" Igus said feeling totally frustrated. "It is the same for me, my love. It is as if Lost Man's Ravine has a magical shield surrounding it." "Yes, but who is causing it? Artemus? Nihilia?" Arianna asked, "Perhaps even Focura. But why?" "I think we should go to the caves near the ravine." "But Igus, would that not be interfering?" "We will walk a fine line, but not interfere." Igus finished. They then headed to the Cave of Lights.

Gareth assembled his troops and headed to Joycen. It was decided that Lisa and Katryn would stay behind and care for Brittany, Michael and Rebecca. Loanna, Jessica and Melanie would accompany the forces. Devon felt that Robert might try to search out Melanie, thereby giving him a chance to communicate.

As they entered Joycen, Devon could see Igus and Arianna at the mouth of the cave. Gareth also saw them and sent his men ahead as he dismounted. Devon stopped the coach that carried Jessica, Loanna and Melanie. Igus and Arianna walked to them and Igus spoke.

"Artemus has forbidden the Children of Nature to help. I do not know why, but we are bound by his decision." "Then it is as I have known all along. Leonis and I will meet with Nihilia alone." Devon said, as his shoulders slumped. "But Artemus has not contacted me." Jessica said hopefully. Igus and Arianna looked at each other, a confused look covered their faces.

"I thought that direct interference was not allowed anyway." Gareth said. "Yes my friend, but we have always had some latitude, a gray area if you will." Igus explained. "You mean like the time you helped me save Gareth?" Devon asked. "Exactly. We were also able to protect Melanie's unborn child. There are many ways we have helped, but in this case, Artemus has spoken." "But not to me. I wonder why?" Jessica pondered.

Igus and Arianna walked back to the cave, where they watched as Gareth and the others continued on to Joycen. As they sat in silence, Igus thought back to the weeks that followed Shaun's birth.

"Arianna, why do you suppose Artemus told us to show Devon, Loanna and Brittany how to use the crystals?" "I do not know, though I expect it has more to do with Shaun." She conceded. "I suppose, but why Devon? I understood Loanna and Brittany, they are after all, offspring of a child of nature." Igus stated. "Actually, I see your point. But the elders have always done what they thought best." "No, I think something is missing." Igus said, as he closed his eyes.

Gareth's group had only traveled a couple of miles when Jessica heard Igus. He asked that she bring Leonis back to the cave. Jessica asked the others to continue on, then she and Leonis went to Igus. When they climbed up to where Igus and Arianna were waiting, Igus offered them refreshments and turned to Leonis.

"I am sorry to interrupt your journey, but I have a few questions. Leonis, when Devon's parents died, how did he come to live at the monastery?" Igus asked. Leonis looked to Jessica then back to Igus, "As I recall, a young girl brought him to me." Leonis said, accepting the tea that Igus had offered. "Was she of any relation to Devon?" Igus asked. "No, she said she was walking to Welshire when she came upon rebels attacking a wagon. She said that she stayed hidden until after the attack, then went to see if she could help after the rebels were out of sight. Apparently, the father was just barely alive and asked her to take care of the boy, Devon Gable." Leonis finished. "Did you not think that strange Leonis? The rebels of that war had no regard for life at all, they would have killed the child." Igus asserted. "I must admit I considered it unusual, but still thanked God for his mercy." Leonis answered, then asked, "What are you driving at Igus?" "I am not sure, but I have thought about Devon's ability to learn, and something my brother told me. Thank you Leonis, Jessica, please escort the good Father back to the others."

As Joycen Manor came into view, they could see Sir Douglas racing toward them. When Douglas reached them, Ian asked the others to go ahead and dismounted.

"Lord Ian, I am so glad you have returned! Robert has been seen everywhere!" Douglas shouted. "Calm down Douglas! Did you not receive the message to ignore him?" "Yes my lord, but when he realized we were unafraid, he started scaring the animals! At least twenty men have been injured by the live stock!" "How is Jean and Frances!?" "They are fine sir, I told my lady that she and your son must stay indoors until the crisis is over." "Come, we will continue this in the drawing room."

This was Melanie's first visit to Joycen in six years. She was suddenly aware that she was shivering. Loanna saw, and went to her. "There is nothing to fear, Robert is but an apparition." Loanna said, putting her arm around Melanie's shoulders. "I know that, but I was just thinking of what Richard done to me those years ago."

Jean now came in with food and wine. Ian kissed her and took the tray from her. "How are you Jean?" Gareth asked. "I am fine, though I will be better when the ghosts find another home." She said somberly. "Leonis and I will go to the ravine tomorrow, perhaps we will find an answer then." Devon offered. Leonis looked up from the Prelude and added, "Yes, I believe that just one piece of the puzzle is missing. Find that, and we can better gauge what options are at our disposal."

Jessica was still not sure why Artemus had not come to her. She considered contacting him, but was afraid he would tell her not to interfere. A thought now crossed her mind. She decided to talk to Devon and Leonis alone, after the others were asleep. As they left the study, Jessica told them to meet her in the graveyard.

"Why the graveyard Jessica?" Leonis asked, as they walked up to her. "Hallowed ground." "Yes, of course! Richard and Robert would not come here. So mother, what did you want?" Devon asked. "Artemus has not yet told me not to intervene, I think I am can help in some way, without directly interfering." Jessica replied. "What can you do? I do not have any idea what we will be up against tomorrow." Devon said. "After studying the Prelude, I think you will be surrounded by illusion. I think that may be Nihilia's only real weapon against physical beings." She answered. "I have considered that also, but what to do against something that is not real?" Leonis asked. Jessica did not give any warnings, simply saying, "Let us see what you will do!"

Jessica took a purple crystal from a pouch and closed her eyes. A soft violet glow surrounded Devon and Leonis. Both men were suddenly aware of all sorts of horrors! They both began to scream and fell to their knees! "Do not be afraid, these things are not real!" Jessica yelled. "But Jessica..." "Do not be afraid!" Jessica demanded, cutting Devon off. Devon and Leonis watched in horror as monsters ripped arms and legs off of screaming men and women! They watched as a demon bit off a knight's head! "This is what I believe Nihilia has store for you and Leonis tomorrow." Jessica said, slowly opening her eyes. Devon and Leonis were near tears. Jessica apologized, but was sure that they would be better equipped for their meeting with Nihilia.

They arrived at the ravine just as the sun was coming up. Devon and Leonis had decided to walk into the ravine, horses could be scared. Loanna kissed Devon and told him to be careful. The two men started down the incline and reached the floor of the ravine in twenty minutes. When they disappeared into the underbrush, Jessica closed her eyes.

"I have no sense of either of them!" She shouted. "What are you saying, mother!?" Loanna asked. "Something or someone is preventing me from contact!" "Then they are truly alone!" Gareth said, now wishing he had gone with them.

They traveled about a mile into the ravine and noticed that the sky had gotten darker. Devon suggested that they stop to rest. The going was made hard by thick underbrush. Devon gave Leonis some water and looked around. He looked to the west and could see the bluff that Stanton must have been thrown from. Suddenly, the two men were no longer alone! Richard and Robert appeared before them and Devon smiled.

"So, you do not tired of the game I see." Devon said to Richard. "You think this is a game!?" Richard yelled. Devon was slightly taken aback, he did not realize that they would have voices. "It seems to me that you wanted me here, so here I am." Devon said calmly, then added, "This is Father Leonis." "Why do you haunt the manors of my friends?" Leonis asked. "Enough!" A voice suddenly thundered, visibly shaking Devon and Leonis. Both men and the two ghosts watched as Nihilia took form. Devon and Leonis were not quite prepared for the creature that stood before them. Jessica had helped however, and each man held his ground. Devon now sensed something...familiar about Nihilia, but could not put a finger on it.

"So, you must be Nihilia. Why have you sent these two poor souls to haunt the manors." Devon asked as calm as he could. Nihilia did not like their calm demeanor, "You Priest! I knew you would come!" "Why Devon?" Leonis' asked. Nihilia transformed after Leonis' question. Devon was shocked, but did not show it. Leonis, however, gasped. Nihilia was the image of Bernard Chapman as Chapman took his last breath! Devon could see Richard smile, but saw something else in Robert' eyes.

"I blessed Bernard Chapman's grave, after I helped bury him, he is of no use to you!" Devon exclaimed. Nihilia now shifted to Martin, the arrow still embedded in his chest! "You have missed another, I also blessed Martin's grave!" Devon said defiantly. "That is the point Priest! Two souls were stole from me, I will now have yours!" Nihilia bellowed. Devon now realized what was going on! By blessing the graves of Martin and Bernard, Nihilia had lost two unwitting pawns! Devon now looked to Nihilia's eyes and saw pure hatred!

"So Nihilia, what is your plan for me?" Devon said, looking to Leonis. "Plan!? You have taken that which is not yours! When Richard and Robert were thrown into the ravine, I saw the future...my revenge! I buried them and waited six long years and now you are here!" "Do you know who you are?" Leonis asked, trying to get Nihilia off balance. Nihilia turned his attention to Leonis. "Of course! I am Nihilia!" He roared. "Who named you?" Leonis now asked, noticing Devon attempting to talk with Robert.

"Robert, you have asked for help, is that for Nihilia's sake, or you and your father's?" Devon asked in a whisper. Robert knew that they were being used by Nihilia and answered softly. "Help us Father." Devon looked to Richard who was no longer smiling, he too wanted absolution. Devon kneeled and began to pray.

Leonis was verbally sparring with Nihilia and winning! As he questioned Nihilia, Leonis kept moving to his left until Nihilia could not see Devon. "Do you know someone named Laurie?" The question took Nihilia completely by surprise! Leonis thought Nihilia was going to collapse!

Devon was not paying any attention to what was going on behind him, he had asked Robert and Richard to kneel and pray with him, Robert had done so immediately, then Richard relented and kneeled also.

Leonis could see that Devon had accomplished much and decided one more question was in order, "Nihilia, who is Justin Stanton?" Nihilia crashed to his knees holding his head in his hands! A battle was suddenly being waged inside his mind as memories tried to surface. Leonis left Nihilia and walked to Devon, kneeled beside him and began to pray.

"Dear God, these souls have come before you for absolution. They have repented and ask that you allow them your grace. We now ask that you take them back into your heart. Amen." Devon finished.

A light now broke through the dark sky, and Robert and Richard found themselves enveloped by a warm, soft glow. Devon and Leonis watched as the two men were healed. Their wounds were no longer evident. Even the scar on Richard's face disappeared. They now saw a figure taking shape, a beautiful young woman with brown hair down to her waist. She went to Richard and put her arms around him. Richard's eyes were filled with tears, as he introduced Robert to his mother, Lynda. Robert then turned to Leonis and Devon.

"Thank you both, you have given me back my mother and father." "It could not have been so without your faith." Leonis said. Richard then walked to Devon and extended his hand. Devon took Richard's hand and was amazed that he could indeed hold it! Richard then put his other arm around Devon, "We did not deserve your help, God bless you both." He said, then shook Leonis' hand. Devon and Leonis watched now as the three spirits began to fade. Lynda was the last to speak. "Destroy the Crimson Crystal."

Leonis and Devon turned to see that Nihilia was still writhing on the ground. Devon decided to try and reach Stanton. He was in there somewhere and Devon hoped that he could somehow reach him. He took a blue crystal from his pouch and sat in front of Nihilia with his eyes closed. Leonis watched in amazement as Nihilia was now bathed in a soft blue light. Devon did not realize that by trying to reach Stanton, he was also helping Nihilia!

Suddenly, Nihilia was back in control and let loose a hundred different grotesque, screaming phantoms! Devon stood his ground but could see Leonis wavering. He jumped to his feet and grabbed Leonis. "Run!" He shouted. Leonis started to run and suddenly stopped, putting his hands to his ears. Devon went to him. "It is not real! Do not listen, just run!" Devon yelled over the din

Leonis stumbled forward and Devon grabbed his shoulders before he fell! Devon then practically carried him a half mile to the opening where they entered the ravine! As they exited the underbrush and began the ascent to the main road, Devon at last breathed! He could see Loanna running toward him, and rushed to hold her.

Are you alright!?" Loanna shouted. "Yes, my love, the first battle has been won!" Gareth went to Leonis, who had dropped to his knees, and helped him up, "Are you all right Father?" "Yes, but I think I am getting too old for this!" He laughed. "Come let us return to Joycen." Ian suggested.

Leonis and Devon told of Nihilia's attempt to scare them and how Richard and Robert prayed for absolution. As they reached the drawing room at Joycen, Devon told them of Lynda's message.

"Destroy the Crimson Crystal? Where would you find it to destroy it?" Gareth asked. "That is what is in the missing pages of the Prelude, no doubt." Leonis said. "Why even bother? The ghosts have been put to rest." Lisa countered. Loanna now shook her head in agreement, "She is right, you have helped Richard and Robert find peace, why bother with Nihilia?" Devon put his hand on Loanna's arm. "His name is Justin Stanton." He said quietly. They all looked at him and understood, then Gareth added, "Not only that, but it would now seem that we would never be free from the threat of ghosts until Stanton is freed." "Tomorrow, Jessica, Loanna, Leonis and myself will go to the caves near the ravine. I think another visit with Igus is in order." Devon said, still trying to figure out what was so familiar about Nihilia.

"Artemus, father is safe!" Shaun shouted. "So he is." Artemus said with a smile, then added, "But he still has to destroy the Crimson Crystal." "Will Igus be able to help this time?" "No, I am afraid not. But know this, your father is a very strong willed man. Trust that he will not go to face Nihilia ill-prepared." "Yes, I understand." Shaun said, smiling for the first time in a week. "Now, I believe you have been a little lax. It is time you got back to your studies." Artemus said, taking Shaun's hand.

Gareth had his troops continue on to Cashell when he stopped below the caves near the ravine. "Igus has returned to the forest." Jessica said. "Loanna, go ahead with Gareth to Cashell. Leonis, Jessica and I will go to the forest, through the cave." Devon said, putting his arms around Loanna. "Yes my love, I will get Brittany and go to the Parish." She said, giving him a kiss.

The three of them watched as the others rode on, then went to the caves. Leonis was almost giddy as they went into the pool. They could see Arianna and Igus standing at the base of the rock as they came into the clearing. Igus went to Devon and put his arms around him.

"Devon, your resolve has always amazed me!" "Once again, I have mother to thank. She helped Leonis and I see through the fear, and after all, that is all Nihilia controls." "Perhaps not. Come, let us have some tea and talk." Igus said.

"What are you saying?" Devon asked as he sat down. "I have thought hard and long about Nihilia. The Prelude suggests that he can also physically attack, if the need arose." Igus replied. "I also was aware of that in the ravine." Leonis added. Devon looked at Leonis and Igus. A shiver suddenly went down his spine. "If he could physically attack us, why the illusions?" Devon asked. "Nihilia has been doing the same thing for two-hundred years. He probably has never considered it." Jessica noted. "Perhaps, like the time Igus attacked Corsea on the Isle of the Ages. Corsea had never done anything physical and was no match for Igus' onslaught." Arianna suggested. "Yes, that is why you must be careful during your next confrontation." Igus warned Devon.

Nihilia was dumbfounded. Devon had managed to steal two more souls. Nihilia swore revenge. "Perhaps I will send a ghoul or two to his home." He thought out loud. "I think not Nihilia." A sweet, soft feminine voice said. Nihilia looked around, but saw no one. "Who dares to play games with me!?" He shouted into the sky. "It is not a game. You will no longer able to leave Lost Man's Ravine." The voice answered. "I will not be a pawn for anyone! Who are you!?" He demanded. "That is of no importance. The final confrontation will take place here. When the time comes, you must look to your heart." "Who are you that dares try to control me!?" Nihilia demanded again. No answer came.

Nihilia walked to the north end of the ravine and began to climb out. But it was as the voice said. Pushing as hard as he could, he could not leave! There was an invisible barrier stopping him! He then ran the length of the west border and found it to was impassible. Panic began to set in. Devon apparently had some very powerful friends and Nihilia decided to...hide.

Devon could see that Igus was whispering to Jessica. Ah yes, Devon smiled to himself, the secrets of the children. Igus then asked Arianna to take Leonis back to Welshire. Devon and Jessica walked to the Parish. It was a walk that Devon was glad to be taking. His mind was exhausted and, were he asked directly, he would admit that he was...afraid. Jessica sensed Devon's fear but let it be. He would talk when he was ready. As they came into the meadow, Devon suddenly fell to his knees! Jessica went to his side, but he pushed her away!

"Devon! What is wrong!? Let me help you!" Jessica shouted as she retrieved a blue crystal from her pouch. Devon was holding his head in his hands and Jessica sat down beside him and closed her eyes. A light blue glow surrounded Devon and Jessica found herself being drawn into his mind! 'This cannot be happening!', she thought. The healing crystal had somehow connected their minds and Jessica could now see what was paralyzing Devon.

She watched as Devon, who was dressed in full battle armor, was in a life or death battle with a monster! As Devon attacked, Jessica could see a bright red glow emanating from the monster's hand! A burst of energy hit Devon square in the chest and he went down! Devon jumped back to his feet and wielded a broadsword like a trained warrior! He slashed at the monster's mid-section then whirled as the monster dodged the first thrust. As he whirled, Devon was able to come underneath and drive the sword deep into the monster's chest! The battle was over! Or was it?

Jessica watched as Devon turned to walk away. The monster was playing possum and Jessica could only watch as it opened its hand revealing a blood red crystal. The monster's face held a smile as Devon was suddenly consumed in flame! "No!" Jessica now screamed into the air.

The scream jarred Devon and he slowly came around. He could see Jessica holding the blue crystal. She seemed locked in a trance and Devon shook her. When she did not come around, Devon he shook her harder. Slowly, Jessica regained her senses.

"Devon! You are alive!" Jessica exclaimed, still dazed, "I could not help you when that monster attacked you!" Devon stood and helped her up, "You were in my dream? Then you saw Nihilia and how hideous he is." "That was Nihilia!? Devon, I cannot believe that you and Leonis stood up to him!" Devon put his arms around Jessica, "All thanks to you. Your visions in the graveyard prepared us. But even more important is that I now remember! You go on to the Parish, I need to talk to Igus."

Devon saw that Arianna had already returned from Welshire. She and Igus were talking as he came into the clearing.

"Devon I thought you were going home." Igus said, as Devon walked up to them. "I had to see you, to tell you that I remember the dream." "What dream Devon?" Igus asked. "The dream that brought me here." Devon replied. Igus looked surprised, "I do not understand, I thought the dream was just destiny's way of giving you direction." "It seems it has become reality. The monster in my dream was Nihilia." Arianna was confused, but needed to ask a question, "In your dream, did you defeat Nihilia?" "No, but I believe I did learn how to. The Crimson Crystal is what Stanton grabbed all those years ago." Devon now said confidently. "Then you will go back to the ravine?" Igus asked. "Yes, the sooner the better. We will all be safer once Stanton is freed." Igus suddenly looked nervous, "I think you should go home first. Spend some time with your family." Devon could not see the logic in putting the confrontation off. But he could see that Igus was hiding something, "All right Igus, if you think that is best. But two days from now, I travel to the ravine." Devon finished and walked to the Parish.

As Devon approached the Parish, he could see Brittany running toward him. "Daddy! Mommy, daddy is home!" She hollered. Devon scooped her up in his arms as she reached him. "How is my little girl?" Devon asked. "I am not little daddy!" She giggled. Loanna met them at the door and took Brittany from Devon.

"It is good to be home." Devon said, closing the door behind him. "I know what you are saying." Loanna agreed, then kissed Devon's cheek. "Where is your mother?" Devon now asked. "She said she was going to the Hollow Hills, something to do with Igus." "Yes of course, they seemed to have a secret before I left the forest. Did Jessica tell you of the dream?" "Yes, but she assured me you were fine. Devon, do you have to go back to the ravine?" Loanna asked, knowing he did. Devon took Loanna's hand, "Though I do not wish to risk providence, I am afraid I must." Loanna put Devon's hand to her cheek, "I understand."

Devon and Loanna took Brittany to Cashell. She would stay there while Devon and Loanna went to Joycen. Gareth and Philip accompanied them. As they crossed the border of Joycen, Loanna could see Jessica waving from the caves and told the others to ride ahead. Loanna dismounted as her mother approached.

"So, Devon goes to face Nihilia again. He is not prepared you know." Jessica stated as fact. "What do you mean? He defeated him before..." Jessica interrupted her, "No my daughter! Nihilia was over confident last time, even Devon knows that. This time Devon will need to become a hunter." "He is a strong willed man, he will succeed..." Jessica again cut Loanna off, "I have not come here to spar with my daughter! I love Devon and wish him well. But he will need...luck. Give him this, it has always given me luck. I must return to the forest, tell Devon to be careful and believe his eyes." Jessica hugged Loanna and walked to the caves.

In the study at Joycen, Gareth, Ian and Philip were having wine and talking of following Devon into the ravine. "I say we take thirty knights and follow a mile behind him." Philip suggested. "I agree. Then as soon as Devon makes contact, we attack and make short work of Nihilia." Ian said. Gareth also agreed, "It is settled then. Philip, go to Douglas and have him prepare for tomorrow."

The morning came all too quickly for Devon. As he, Loanna and Gareth rode to the ravine, they found that there was little to talk of, it had all been said. At one point, Devon almost turned his horse to run. But he thought of Stanton and the poor souls that Nihilia still had trapped and rode on. Shrouded in the morning fog, the ravine looked ominous. The three dismounted and Devon shook Gareth's hand.

Thank you my friend, hopefully, I will see you shortly." "You will Devon. Be careful and stay safe." Devon then turned to Loanna, who had tears in her eyes, "Do not cry my love, all will be fine." Loanna put her arms around Devon and held tight, "I love you. I know you have to do this, but be careful and believe your eyes." She released her hold on him and took a gray crystal from her pouch, "That is what mother said when she told me to give you this for luck." "What a time for a riddle, but thank you." Devon mused. He then put his arms around Loanna and kissed her, "I love you." He said, then started down the incline. In a few moments, he was out of sight.

When Gareth estimated that Devon was out of earshot, he hollered for the knights to assemble. Loanna was surprised to see knights appear from behind the trees.

"Gareth! Somehow, I knew you would not let him go alone!" Loanna exclaimed. "He is as my brother Loanna, we will protect him." Gareth said, as he directed the men to enter the ravine. One by one, the knights tried, but were repelled! Gareth ran to the entrance and found that he too could not get past the invisible barrier either! "Someone has decided that Devon do this alone!" Gareth shouted. He then went to Loanna who was softly crying and held her. Devon would be alone.

As Devon walked through the underbrush, he tried to concentrate on the gray crystal. He could feel it vibrate, but nothing happened. He decided to put it away and consider his options against Nihilia. Devon realized that physically he was no match for Nihilia, he would have to rely on trickery. What Devon did not realize, is that Nihilia was afraid of him.

Devon searched the ravine for hours, watching for anything that seemed out of place. As darkness fell on the ravine, Devon stopped and made camp. The light of the fire made every tree and bush appear to be alive. He had not planned for a long stay and was woefully short of supplies. As he brewed some tea, he decided he would head back first thing in the morning. Another thought came to Devon, and he was saddened. His mind drifted back to the discussion he had with Igus, prior to the battle with Corsea.

"Do you think me a coward!?" Igus asked indignantly. "In your own words Igus, 'We have never labeled each other.' Just answer me, can the seal be replaced!?" Devon demanded. "No, I have searched for an ebony crystal, but cannot find one." "Then there is no recourse, Corsea must be destroyed." Igus looked down at Devon. Disappointment filled his eyes, "You sound callous my friend. Would you find killing so easy?" Devon lowered his head. The thought of killing had never crossed his mind.

Devon's mind drifted back to the present. The confrontation with Nihilia was at hand. There could be no room for doubt at this juncture.

As the night dragged on, Devon took out the gray crystal and again could feel it vibrate. 'Useless', he thought. Suddenly, a sweet, soft voice, was in Devon's mind, "Look around Devon, see what is real." Devon now felt the crystal vibrate stronger and he peered into the darkness. His heart nearly leaped into his throat when his eyes settled on Nihilia, not five feet away! Nihilia was the form of a bush and staring intently at Devon. Devon had found him, but what to do?

Igus sat upon the Great Rock meditating. He decided he must help Devon and opened his eyes. Suddenly, Artemus was standing at the base of the rock.

"No Igus! You have been warned not to interfere!" Artemus scolded. "Devon is alone! I do not understand why you allow him no aid!" Igus exclaimed as he floated to the forest floor. Artemus smiled at Igus, "No aid young one, what of the gray crystal?" "You knew? Then why did you not stop me?" Igus asked sheepishly. "Had you or Jessica tried to tell Devon how to use the crystal, I would not have allowed it." Artemus chided. "Will Devon be able to defeat Nihilia?" Igus now asked. "All in good time. But for now know that Devon must do this alone. Also know that his destiny hangs in the balance." Artemus said as he began to fade.

Devon's mind was reeling! He tried to not look into Nihilia's eyes, fearful that Nihilia would know that he had been found. As Devon calmly sipped his tea, he could see a red glow in Nihilia's hand. 'The Crimson Crystal!' he thought with excitement. Many thoughts went through Devon's mind. He considered getting a little closer and try to kick the crystal from Nihilia's grasp. Then Devon thought of a lesson Igus had taught him. He put the gray crystal into his pouch and retrieved an opaque crystal. Though no longer able to see Nihilia, he kept an eye on the 'bush'.

Devon now closed his eyes and the crystal began to glow. Nihilia watched with little interest. 'Leave the fool play with his toy', he thought. Nihilia, however, was not prepared for what happened next. Devon quickly covered his already closed eyes with his empty hand. The crystal shot out a blinding light that made Nihilia scream out in pain! Nihilia lost all concentration and was no longer able to remain camouflaged! Devon seized the moment and rushed Nihilia, knocking him to the ground! Devon grabbed for the Crimson Crystal which Nihilia held tightly in his right hand. Nihilia was losing control, Stanton was resurfacing! Devon, who was struggling to break the vise-like grip that Nihilia had on the crystal, did not notice Nihilia's features changing!

"What do you do Priest!?" Devon did not recognize the voice and looked at the transforming face. "Stanton!?" Devon shouted. Stanton's mind was slowly emerging, and trying to figure out why a Priest would attack him. "Yes, I am Stanton, but who are you..." He began, but was cut off by Devon. "Stanton, let loose your right hand! It is the only thing that will save you!" Devon screamed, realizing that Stanton was already reverting back to Nihilia. "Dear God, give me the strength to stop this madness!" Devon now shouted into the air. Devon suddenly felt a surge of power rush through his body! He slammed Nihilia's hand on a rock and the crystal popped into the air! With the reflexes of a cat, Devon grabbed the crystal and in the same movement picked up the rock and smashed the Crimson Crystal into a thousand pieces! The whole area was bathed in red light! Then Devon became aware of screams beginning to fill the air. Scores of souls were finally released. Devon took his bible from his robe and held it to his chest. He then kneeled and began to pray.

"Dear God, please take these souls into your heart. Allow them to enter the gates of paradise. Allow them absolution for their sins. Amen. Devon repeated the prayer many times.

The group that waited at the entrance to the ravine, could see a bright red flash when Devon smashed the crystal.

"I wonder what is happening." Loanna said nervously. "Devon is strong Loanna. I know he will be all right." Ian said with conviction. "Yes Loanna, if anyone can end this evil, it is Devon." Gareth added, putting his arm around Loanna's shoulders.

They watched as the red light subsided. It seemed like an eternity for Loanna, but moments later a soft white light emanated from the sky and lit up the area where the red flash had been seen. They all watched as the light shimmered from white to gold, then back to white again. Finally the light subsided and the ravine was dark again.

As Devon prayed, he could see that a white light was now beginning to bathe the area. All the souls that Nihilia had entrapped were finally free to enter the gates of paradise. The battle was over, but he still did not know what would happen next. As the light subsided, he could see a man and a woman embracing. Devon looked around the area for some sign of Nihilia when a form began to take shape in front of him. He recognized Focura and went to her.

"Focura! Is it truly over?" Devon asked as she fully materialized. "Nihilia is no longer, young one. Your bravery and goodness has overcome impossible odds." She said, then turned to the man and woman who seemed oblivious to them. Devon also looked to them, knowing the man must be Stanton and the woman, Laurie.

"Justin Stanton, you have a decision to make." Focura said, as she walked up to the couple. Stanton looked at Focura and Devon. He felt an unbelievable joy in his heart and could not find his voice. Devon went to him and held out his hand.

"I am Father Devon." He said, as Stanton shook his hand. "I...I am no longer controlled by that monster. I am sorry..." Focura interrupted them and again said, "Justin Stanton, you have a decision to make. You were not killed all those years ago." Devon now understood what decision had to be made...Stanton also knew, "I would want to be with my wife, my Laurie. Will that be possible?" Focura smiled at them and closed her eyes. A soft breeze began and steadily got stronger. Devon watched as Laurie seemed to be falling asleep. As the wind got stronger, Laurie was levitated! A white shaft of light again emanated from the night sky! With the whole area lit up, Devon could see Laurie's cheeks redden and realized that Focura was somehow giving her life! The light faded as did the wind and Laurie floated softly to the ground. Stanton ran to her side and kneeled down. Laurie's eyes fluttered and she suddenly sat up and gasped in the night air.

"I...I had forgotten how sweet the air smelled!" Laurie exclaimed. Justin wrapped his arms around her and looked to Focura, "When you told Nihilia to look to his heart, you were talking to me correct?" "Yes Justin, you have suffered much and I could do no less then allow this reunion." As she finish, a light green glow enveloped Justin and Laurie and they slowly faded and disappeared. "Where have you sent them?" Devon asked. "They did not belong here. They are home. I know of the questions you have young one. I will address the most important one. No one has died here tonight, therefore, you have not killed." "But Focura... " Devon began, but Focura just smiled and faded into the night.

As Devon emerged from the ravine, Loanna was the first one to spot him. As she ran into his open arms, Gareth and Ian also ran up.

"Devon! Is it over!?" Gareth shouted. "As Focura put it, Nihilia is no more!" Devon exclaimed. "But what happened my love?! We saw a bright red light, and minutes later, a gold and white light!" Loanna asked. Devon looked at his wife and friends and smiled, "I will give you all the details on the way to Joycen. But know this, no one died this night."

Devon and Loanna stopped at Cashell to pick up Brittany. Katryn asked Devon if would perform the wedding ceremony. Devon was, of course, honored. This would be the first wedding that Devon would perform since Gareth and Melanie were married.

Shaun began again to learn his lessons in earnest. His father was safe. He also looked forward to seeing his family again in the coming month.

_Focura_ had paid a lot of attention to the humans over the past two years. Artemus however, was the only one who realized it. Though she needed no reason, nor explanation for that matter, it did seem odd. She seemed especially interested in Devon, Loanna and Brittany. It was Focura who told Artemus to allow Igus to teach them how to use the crystals. It was a subject that was constantly on Artemus' mind, and did not go unnoticed.

" _All in good time Artemus, all in good time."_
