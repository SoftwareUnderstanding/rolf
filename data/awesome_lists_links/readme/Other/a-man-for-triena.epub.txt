Prologue

Jethro James swiped irritably at the sticky trail of mingled blood and sweat that was running down his face and dripping into his rust coloured beard. The filthy, bloody state of his uniform sleeve bore witness to how many times he had already gone through this motion. Damn it, the last thing he needed right now was gummed–up eyes.

Sight cleared, he returned to staring intently down the scope of his rifle, trying to get a fix on just how many Taliban he had on his tail. The blood running down his face was the result of the last barrage of shots they had sent his way. The firing had come from behind the rocks to his right, chipping shards of rock into his shallow cave and peppering his head and face with their sharp edges.

The cave wasn't much more than a shallow depression in the ground with the cliff behind him but, he was grateful for any respite at this stage of the operation. An overhang of rock had been providing him with some welcome shade from the merciless sun that burned down on this desolate landscape. Afghanistan mountain country was anything but friendly.

Three days ago he'd led the five man Australian SAS patrol into enemy territory with complete confidence. He'd done it dozens of times in the past, and had always been able to drift through the mountains like a shadow on the land; collecting intelligence as he went. This time their presence had been marked. Now, three of his men were dead, in an ambush so sudden and well planned that betrayal of their mission had to be behind it.

Incursion into Taliban territory always carried a high risk; however, betrayal was an unnecessary added risk, and left a cold knot of fury in his stomach. It would stay there until he found the one responsible or he took it to his grave with him. Obviously, an informant on the base had seen the midnight departure of the patrol and had locked onto the helicopter's bearings. One call and the trap had been sprung.

Three of his men had been cut down by automatic fire thirty minutes into the recon mission. Jethro had knocked the man nearest to him behind an outcrop of rock when the firing started, not in time to save him from a bullet to the thigh but, at least he wasn't cut in half like the other poor devils. Jethro followed him over in a rolling dive and returned deadly fire of his own, holding them off long enough to slap a tourniquet and field dressing on Sam's leg.

For the last three days he'd played cat and mouse with his attackers, constantly moving position but, always heading back towards the pick-up zone with Sam slung over his broad shoulders. Now it looked like the game was nearly over, they had run out of time. Reinforcements had arrived for the Taliban, surrounding them on three sides. It wouldn't be long now before they closed in and finished him off.

Jethro once more squinted down the scope of his rifle, checking on his enemy's movements. A stray beam of sunlight struggled through the late afternoon clouds, bathing the dusty red dirt valley between Jethro's position and his attackers in golden light. Damn, this country was beautiful but, he'd had enough of it. This was supposed to have been his last mission before he rotated home to an instructor's position. Ah well, he'd never thought he was the type to ride a desk anyway, probably would have bored him to death.

A painfully suppressed groan, sounded from nearby. "You make a run for it JJ, I'm done for, but there's no need for you to die with me," grunted Sam as he slowly recovered consciousness, he'd been drifting in and out for the last three hours as he got weaker. Jethro glanced down at the man who had guarded his back on too many occasions to count—no better warrior existed as far as he was concerned.

"Shut up, Sam, we'll get out of this mess as soon as it gets dark enough to move." Jethro answered with grim determination.

"You know the Taliban are only waiting for dark to close in on us J.J. You've picked off enough of their men to make them wary and keep them at bay until now but, I know we've got less than an hour left before they attack in force from all sides. Get going man. Prop me up against the rocks and I'll hold them off while you get away." Sam grunted with pain as he tried to swing his body into a firing position.

Fresh blood welled up from his thigh wound, running down his leg and puddling in the red dirt at his feet. The flies loved this sign of fresh food, swarming in a black cloud to covering his leg in a foul, living bandage.

"Damn it, Sam, hold still. I'm not going anywhere without you so you may as well rest up for the next fight."

Jethro felt a spurt of renewed determination. He didn't know how but, he sure as hell was going to do his best to get them out of this mess. He wanted the informant back at camp to quail in his boots when he saw Jethro had made it back and was gunning for the traitor in camp.

The shadows lengthened as the two warriors settled in to face their final battle, in a red dirt valley, thousands of miles from home.

Chapter 1

Triena Songhelm stared intently at the large viewing screen above the control panel _._

" _Hail Hera_ ," she muttered anxiously under her breath.

The two soldiers in the cave were in serious danger and one of them was the man she had been sent to contact. Her senior team leader, Teril Halidon, was bonded to this man's sister and would not be happy if he was killed before the wedding ceremony.

Teril was a renowned genetic scientist on Teeron and had taken her under his wing after her graduation from the Interplanetary Science Academy. As his assistant she had learned more about human genetics and alien biology than could ever be learned from pure study.

Triena was so grateful for Teril's help with her career that she desperately wanted to succeed with this undertaking, paying him back in some small way. It had seemed so simple and such a good way of showing appreciation when he had asked it of her. But, " _Hail Hera_ ," she sighed loudly in frustration, everything had gone wrong almost as soon as she set course from Australia in the transporter.

First, Jethro James hadn't been on the base when she checked secretly three nights ago; apparently he had just left on this mission and now, after searching the area for two, tension filled days she finds him about to get killed. Some days it just didn't pay to be a galactic traveller from Teeron.

Coming to a decision Triena turned to the other member of the transporter's crew and laid out her rescue plan. Staren Coren was the other member of the crew and one of the toughest fighters in the Guardian Group; she was also extremely beautiful, not that she let that get in the way of her job.

Staren and Triena had served together as Guardians for several years and were firm friends, they had remained thus even after Triena's transfer over to Galactic Science Services. Staren knew how important her studies in genetics with Teril were to Triena, she had studied hard for this opportunity. However, it looked like her training as a Guardian was going to be of more use in the immediate future.

The Guardians were the elite troops who protected the people of Teeron, in the same way as the police force and army did for the people of Earth.

"We'll hover over the men until dark; then I'll quickly drop down on the harness in the tractor beam before the enemy out there can rush them." She looked mildly worried but, not even slightly afraid; this was familiar ground for her. "It's a darn nuisance that this ship becomes visible when the beam is activated but, I'll have to take the chance on being spotted. They won't last much longer without our help."Triena took a deep, calming breath, readying herself for action.

"I'm the official acting guardian on this ship, shouldn't I be the one to go down and make contact?" queried Staren.

"No, this way is the only way. You don't speak fluent English and we need to communicate quickly and quietly in order to extract them safely."

Staren nodded in understanding and agreement.

"I will do my part, Triena you will be extracted as fast as possible."Triena smiled back at her friend before speaking again.

"I know you will perform in your usual excellent manner; now to the details. I'll go down on the tractor beam in the harness, while you stun the enemy soldiers with as much light as possible—that should surprise them and hold them off long enough for me to get the two men into the harness. I'll send them up to you immediately; just return the harness quickly please because the light won't blind the enemy for long.

Thirty tension filled minutes later, darkness fell, suddenly and completely. Stars filled the sky like so many glittering diamonds on black velvet.

Suddenly, light blazed out from several places on the transporter, piercing the night, illuminating the Taliban's positions and blinding everyone in a hundred metre area. Cloaked men scattering in all directions, stunned by the light and eager to scurry away from its betraying glow. Wary faces tried to work out what this new threat meant to the balance of the battle.

Triena landed lightly on the ground directly behind Jethro and Sam, shocking them with her sudden appearance. Jethro swung around pulling his knife smoothly from its scabbard as he prepared to demolish this new enemy. No one would take him easily; the SASR motto was 'Who Dares Wins' and Jethro would dare anything to save his friend.

"Please, come with me immediately if you wish to live." Triena bravely held her arms wide in a gesture of surrender. "I am a friend of your sister Tasha and she sends a message and information for you to consider."

Jethro stopped his attack in mid stride and just stared at the gorgeous six foot tall woman standing so innocently before him. Sapphire blue eyes gazed urgently into his as she spoke softly, her English perfect although, slightly accented.

She wore a silver suit of some kind of close fitting fabric that displayed her luscious curves to very eye catching advantage. Long, gleaming black hair, streamed in soft waves down her slender back, arranged in a low pony-tail.

She studied him calmly, waiting for his decision.

Behind her dangled a harness that she had obviously just unclipped from; its cable running up into the sky towards a lighted hatch. It looked like 'The Powers That Be' had sent a prototype helicopter in to save them. Swinging back to Sam he hoisted him over his shoulder and strode swiftly towards the cable, no sense in wasting a perfectly good rescue by waiting around. Turning back to get Triena's attention he cheerfully barked out an order.

"Let's go honey, those devils won't stay quiet for long, they'll be on our tails soon enough." Giving his rescuer one final, admiring glance he whispered a silent prayer to fate, he seriously hoped that his rescuer was single because, she certainly had his attention. However, survival came first.

Hooking Sam to the harness he looked for the extra clips for his gorgeous saviour and himself. Grabbing Triena by the arm he pulled her close and finding the hook on her utility belt he clipped her onto the line. "Is there another clip for me or will I wait for the next trip?"He casually inquired as if there was no urgency to the matter.

"There are only two clips. I will wait for the harness to return." Triena answered firmly as she made to unclip herself from the line.

"No way, pretty lady, I'll get the next trip, or go with you and Sam now; if the line will take my weight?"

"The cable is strong enough but, there is no way to clip you on. A tractor beam steadies it so that we don't move around, more than two people and we'll start swinging. You'll fall, it's a hundred metres to the hatch—you'll lose your grip." Triena was now frantically trying to dislodge his strong grip on her hands as he stopped her from unclipping.

"No problem, we'll all go together. I guarantee you, if it means getting out of here you'll think I'm welded to that cable, I'm SASR, I can hold on for a few metres, don't sweat it lady."

His determined tone convinced Triena that she was just wasting time; lifting her com-watch to her mouth and speaking fast in a language that Jethro had never heard before; she gave the order to haul them up. " _Hail Hera_ " she hoped that her boss's prospective brother–in-law was as strong as he looked.

It only took Jethro five seconds after his feet touched the deck of the transporter and saw the other crew member to realise that something was not quite as he had thought. His first clue was that they looked amazingly alike, his second was when they conversed rapidly in a language that so far he hadn't heard before but, understood every word of immediately.

He and his sister Tasha had a facility for languages that was, to put it bluntly, a bit spooky. They had always kept quiet about their abilities however. The strange fact was, that after hearing any language spoken for an hour or so, they could understand it completely, also speak it fluently.

Somehow this was totally different. This was an immediate understanding that felt familiar, as if it was his first language not a new, foreign one. It also didn't sound as if they were from anywhere on Earth that he had ever heard of. Weird! But, very, very interesting.

Triena turned towards where Sam lay on the hard deck once more unconscious. With an ease that astonished Jethro, she swung him up into her arms and swiftly carried him towards a large, shiny metal tube and placed him inside.

"Hey, wait up." Jethro reached out to take Sam from her arms.

"Do not worry Jethro James, your friend is safe, I am only placing him in the Oxyzon, it will help him to heal. I am told by other members of your race that it resembles an advanced form of hyperbaric chamber, so you should understand what work it is doing"

Jethro's fierce green eyes searched the calm, beautiful face before him and somehow knew that Sam was safe in her hands.

"Okay, I just need a minute to assimilate what's happening here. Not that I'm not grateful for the rescue---we were in a sticky situation when you suddenly appeared out of the sky." Jethro let the first smile in days cross his face, making even his dirty blood streaked visage look handsome. "I forgot to say "Thanks" in the all the rush to get the hell out of there." His smile widened into a mischievous grin as he leaned forward and gently kissed her forehead. "Thanks again."

He chuckled at her sudden start of surprise. The shock on her face was a bit off-putting but, he thought wryly, he supposed he wasn't looking his best at the moment. His short, dark auburn hair and beard were crusted with red dirt and dried blood. And his clothes stank so badly he could have backed up a skunk.

"Where are we heading now, back to base?"

"No, I cannot take you to your base; you must make your own way there. We will deliver you to a safe area as soon as your friend is healed enough to walk." Jethro immediately went on wary alert at her words. Triena noticed his expression and rushed to reassure him. "First, you and I must speak of your sister Tasha and my mission." Triena waved towards a group of luxurious recliner style seats arranged in a circle in the middle of the room. "Please sit while I explain. But, before I begin, first tell me where your pick-up zone is to be so that Staren can plot a course."

Jethro glanced over at the other woman who was already sitting at a control panel set into the wall below a massive screen, her fingers swiftly tapping over lighted buttons.

He saw his little cave displayed on the screen for a second then, the next minute it was just a distant dot on the landscape, before they accelerated at phenomenal speed towards the horizon. Obviously they hadn't been worried about being seen or they'd have got the hell out of there before now.

"You weren't worried about getting away quickly?" Jethro queried Triena.

"We have a cloaking device that makes us invisible to detection, except for the short time that the hatch is open and the tractor beam breaks the contact. Obviously we move as quickly as possible then," answered Triena.

Jethro looked intrigued by her answer and then let his gaze drift intently around the room; it was too large to call it a cabin. His gaze settled with intense interest on the oxyzon and several other unusual objects.

" _I get the feeling we're not in Kansas anymore Toto," he muttered softly to himself_ , before continuing out loud in a more serious tone. "What has Tasha got to do with this set-up of yours lady? Come to think of it, I don't even know your name never mind where all this help has come from?" He queried Triena with a raised eyebrow.

"My name is Triena Songhelm but, that is not important. The important information I have for you is that your sister is bonded to my employer who is a genetic scientist from Teeron." He and your sister asked me to contact you and make sure you made it back safely to Australia for the wedding ceremony." Taking a deep breath Triena finished her message, as so far Jethro hadn't run screaming for the escape hatch. "Teril Halidon also asks for your help in buying a special gift for her as is the tradition in your Earth courting ritual."

Jethro sank deeper into the generously upholstered seat, shock keeping him silent. What the hell did all of this mean, was he delirious and actually still in the mountain cave? Was this all in his imagination?

Biting his lip until he drew blood he was soon assured of his conscious state by the pain that action evoked. _Damn!_ It appeared that the aliens had landed and he had a new threat to handle. Realising that he had been too complacent about their situation he sprang to his feet, finally deciding the time had come to get pro-active. Striding over to the oxyzon he peered down through a glass panel at a quietly sleeping Sam and tried to work out how to get him out. He seemed fine, and had good healthy colour in his face for the first time in three days, Jethro noted in relief but, he needed to get him the hell away from here.

"I don't get the courting ritual bit or the bonded story, least of all do I get this vessel or you." Jethro spat out as he turned, pining Triena to her seat with a fierce gaze as, he gave up on working the controls of the oxyzon. _Hell, where was a good hammer when you needed one._ He thought.

Triena realised that the situation was getting awkward; Jethro wasn't a man who liked to feel powerless or confused. She quickly decided that plain talk was the answer, he needed information and she had no doubt that he could handle the truth, after all, he was Tasha's brother as well as SASR trained.

"I'll explain everything if you will just take a seat and calm down. First, please be assured of your safety and that of your friend. I only wish to deliver my message and enlist your help with the buying of your sister's gift. If you need more reassurance just listen to this recording." Triena tapped her com-watch and waited with curiosity for Jethro's reaction.

Three voices echoed into the room coming from hidden speakers, speaking a language that was previously unheard of to Jethro. It appeared to be a recording of all the conversations that had taken part since Jethro had come on board. Nothing strange about that except that added to the two women's voices was one male voice, Jethro's, and he was casually speaking the same language. Not English in response to Triena's English, as he had thought he was doing. Shock kept him immobile and silent.

"You see, you and your sister are one of us; descendents of an honoured Teeron who bonded and took as a life-mate your Earth ancestor, nearly one hundred years ago. Our scientists only found out about your existence a short time ago and are now seeking out all descendents of that bonding. We wish to offer you help in understanding your special abilities."

Triena gave him a knowing look as she continued her story. "Apparently the mixing of the races has produced some----" Triena paused, biting her lip as she searched for the right words. "Anomalies, shall we say. Your sister's and your ability, to instantly understand any foreign language is one such anomaly, there are others." She hinted at mysteriously, before continuing. "That is one of the messages I was asked to deliver."

Triena rose from her seat and quietly joined Staren at the control panel, leaving a stunned Jethro in peace to absorb the situation. Sam needed time to heal and they were all safe for the moment. Triena felt satisfaction that she had completed the first part of her mission. " _Hail Hera_ " that she could complete the rest without letting Teril down.

Chapter 2

Two hours later Triena looked over at Jethro's still form, slumped casually in his seat as he slept soundly. He hadn't said a word since listening to the recording, just frowned in concentration then, sat back and closed his eyes. Seconds later he had been calmly sleeping and still appeared to be in that state.

Triena's own apparent calm was not so genuine; she was still in a state of shock at finding her own life-mate was here in the transporter with her.

It was now common knowledge that Teeronites were finding their life-mates amongst Earthlings but, it was still a shock to realise that she was one of them. At thirty years of age, with two exacting careers under her belt, she had been sure that she was one of the Teeronites who would never bond.

She had been sure that science was going to be her life-mate right up until the moment Jethro had casually kissed her forehead. Then, the tingle that signalled her life-mate was near at hand had started in her fingers and quickly spread its warmth up her arm, across her chest and into her heart. " _Hail Hera_ " her love was a sweaty, blood soaked Earthling warrior who was suspicious and didn't appear overly interested in her, judging by his sleeping form.

He was also brave; loyal and more magnificent than any man she had ever met on Teeron. No way would he ever want an alien life-mate, if his reaction so far was any indication. Some days it just didn't pay to go to work, she thought miserably.

Teeronite bonding rituals were simple and straightforward. At some point in time you met your life-mate and were instantly drawn to hold hands. A tingle then started in both partner's hands and simultaneously travelled up their arms. By the time the warmth had spread across their chests and into their hearts they were fathoms deep in love and bonded until death and probably beyond

No Teeronite would take a life-mate without this sign. The ones who had risked a 'friendly' mating had lived miserable lives that were much worse than being alone. Now, Triena had to try and convince this fierce warrior that she was the woman for him, or spend the rest of her life feeling cut in half.

Triena drew strength from the fact that the Earthling, Teeronite bondings, so far had only been one-sided for a short while. The Teeronite felt the instant bond as usual but, it appeared to take the Earthling a little longer to fall in love. Also some courting rituals seemed to be necessary if Teril was to be believed. She had no idea where she was going to find the time for courting, however, she hadn't spent years as a guardian not to have learnt how to think on her feet. " _Hail Hera"_ love was complicated.

Pushing aside her personal problems Triena signalled to Staren to help her remove Sam from the oxyzon, he would be nearly healed by now and she needed time to wipe his memory of all things Teeron.

Suddenly the supposedly sleeping Jethro was between them and hauling Sam into his own arms.

"I'll take him now if you don't mind." he grunted as he hauled Sam protectively close.

Triena signalled for Staren to release their patient then spoke quietly to Jethro.

"Sam will wake in five minutes and will be nearly healed and able to walk. However Staren must run one more program with him." Taking a deep breath she prepared to face down Sam's fierce protector. "We must hypnotise him so that he retains no memory of this ship or our involvement in your rescue. My mission is to keep you safe and make sure you attend the wedding of your sister; no one else is to know we exist."

Triena turned pleading eyes on him. We don't want the people of Earth to panic or misconstrue our intentions when we visit your planet. We only visit to gather science, not to interfere in your world in any way." Triena waited calmly for his response.

Jethro searched her face looking for any deception. Finding only honest goodwill there he gave a brief, sharp nod of his head in agreement.

"Okay, there's no way he would understand any of this anyway. It might be best if he doesn't have to try and deal with aliens as well as his injury. And if he ever finds out that I'm one too it will really freak him out." Jethro finished on a wry chuckle. "I'm not sure I can deal with being part alien myself."

"Take heart Jethro James, we are all human, only separated by thousands of years and different planets. No one knows how we were separated. However, our scientists believe it was by either space travel or some kind of natural disaster on an, as yet unknown, third planet. Our scientists have been working for hundreds of years trying to find where we all originated from." Triena smiled gently into his worried face.

Jethro swayed on his feet as the impact of her smile raced through his body and jerked all his male hormones to attention. He was going to need some time with the gorgeous Triena, to see just how human they both were. He would make it a priority to uphold the regiment motto of "Who Dares Wins," by daring to make time with this alien once he had Sam nice and safe, and back at camp. Oh yes, Miss Alien Transporter Captain had better look out, because, Jethro James was going to be stalking her fine figure just as soon as possible. Now that he'd had time to absorb everything that Triena had told him he was feeling remarkably cheerful and optimistic about his future.

Jethro's musings were interrupted by Staren's approach holding an electronic device that resembled an ereader in size and shape. Jethro placed Sam in one of the seats as the lights were dimmed in the room and he was gently shaken awake by Staren as she held the device in front of his face. Speaking into a microphone attached to her shirt her Teeronal was mechanically translated into English as she spoke to Sam and encouraged him to stare at the screen of the device.

"You have been injured and delirious but, will shortly be well enough to walk. You were carried to this area by your friend Jethro who escaped the Taliban as dark fell, you were very fortunate, luck was with you. You will not remember anything of this vessel or of me." Staren repeated the words over and over until she was satisfied that Sam would have no memory of his rescue.

Clicking her fingers she signalled him to sleep again. Sam slumped in his seat seeming relaxed and comfortable so Jethro was able to relax. There was no fresh bleeding, nor did he appear to be in any pain. So far so good, with Sam's condition at least.

Turning to Triena he gave her the co-ordinates of the pick-up zone who then repeated them to Staren. He was finally convinced she was telling the truth, unbelievable as it was. With an almost imperceptible vibration, they were once again flying at incredible speed.

"I haven't thanked you properly for saving us and giving medical aid to Sam; it was very ungracious of me. My only excuse is that I've been a bit busy the last few days however, that's no excuse for bad manners."

Jethro tried for a charming smile; he had a lot of ground to make up with his alien beauty. The effort was spoilt somewhat, by his crusted, bloody beard and filthy clothes but, he figured things could only improve from here on in, surely he would have another chance in the future to present a better figure. After all, he apparently had his sister to vouch for him and her brand new fiancée. Curiosity finally surfaced in Jethro's mind.

"What's the man like that my sister has got herself engaged too?"

Triena grinned. "You will like him. He adores your sister and would do anything for her. He is the geneticist in charge of finding the mixed race descendents, the most highly qualified scientist on Teeron. He found Tasha and followed her from Russia right across Europe, trying to protect her and win her love.

Tasha told me she was already madly in love with him however; she let him convince her with a wonderfully romantic proposal." Triena's twinkling eyes drew a happy response from Jethro.

His bellowing laugh and flashing white teeth displayed his heartfelt good humour. "That's my Tasha alright, never let a good opportunity pass her by."

Jethro's relaxed mood was shattered in the next moment as, Staren spoke getting their attention.

"We are one mile from your pick-up co-ordinates sir. It is time for you to hook up and prepare to drop. I will awaken Sam and hook him on."

Before Jethro could move Staren had hoisted Sam into her arms and walked swiftly towards the hatch. Jethro was bemused by the ease with which these slim beauties could sling huge men around as if they weighed no more than a bag of potatoes. Sam equalled his own six feet five inches and not inconsiderable muscle mass.

"How in hell do you ladies handle six foot plus men so easily?"

Triena answered with a casual shrug.

"Teeronites are stronger, healthier and able to run faster than an average Earthling. We assume it is because we have no pollution and are vegetarians that our health is so good. Also, Staren and I are trained Guardians.

"Okay, I'll bite, what's a guardian? Jethro was now consumed by curiosity and damned himself to hell for wasting time sleeping when he should have been finding out all he could of this woman; a woman who drew him like no other ever had."

"A Guardian is a trained enforcer, a cross between your policeman and a specialist soldier. We are only one race of a few million people, on a planet the size of Earth. We have never had a war or serious civil disturbance so we have no need of an army. Guardians are only needed for the protection of our interplanetary scientists and home based civil crimes."

Triena thought now might be a good time to fill him in on a few more Teeron facts so taking a deep breath she continued. "Unfortunately, the down side, as you say, is that being only one race we tend to all look alike. We all have black hair and blue eyes. We are also, all well over six feet tall, including most of our women." Triena's eyes twinkled briefly as she continued. "We've all been very excited by the different hair and eye colours that the recent bondings have introduced to our gene pool. Wait until you see Dan and Calli's twins," she finished.

Jethro shook his head in bemusement, trying to take it all in. "Obviously we've been in expert hands, thank you for all your help, especially Sam's medical aid."

Leaning forward Jethro surprised Triena with another of his soft butterfly kisses, this time on the tip of her nose. "See you soon I hope." With that said he bounded out of his seat and was hooking himself onto the harness before Triena had time to recover her composure.

A bemused Triena quietly went to the control panel, still stunned by the effects of Jethro's casual kiss, while Staren woke Sam and opened the hatch.

"Be quick now please," whispered Staren into the now listening night. "We risk being seen now that the hatch is open."

Just as the two men started to descend Sam snapped his head up and with a forceful look into Staren's astonished face whispered back.

"Gorgeous, if you think I would ever forget you then you're seriously mistaken. I'll find you again and then we'll discuss my memory problems, including how I feel about you. Until then your secret is safe with me."

Jethro struggled to smother his laugh but, failed miserably to cover his grin. Sam was nothing if not smart, the fox had been bluffing all along. It looked like another Teeronite was going to be stalked by an Earthling. The last sight Staren had of Sam was his grinning smile and a fierce look of determination in his gleaming eyes.

Triena was dealing with her own problems as she gazed into Jethro's wonderful face on the screen above the controls she was monitoring. She wondered how long it would be before she saw him again. " _Hail Hera._ " Please keep him safe until then.

Chapter 3

Jethro's eyes tracked the progress of the harness up towards the hatch; taking in the shape of the, so far, unseen transporter. It bore a strong resemblance to a very large stealth bomber in shape. The minute the hatch closed the plane vanished and once again the night appeared empty. Jethro felt a faint vibration disturb the night air but, other than that, they would have thought themselves totally alone. Boy! What the SASR could do with one of those beauties.

Slipping his compass from a pocket in his camo pants Jethro took a quick check of their bearings then, dragging Sam's arm over his strong shoulders, set off towards the meeting point.

"You don't need to help me walk J.J. whatever they did to me in that machine has my leg feeling nearly a hundred percent." Sam pulled his arm back off Jethro's shoulders and with only a slight limp trekked alongside his friend. "But, you can fill in the time by telling me what the hell the situation is with our two gorgeous saviours." He chuckled dryly then added, "I somehow think that no matter how beautiful they are that they're not angels."

Jethro frowned, immediately wary. He trusted Sam like a brother but, he had to protect Tasha in case the situation blew up in their faces.

"For the moment it would be advisable to pretend that none of this happened. I promise I'll fill you in as soon as we get back home to Australia. Let's just go with the scenario that I helped you walk away from the ambush and let the rest go for now. I know it's asking a lot but, I have good reasons for keeping it quiet."

Sam gave the situation a few seconds consideration before answering Jethro in a calm, serious voice.

"I'm too glad to be alive to argue the point but, I do want your promise to help me track down Staren again—that lady is special, and I get the feeling she just might be my future." Sam spoke without a trace of doubt. Jethro was stunned by the conviction in Sam's voice. Where had this acceptance by Sam of the unknown come from? Even he, the part alien, was struggling with the news.

"You've got my word on it." said Jethro, as he accompanied his words with a friendly slap on Sam's shoulder and a soft chuckle. "Sam, The Man, has finally fallen eh?"

The two men moved quietly through the night in companionable silence for the next ten minutes until Jethro couldn't resist asking the question that had been bugging him since they landed.

"Tell me, how did you resist the hypnotic program that Staren ran on you? She seemed pretty confident that it would work."

"No one has ever been able to put me under." Sam laughed at Jethro's confusion. "I have some sort of inbuilt resistance to suggestion, just contrariness I guess." Sam's smile faded as he continued speaking. "I don't know what's going on but, you sure as hell seemed to understand so, I'll go along with you for now."

Jethro was warmed by Sam's faith in him.

"I promise you won't be sorry, I'll make sure you don't get killed." He laughed as he hugged Sam's shoulders with one arm as he placed a light, playful a punch on his chest.

That was the end of all conversation for the next thirty minutes as they swiftly covered the distance necessary in amiable, silent companionship. Two hours later a rescue helicopter picked them up and whisked the two men back to camp and a worried commander.

The meeting with Commander Wallis was fraught with sadness at the loss of their men and bitterness at the traitor in camp. Jethro handed over the dead men's tags with apologies for not being able to bring back their bodies. Commander Wallis shook his head sadly in acceptance at what had to be. "Don't blame yourself, you got Sam back and that's all I can ask of you. Now my priority must be to find the traitor in camp before I lose anymore men. Tell me exactly what you remember of your departure, I need all the intel I can gather at this point."

The three men huddled over the commander's desk checking maps and personnel records before swiftly putting a plan together. With Jethro and Sam chomping at the bit to even the score, it didn't take long to work out a viable plan of action. They badly wanted the traitor who had been responsible for the death of the rest of their squad.

Commander Wallis went over the plan one final time so that nothing was left to chance; they would only have this one chance to flush out the informer.

"I'll arrange a fall out of all personnel on the parade grounds, including the attached Afghan forces, tomorrow morning. Our losses will be announced and that Jethro will recognise the informer by sight." Wallis waited for Jethro's nod of understanding before continuing.

"He'll inspect the troops slowly, at my command, my bet is that the guilty man will be shocked to see you two alive and will make a break for it. We'll have him before you fly out the next day."

Straightening wearily Commander Wallis offered his hand to Jethro and Sam. "It's a sad day for the regiment but, I thank God that you two returned safe. Well done men. Now you two need to rest and keep under cover for the next few hours, we mustn't lose the advantage of surprise. "

The next morning Jethro wasn't the least bit surprised when the Commanders plan worked perfectly. He slowly walked down the ranks studying each face carefully, finally, coming to two Afghan soldiers, he stood stony faced and unmoving in front of them watching the sweat run freely down their terrified faces. It only took seconds for them to cut and run for the gate. They stood no chance. However, gratifyingly, it was their own men who brought them down. It then took the might of half a dozen SASR soldiers to drag them away from their compatriots, to the comparative safety of a prison cell.

Jethro felt satisfaction settle in his soul, he'd got some kind of justice for his men now. Nothing would bring them back, however at least their deaths had uncovered the traitors in camp and probably saved the loss of many more lives.

Chapter 4

Jethro and Sam arrived back at home base in Perth Australia two days later and immediately put in for two months leave. Jethro needed to get back to Tasha in Queensland as soon as possible, and Sam wasn't letting him go anywhere without him until he helped him to find Staren. Both men were glad to be out of the firing line for the time being.

"You think we might be getting a bit too old for this lark J.J.? Maybe we should consider retiring into civilian life," queried a half serious Sam.

"Maybe, but I think I'll give the instructor route a go before I call it quits," answered an unworried Jethro. He had more to worry about than his career at this point in time. He needed to see Tasha, and soon. With an inward, depreciatory chuckle, he wondered what the chances of him turning green in the near future were.

The two men had unpacked their kit as soon as they had arrived on base and were now re-packing for the flight to Queensland's Gold Coast. It would be no problem to score a flight with a troop carrier heading out for Amberly Air Base in Queensland, from there it was only a little over an hour's drive to the Gold Coast. Someone on the base was sure to be heading in that direction for a week of R and R and give them a lift. Slinging their backpacks over one shoulder the two warriors headed out the door, aiming for the car pool and a lift to the airfield.

The six hour flight from Perth in the slow, noisy troop carrier had left Jethro weary and not the least bit cranky. He really hated the noisy planes; they were alternately freezing or blistering hot and only tolerable if you jammed earplugs half way down your ear canal. It beat walking but, not by much. Sam however, was his usual cheerful, joking self and Jethro was seriously considering choking him into silence if he didn't shut up.

"Come on J.J., cheer up," Sam heckled him. "We're here now so stop complaining. You whinged that much I worried that the flight crew was going to try and stuff you into the only head on board," Sam reminisced happily. "That of course would have been down- right entertaining as I would have been forced to defend you. I don't think we would have ever got another lift if it had come down to that pleasant little set-to."

Jethro finally shook off his bad mood as he visualised that scenario. "Now that would have been one entertaining way to break the boredom," throwing his head back he bellowed out a happy laugh as, he continued walking to the exit. "

They had just cleared the hanger area and were looking for a lift to the base carpool when Jethro felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise. A strong feeling of being signalled had him turning away from the vehicles and heading around to the back of the hanger.

Half way down the road he spotted a tall figure in a jump suit, leaning over a jeep, with its head under the bonnet. He knew he would recognise that shape anywhere in the world, even under a burqa. That was no ordinary airman, that was Triena or he was a blind man. It looked like they wouldn't need a lift after all.

"That's a neat trick the way you got my attention Triena," Jethro called out softly as he got closer to her. Triena moved gracefully out from under the engine bay and turned towards him, smiling in welcome as she slammed down the hood of the jeep.

Pulling a slim metal tool from her pocket, she held it up for him to see, it was pencil shaped and seemed innocuous enough. However, with a flick of her finger the device started to hum and the hair all over his body started to prickle.

"Hey, cut that out," Jethro grumbled as he got the urge to scratch every inch of his body, Triena laughed and with another flick of her finger turned it off.

"When I was on guardian duty these gadgets proved useful for distracting wild animals or for silently signalling our team members. You responded well, even without training. More proof of your heritage it seems." Triena looked behind Jethro and spotted Sam's silent approach. "You two seem to like each-others company?" she questioned him with an unhappy look.

"Sam is determined to see Staren again—he seems to think she's his destiny, so I'm not allowed to move without him until he has the correct introduction," Jethro grinned at her shocked look. "Don't blame me, he thought it up all by himself, I'm as surprised as you are."

"Triena grew very thoughtful at his words and came to an immediate decision. "He is welcome to accompany us. I have a feeling that Teril will be very interested in his reaction,"

Closing the bonnet she waved Sam forward and gestured for them both to get into the jeep. "The transporter is close by. You must meet with Teril before I take you to your sister, he's very eager to meet you and enlist your help. Anything that affects Tasha is his number one priority these days," she laughed softly. "The man is crazy in love with her."

Jethro immediately sobered at her words. His sister was all he had left in the way of family, their parents having died in a car accident several years earlier and there being no other extended family. This Teril had better be making her happy or an SASR was about to come down hard on his alien head.

"Let's hustle then, I can't wait to meet this paragon of virtue. I just hope he knows I'll seriously hurt him if he upsets Tasha."

"You have no need to worry about Teril's commitment. He will take excellent care of your sister. I have known the man for several years and he has always held to the highest of standards." As she finished speaking, Triena stopped the jeep at the far end of an old, crumbling runway.

Signalling Jethro and Sam to accompany her she headed towards what looked like a vacant parking lot. Soundlessly a set of steps appeared in the air in front of them, unfolding smoothly until they hit the tarmac. Triena didn't pause in her stride, just ascended the steps effortlessly and vanished inside. Jethro quickly followed with Sam hard on his heels.

Being fully conscious this time around Sam took a few seconds to absorb his surrounding, before quickly scanning the room looking for Staren.

"Hey, love of my life, where are you?" Sam bellowed out into the vast space. "I need you to give me the conducted tour." Staren appeared silently through a sliding door in the wall and immediately went to Sam, smiling and placing her hand in his. Seconds ticked by as some kind of silent communication seemed to take place between them as they stared calmly into each other's eyes. Like a lock clicking, they both dropped their hands at the same time and smiled a look of love and acceptance at each other.

"It is done." spoke Staren in a soft shy voice. "We are bonded and will be life-mates from now until death."

Jethro stood perfectly still, amazement fogging his mind, not so much at the small ceremony but, that it would be Sam who experienced it. _Wasn't he supposed to be the part alien who spoke the language and understood the situation?_

Triena moved forward to hug Staren and congratulate her. The two women happily conversing while Sam just stood beaming not understanding a word of what was being said.

Jethro listened to the women for a minute and then reached out to shake Sam's hand. "Congratulations mate, it appears that you just got engaged, or bonded as they call it," he looked intently into Sam's eyes looking for any confusion. "Are you sure this is what you want?"

"Oh yeah, Staren's the woman for me. I knew it the minute I saw her," Sam replied happily. "I suppose I'll have to learn the language but, that doesn't seem to be half as important as the fact that she feels the same way about me." He turned to Staren placing his arm gently across her back and drawing her close for a brief hug.

Triena reluctantly brought the happy reunion to a close with her next words. "We must be on our way now. Teril is waiting for Jethro and we have much to accomplish today." Turning swiftly to the control panel she gestured the men to take seats, instructing them to fasten their seat belts. "The belts are an extra precaution as the seats already have inbuilt magnetisation that holds your body down. Still, we like to take extra care."

Several minutes passed in contemplative silence before Jethro thought to ask where they were going. Triena's answer stunned him anew.

"For as long as we have been visiting Earth we have always tethered the Pods in the Hinterland behind the Gold Coast. There are vast areas of unpopulated bush there, perfect for tethering a pod as large as a city from discovery. Ours is actually called The Interplanetary Research Pod 6."

Triena's voice changed to a lecturing tone as she continued on with her narrative. "We have ten pods that travel the galaxies doing research work as well as trying to find the origins of the human species. Each pod can carry up to eight transporters, although the usual is six, unless it's a very hostile planet. The transporters are used to take the teams to different points on the planet for their individual research specialties. Most areas on Earth can be reached in two hours this way.

"Bloody Hell," grumbled Jethro. "The least you could have done is saved me that bloody awful flight from Perth to here" Triena laughed at the disgusted look on his face. "We are not meant to interfere in any way that would draw attention to us. If you had vanished in Perth and then turned up an hour later on the Gold Coast it would have been impossible to explain away. This way you are now free to go off the grid without questions being asked."

"Damn it, you didn't have to sit in that bloody noisy troop carrier or you wouldn't be so blasé. I'll probably be deaf for days." He complained.

The rest of the group laughed at his disgusted expression. As he had spoken in English Sam understood and gave the rowdiest laugh of all, then filled the others in on Jethro's complaining during the trip home.

"Thank God he slept through most of the flight back from Afghanistan or you would probably be fishing him out of the ocean about now." More laughter filled the room, before a comfortable silence descended on the flight deck for the rest of the trip.

A short time later the large viewing screen showed that they were hovering over a huge, bush covered valley deep in the Gold Coast Hinterland. Triena and Staren sat comfortably relaxed in their seats at the control panels, their fingers flying over the buttons and keys.

With a slight jerk, the transporter glided sideways into apparent emptiness for several seconds. Suddenly, a cavernous tunnel appeared out of nowhere in the clear blue sky and they were sucked smoothly into its hidden depths.

Bright lights shone from every part of the metal interior, lighting up an unbelievably large space. It looked like a city lit by an artificial sun. Finally, after endless minutes, their transporter stopped in a huge polished metal hanger, next to another vessel like theirs. The viewing screen went dark, cutting them off once more from the world outside the flight deck.

"Yep, we aren't in Kansas anymore, that's for sure." Sam heard Jethro's muttered comment and finally showed some interest in more than Staren,

"Ah, J.J., you wouldn't have any idea of where we are would you? not that I'm worried, mind you but, I would like to know if I'm going to have to fight an army to get Staren away from here." He whispered close to Jethro's ear.

"Don't worry. Staren wants you so I don't think you'll have to fight anyone, however, I think you better get used to the idea that these people aren't from around here. You better face the fact that you just got engaged to an alien," Jethro replied, worried about Sam's reaction.

Sam looked thoughtful rather than alarmed.

"Oh well, I always did like exotic women, I can handle it," he grinned happily.

"Don't sweat it Sam, apparently we're all part of the human race, so, no green kids." Jethro doubled over laughing at the staggered look that passed over Sam's face. "Come on, let's move, the ladies appear to have shut down our ride, time to meet my future brother-in-law." At Sam's questioning look he just shrugged. "I'll fill you in, just as soon as I know what the situation is myself."

Finding the magnetised seat was no longer holding him down he stood, stretching, then moved towards Triena. Time to assess this whole damn situation, part alien or not, if it came to it, he would defend Earth with his last breath.

Chapter 5

It took nearly as long to make their way through the massive pod by lifts and travelators, to get to the command centre, as the whole trip from Amberly Base to here. The pod was an unbelievable size. Men and women smiled at them as they passed, greeting them all happily as if they were one big family. Jethro hoped they were friendly, because Earth had nothing that could go up against this mammoth.

Finally, a door slid open in front of Jethro and he immediately knew he had found Teril. Arms outstretched, a massive, black haired, handsome man rushed at him and lifted him off his feet in a bear hug. His smile was huge and very obviously genuine.

"Welcome brother, to our home away from home. Tasha will be relieved that you are safe, as are we all." He rushed to add. Switching to accented, broken English, Teril included Sam in the welcome. "I congratulate you and Staren. We welcome you to our team, everyone very happy."

Teril turned to Triena and questioned her rapidly with an intense look of concentration and excitement. Jethro kept up with most of the conversation but, some of it was highly technical and beyond his grasp of Teeronal. However, he worked out enough to know that Sam was needed for some kind of experiment. Alarm bells went off once more in his head _. Damn it!_ _Wasn't anything straightforward anymore?"_ He wouldn't let his friend be treated like a guinea pig by these people, even if they were related. Getting in close to Teril he delivered a warning

"Hey, Teril, I didn't follow all of that but, if you think you're running experiments on Sam you'll have me to deal with first." Jethro squared his shoulders, clenching and unclenching his fists, readying for the fight of his life. Triena pushed between the two men reverting to her old job as guardian instantly. She loved Jethro but, Teril's safety was always going to be her duty. Placing a staying hand on Jethro's chest she pushed him back. Then, speaking swiftly to him she raced to avert disaster.

"Please calm down. We only want a DNA swab from Sam's mouth. His instant recognition of Staren as his life-mate has only been known to happen amongst Teeronites, so, obviously given our mission to trace Teeron descendents on Earth we are excited by this occurrence." Easing back a little, Triena watched Jethro's face anxiously for his next move. "There is a good chance that your friend Sam is also one of us." Triena waited warily for Jethro's reaction.

Jethro wondered just how much more he would be able to take in before his brain shut down from overload. Now, not only did he have to accept that he and Tasha were part alien it looked like his best friend might be one too. He started to laugh and couldn't stop. Doubling over in mirth he grabbed onto Sam's arm, dragging him close and eyes sparkling into his friend's confused ones, he spluttered out a warning.

"You better watch out Sam, it seems there's a better than even chance that you and I are related. Thank God you and Tasha were never attracted to each other." Sam just shrugged his shoulders good- naturedly.

"Sounds good to me, beats being a foster kid. What do we have to do to find out for sure?"

Teril joined back in the conversation at this point, speaking directly to Sam. "We must a swab of your saliva take, also possibly a little blood. DNA will then confirm in short time and we will know for sure."

Teril was struggling with his English so he asked Triena to take charge of Sam and the tests while he had a private talk with Jethro.

"Please will you come with me to my quarters, I want to ask your advice regarding Tasha's special wedding gift."

Walking to the edge of the room ahead of Jethro, Teril pressed the part of the wall that opened a sliding door and waving Jethro ahead of him, followed him inside. Turning serious eyes on Jethro, he asked him to take a seat as he offered him a drink.

"Please, sit and rest while I bring you up to date with my bonding to your sister."

Teril spent the next twenty minutes entertaining Jethro with his trek across Europe in his sister's wake and the final proposal at the top of the Eiffel Tower. Jethro was impressed by Teril's ingenuity in arranging the carriage ride and the luxury dinner. He figured he'd better stay on his good side in case he needed a few ideas when his time came to propose. He no longer had any doubts that Triena was going to be in his future.

Teril finally brought up the favour he needed. "I want to buy Tasha a surprise wedding gift that is special to her." He turned a serious, no longer casual face towards Jethro.

"Tasha has told me of her love of horses and the Arabian Stud that you were both raised on until the death of your parents. I want to replicate that home for her on Teeron, if at all possible."

Jethro felt his jaw drop in shock. "How in hell do you expect me to shift a whole house to another planet, not to mention at least twenty horses?

"Please don't panic—I have a plan. The original plans of the house have been researched by my team and now, with your input, the details and changes can be factored in. A group of very good Earthling builders, who live and work on Teeron, will build an exact copy."

Teril turned a face full of satisfaction towards his new brother.

"I have already purchased the land so building will commence as soon as you give me the design changes that your family made." Teril smiled eagerly at his own ingenuity, but quickly adding. "However, we must keep it a secret from Tasha until the wedding."

Jethro grew thoughtful as he realised that Teril was deadly serious—their old, well loved home was going to be resurrected on another planet. He felt overwhelming happiness fill his soul, strangling his voice with emotion, so that he could only mutter in reply.

"That sounds great Teril, we haven't been back to see the old place since it was sold—too painful for us. However, a replica will thrill Tasha."

"We will only be able to spend part of the year in the home for the next few years as my work here on Earth is vitally important to both our planet's well being." However, other teams will gradually take over and we will eventually be able to settle down in Tasha dream home to raise our children." Teril looked totally satisfied at that thought.

"That accounts for the home but, how do you plan to move horses to Teeron?" Jethro was starting to get into this project himself now that the idea had sunk in. "You'll need to carry tons of feed for them. Horses can't have their feed changed suddenly or they're likely to get colic."

"I have checked with my superiors and they are inclined to indulge me as I've achieved some dramatic results to date with tracing the descendents.

"The animals will return home with us in this Pod when we leave; a large part of one deck will be cleared just for them and all their needs." His smile sobered as he continued to outline his plan to give Tasha back the home she had lost. "I would appreciate your buying me five mares that are either in foal to, or can be inseminated with, the bloodlines of your old stallions."

Jethro was getting seriously interested now. He wondered what the chances of buying close to Tasha and Teril were.

"I'll be happy to help out but, you'll need to give me a budget before I can promise to acquire that much prime bloodstock. Arabs aren't cheap you know and we had some of the best." He sighed sadly. "It broke our hearts to sell up but, Tasha couldn't run the place by herself and I was already contracted to the army and serving overseas. Bills had to be paid and Tasha had to finish her education."

Teril smiled in understanding. "I understand your feelings and the problems you both faced however, with your help, I can and will give you both back a semblance of your old home. I have earned a very good salary for many years so money is not a problem. Also, land is very cheap on Teeron." Teril grinned happily. "We have a lot of it to spare you see."

"Is there any chance that I'd be welcome to buy close to you both? I think a home base is going to be figuring in my near future somehow" Jethro ran his hands through his hair in bewilderment at his thoughts, before continuing. "I might as well tell you straight up that, I'm seriously interested in Triena. I don't know how or why but, I'm pretty sure that she's the one for me.

Jethro held his breath as he waited for Teril's reaction to this bit of news. It wasn't long in coming as Teril doubled over laughing as he reached over to slap Jethro heartily on his back in obvious pleasure.

"My last gift to Tasha has come true. She will be deliriously happy when she finds out that her much loved brother is to be our neighbour. We must make plans immediately to buy the land next to ours." Teril was oblivious to Jethro's panicked look as he started tapping out commands on a nearby keyboard.

"Hey! Hold on Teril, I don't even know if I can afford the land. Sure I've been earning $100,000 a year for the last few years and I haven't spent much of it, but I don't know if I've got enough; added to that I've hardly spoken to Triena, never mind checked to see if she's available and interested in me."

Teril waved his worries away with a casual hand. "Triena is not bonded so I'm sure that if your feelings are strong then she must reciprocate them. As to the land, it is only a fraction of what you pay here. Remember I told you that we have a small population and plenty of land, you will be able to afford it."

Teril tapped a button on his fancy keyboard and immediately a screen appeared on the wall of the room, he signalled Jethro to look at it, "Watch this and you will be convinced."

Jethro watched as a video played, showing a peaceful green landscape, with rolling hills that sloped gently down to a perfect golden, sand beach. White tipped waves gently kissed the sand and then retreated to join the rest of the blue, blue ocean. Jethro saw what looked like two suns blazing in a clear, cloudless sky.

"That is the valley where we have chosen to live. It is only the next cove over from the rest of our friends of mixed Earth and Teeron marriages. You need never to feel cut off from your Earth heritage living here. Half of this valley is ours and the rest will be yours if I press this key." Teril held a tantalising finger over the keyboard as he gazed intently into Jethro's eyes.

"Just how much money do I need to be your next door neighbour?" Jethro asked, intense desire coating his voice. Teril shocked Jethro by naming an amount that seemed little more than the cost of a car here on Earth. Eyes pinned to the screen as it once again wandered tantalisingly over the lush valley he gave the go ahead. "Buy, damn it. And if I have to live in a tent while I build the house myself, then that's what I'll do."

Teril pressed the key, whooping with excitement. "Your sister is going to love me all over again for this few minutes of work." Teril busily copied data to a disk not noticing his future brother-in-law's worried frown.

Jethro didn't know just where all of his careful restraint had vanished to. Five minutes with this man who was a virtual stranger to him and he'd lost all caution. Teril interrupted his musing by dropping his next bombshell.

"I will contact our builder and let him know that we will need two homes building now. You can decide the details after you are bonded to Triena, I'm sure she will have many ideas. Luckily she and Tasha are good friends so we will all be happy." Teril rubbed his hands together, happy and eager to get to the next part of his plans.

"Hey, slow down. I don't know if I can afford to build a house either."

"You can." Teril tapped a key and Jethro's whole financial situation appeared on the screen. A program running alongside it listed all the land and building costs.

"Damn it, how did you get that information?" Jethro was not a happy camper at this evidence of hacking.

"I'm sorry Jethro but, I had to know if you could afford to live near us if that is your wish. If you couldn't, I would have changed the costs and paid the difference myself." Looking deadly serious for the first time Jethro finally got a good look at the man who controlled so much power. He hid his authority well behind a jovial, nerdy facade but, it was there, and he knew how to use it. "My first priority is, and always will be, the happiness of my Tasha. She loves you and you are all that is left of her family, therefore, you are very important to me."

Jethro wondered how much more of this emotional roller-coaster he could take; he needed a bit of distance before he started tearing up.

"Okay, I'll let you off for now but, stay out of my bank accounts from now on; I would like to pretend that they're private for a while longer."

Jethro switched gears quickly before Teril could justify interfering further.

"I need some private time with Triena to do some old fashioned courting so, can you assign her to assist me with the horse purchases? You could tell her I need a geneticist to help with checking bloodlines." Teril looked intrigued at Jethro's words.

"It will be no problem to assign Triena to you. However why do you need to court her? You are the Earthling and it is my understanding that as the Teeronite she must woo you. We Teeronites know immediately when we meet our life-mates you know." Teril seemed supremely puzzled by Jethro's lack of understanding.

Jethro decided to make his own mind up about that little misunderstanding. In his experience a man had to chase down a woman until she caught him and he didn't figure a Teeronite was any different. They were all Adam and Eve's children after all.

Jethro stood and squaring his shoulders decided to go in search of Triena to give her the good news about her new assignment and fill Sam in on the situation. Then, he would finally be able to leave and catch up with his much loved sister.

"I'm going to let Triena know about her helping me, before I leave for Tasha's unit. Are you taking me or another member of the crew?" Jethro queried Teril.

"I'll be taking you but, not for about twenty minutes. I want to make sure that all the details regarding your land purchase and house are taken care of before I dare face Tasha." He laughed happily. "I'm going to be extremely popular with my love." He kidded Jethro.

The two men parted as friends. They had known each other for only a few short minutes but, the bond was now firmly established.

Jethro's conversation with Triena had gone smoothly so, he was reasonably content to leave her on the Pod to finish up her present work; he now had time to plan his courtship. She'd seemed pleased to be joining him in his search for the right horses for the new stud farm.

He smiled reminiscently at how he had left her flustered and aware. With her smiling, happy face gazing up into his, Jethro just hadn't been able to resist the temptation; he had swooped down, pulling her into his hard arms and taking her lips in a short, fiery kiss that left her startled and blushing. Jethro's final thought before he joined Teril in the transporter, was that, at least he was clean this time; that had to have made a better impression on her.

He couldn't wait until morning when they were to start their search together.

Jethro and Teril descended from the transporter in a hanger at Coolangatta Airport, its arrival invisible and silent. The hanger had apparently been used successfully for years by the visitors from Teeron; it was in a part of the airport reserved for private aircraft and was only fifteen minutes drive away from Tasha's apartment.

Teril's hire car was parked just outside the hanger ready to transport them into town. Jethro marvelled at how well organised the Teeronites were. Teril had entertained Jethro on the flight in with the story of Tasha's apartment building and how it had come to be the main base on Earth for the Teeron visitors. Tasha jokingly called it 'The Alien Love Nest' as so many of the mixed bondings had happened here.

Two units were always kept vacant for the science team's use, the owner having been the first Earthling to bond with a Teeronite in modern times.

His story was legendary amongst the Teeronites as, after only knowing her for a few days, he had instantly left his apartment complex with a manager and accompanied his love back to Teeron. They were now the proud parents of twins and close neighbours to Tasha and Teril's new property.

Teril pulled into a parking bay in front of the beachside apartments. Eager to see Tasha and give her the news that Jethro was to be their neighbour, he exited the car in a rush, intent only on getting inside. Halfway to the front entrance he slowed and looked over his shoulder to check on Jethro's progress. The other man had walked towards the beach, and was just standing gazing out to sea, taking deep contented breaths of the salt air.

" _Hail Hera_ ," _he was an_ _idiot_ , he thought. The man had just left a war torn country, had watched his friends maimed and slaughtered and been nearly killed himself, all in the last week. Added to that, the news that he was part alien had to have rocked his world. And he, idiot that he was, just rushed around talking about land, houses and horses. He needed horse whipping himself for his lack of sensitivity.

Walking slowly back to the beach he stood quietly by Jethro's shoulder and just waited with him, lending his silent support.

Finally Jethro broke the silence.

"It feels good to be back. Just to watch the waves and smell the freedom in the air." Taking one final, deep breath Jethro turned, smiling wryly. "Let's go see my sister, you've been very patient but, I can feel your mind buzzing with excitement and it's driving me bonkers."

The two, tall, handsome men walked contentedly into the building and Jethro's true homecoming. His sister was the glue that held them all together.

Triena's eyes flew open as her com-watch beeped out the time. Slipping out of the silky shift that she'd slept in, she gazed out of her bedroom window, taking in the wonderful view of sand and sea before eagerly making her way into the shower.

Today she would see Jethro again, he was right here, in the unit above this one. Her need to watch his sexy, green eyes, light up in his hard, handsome face, almost choking her breath. " _Hail Hera_ " how she desired him, she wanted to warm her fingers in his curly, dark red hair, gaze into his luminous eyes. What wonderful colouring he and Tasha had, not the boring black hair and blue eyes of all Teeronites.

Thirty minutes later, dressed casually in jeans and a top, with breakfast well behind her, she nervously waited for Jethro to knock on her front door _. What was keeping him?_

She had sent Teril a message last night informing him that she had arrived at the apartments. A transporter had been leaving the pod for the Antarctic and had given her a ride to a darkened beach a few kilometres away; she had easily run the distance to the unit from there. Sending Teril an update he had replied informing her as to what time Jethro would pick her up.

She and Teril had been assigned this ground floor unit as their base on this tour of duty. However, since tracking down Tasha the man was never here, he happily spent all of his free time with Tasha; planning the wedding that was only a few days away now. Triena was beginning to understand the appeal; she wouldn't stray far from Jethro if she had the choice.

Teril didn't appear to be in the apartment so he had obviously got an even earlier start than her so, no chance of asking him what was in store for her today. A sharp knock sounded on the door startling her even though she had been impatiently waiting for it.

"Hustle up gorgeous, we've got a lot to do today, don't waste time primping and preening" Jethro's laughing voice reached through the door, setting her stomach churning and her heart pounding. " _Hail Hera_ " she was a nervous wreck already.

"Don't bellow, I'm coming," she replied as her fingers turned the lock on the door.

Jethro stood in the doorway a glint gleaming in his mischievous eyes. "Hello beautiful, let's hit the road, no time to waste if Teril is to impress my sister with his wedding gift."

Swooping in, he hugged her close and planted a warm kiss on her soft lips. Handing her a thumb drive with one hand he wrapped his other around her shoulders and, slamming her door shut, dragged her to a jeep that he casually mentioned he kept stored with Tasha. Triena barely had time to gather her thoughts; apparently the man was in a hurry to look at horses.

"Teril says you're able to access the data on this drive so, hopefully you can find me the best stallion matches with the mares that I've lined up for us to see today. I spent hours last night talking to old friends who bought some of our stock and others that have continued the bloodlines and improving them, we have appointments all day."

Jethro slammed the Jeep onto the road and eagerly flattened the accelerator. The man had plans and obviously couldn't wait to get started. Triena wondered wryly how she would be able to get his attention today.

"Where do you want me to go while you look at the horses?" Jethro turned stunned eyes in her direction.

"What do you mean? You'll be with me all the time. I need your input to narrow the field before I make my final decisions." Jethro pointed at the thumb drive he'd given her. "I loaded the 'Standard of Excellence' onto there. That will tell you what I'm aiming for. I can pick a good horse by its looks but, that doesn't mean it will throw a good foal. Your expertise and genetic programs should enable me to make the best selection in the shortest time." Triena finally relaxed, she now had all day to decide how to woo him.

Triena strode over one more hill; the latest in a long line of hills that she had walked over in the last five hours, and gazed at another Arab mare, the latest in a long line of mares. Sadly, these beautiful creatures were starting to become one large blur in her memory. How Jethro kept going with such obvious enthusiasm was beyond her.

Triena was prepared to love these gorgeous creatures; she just needed time to get accustomed to them. Their size and spirit were unique in her experience. On Teeron the largest animal they had was a Daron. A four legged animal that strongly resembled Earth's deer in shape and colour but, being slightly heavier in size. They ran wild in the forests of Teeron, safe from the vegetarian humans.

She caught up to Jethro as he once again walked straight up to the mare he had selected to view. She didn't move away or appear afraid; in fact she walked up and nuzzled Jethro's hand as he crooned silly nonsense to her. Triena was intrigued by the animal's behaviour, she might not know anything about the conformation of Arabs but, she knew this wasn't normal horse behaviour. Jethro had walked straight up to every horse they had looked at today and none had moved away from him.

Jethro carried on inspecting the beautiful bay mare with the big wide spaced eyes and swan like neck, running his hands over her back and down her legs, lifting each hoof to check for any problems, all without bothering to put on a halter. The owner just shook his head in disbelief at how calm she was.

"I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself. I don't know anyone else who can walk straight up to this mare. I told you on the phone I needed time to catch her; we usually have to run the whole mob up the hill and into the yards to get close to her. She's a beauty but, usually a nightmare to catch, that's why I offered her for sale. I haven't got the time to spend on problem horses."

Jethro just smiled innocently over at Triena as he asked her to check the bloodlines and availability of compatible frozen semen.

It was no surprise to him that he had been able to catch her. He had inherited another gift from his Teeron ancestor, besides the one for languages, one only he and Tasha knew about. If he was one-on-one with a human or animal he could control their thoughts. He just needed his subject to be relaxed before he tuned into them. He'd contacted this mare before they even came over the brow of the hill; she'd been happily waiting for him.

"We'll wait to breed the mares, give them a few months to settle down and adjust to the change in feed." He spoke to Jeff, the owner, as he waited patiently for Triena to work the ereader-like device that she carried with her. His arm casually around the mare's neck, they both waited for her decision.

The com-pad was apparently powerful enough to access international data because in only a few seconds she looked up smiling in success.

"Compatible semen is available in the USA; it can be acquired in your time frame." Jethro smiled and clucking to the mare got her to walk alongside them back to the stables.

Jethro turned to Jeff holding out his hand to the other man. "It's a deal, shake on it and I'll yard her for you. I've arranged agistment on a friend's property near Nerang so I'll pick her up and the other two we've decided on, in the next couple of days."

"Good luck with her. I'll look forward to seeing her offspring at the shows."

Jethro roared with laughter and wrapping his arm around Triena's slender waist; hugged her close to share the joke.

"I hope you do but, my sister is moving overseas so these horses will only be shown outside of Australia."

Triena basked in the happy glow emanating from Jethro. She took the opportunity to snuggle in close and feel the warmth of his body soak into her skin. _"Hail Hera" love was the most amazing feeling._ How she needed to get on with the courting of Jethro James.

Chapter 7

Thirty minutes later Jethro pulled into a quaint pub in Canungra for lunch. The studs they had visited this morning had all been close by, in the foothills of a mountain range leading to the Lamington National Park and O'Reilly's. This was their first break since they had left the coast and just what Triena needed to further her cause.

Jethro headed for the shady, garden restaurant, which luckily was empty of other patrons at this time of day. She needed to get his undivided attention if she was to win his love.

Before she was even settled into her seat, Jethro started to eagerly talk about the land he had bought on Teeron.

"Teril sent a video of the land to your com-pad address, have a look and tell me what you think, honey. I hope you'll like it as much as I do." Triena sat frozen in her seat, too scared that she was misunderstanding him to say anything.

"Why is it important to you that I like it?" She finally managed to query shakily.

"Well, I figured that we would eventually be living there full time so, you need to feel comfortable there. You've handled getting up close and personal with the horses so, I know they won't be a problem to you."

Reaching for the menu he continued speaking. "I'll teach you to ride as soon as we get the horses settled, you'll love it," he finished happily, satisfaction oozing out of him as he reached for the menu.

Triena was first stunned, and then vaguely disgruntled. No talk of love, no professing undying faithfulness. She knew that Earthlings approached bonding in a different way to Teeronites but, wasn't he being just a little too casual in his approach? She was about to tell him that he could kiss the bonding goodbye when, she noticed how white his knuckles were as they fiercely gripped the menu, a waiting tension tightened his lips.

"I would be honoured to view the land that you have bought," she answered softly, love welling up to choke her voice. "I'm sure it is perfect."

Jethro let the breath out that he'd been holding in and rushed into speech. "Teril has already organised the house builder. I just have to send through the plans once we've decided what we want." Triena smiled serenely at his, once again, 'in command' tone.

The next minute Triena found herself sprawled across Jethro's knee being kissed senseless. Strong, long fingered hands kneaded her slender back and waist, moulding her hips in a firm grip, every sensitive nerve ending found and stroked into screaming desire, setting her core on fire with searing lust. Firm lips nibbled around the soft skin of her neck, sending shivers of desire into her breasts and tightening her nipples into tight buds of need. Jethro's breath was like a blast furnace on her skin, as he scorched a path over tender flesh on his way to her lips. Once there he took them in a soul destroying kiss.

The approach of the waiter into the garden was the only thing that saved her from melting onto the ground and begging for immediate consummation. Jethro tenderly lifted her back into her seat, giving her a loving look, before picking the menu back up.

" _Hail Hera"_ Jethro had made his intentions clear with that kiss.

Triena went through the rest of the day in a dreamy haze, trying to get her mind organised enough to plan the courting ritual, while all the time staying composed enough to be of help to Jethro.

By the end of the day Triena's mind was buzzing with plans for her formal proposal, also what she would buy Jethro as his wedding gift. Her Executon would need to be consulted but, she thought that he would be willing to stretch the cargo to one more horse. Also, Teril would need to be brought in on her plan to help with the surprise. She was feeling more cheerful by the minute that she could pull off this part of the bonding ritual successfully.

Triena settled back in her seat and watched Jethro's strong fingers skilfully guide the jeep down the steep mountain roads towards the coast and home. She shivered as she remembered the desire those same fingers could evoke from her body. She quickly switched her mind away from Jethro and to the coming evening, she needed to keep her mind on the job at hand.

Teril was cooking a BBQ dinner on the beach for them all tonight. he had really embraced the casual lifestyle after discovering vegetarian sausages and hamburgers in a local shop, much to Tasha's delight. Tasha loved the man but, she wasn't about to abandon her BBQ for him.

Triena just wanted time with her man away from horse people. "Hail Hera" these people were fanatical. They would talk for hours about bloodlines and horses they had seen or owned, then hike five kilometres across rough paddocks to view a foal, all while cheerfully negotiating for the best price or the next horse.

Jethro had purchased a stunning chestnut mare late this afternoon and had happily knocked the owner down several thousand dollars with the promise of immediate payment. They both shook on the deal with a smile so Triena had to assume that this was how you bought a horse.

Jethro planned on travelling interstate to visit a renowned Arab stud in the morning. The stud carried several mares with the bloodlines they wanted so he was confident that Teril would have his gift in place by the time the wedding took place. Triena had already booked a hire car and their flights. He needed time with Triena now. This plan of his to keep her by his side while horse hunting, was fine, as far as it went but, he hadn't found any free time to court her yet.

Later that evening Triena found herself alone with Tasha in the kitchen, clearing up after the BBQ. It had been a friendly meal however, Triena wasn't able to relax in case she let slip what she and Jethro had been up to. Jethro had just casually mentioned said that he and Triena had gone for a drive to visit some old friends of his.

"I'm so glad that Jethro has found you," Tasha said enthusiastically. "Hopefully he'll leave the army now and settle down somewhere safe."

"I'm not sure that he plans to leave the army just yet." Triena replied in confusion. "Why would meeting me make him change his career?"

"Surely he will want to stay home with you full time, either here or on Teeron?" Tasha's smile slipped slightly as she waited for Triena's reply.

"Jethro has not mentioned leaving the army just yet but, I did hear him mention to Sam that he was looking forward to his training rotation back in Perth."

"Damn! I was hoping that he would leave the army now, he's given it enough years of his life." Tasha studied Triena's face closely. "Aren't you worried for his safety?"

"I've spent too many years as a guardian to worry over what can't be changed. A warrior's heart will always lead him to fight for the weak and oppressed. I understand your brother's need to protect." Triena smiled conspiratorially with Tasha. "Perhaps we can persuade him to become a guardian on Teeron where he wouldn't have to fight in wars. We will cross our fingers, yes?"

"Yes," answered a much happier Tasha. Giving Triena a quick hug she kept her arm around the other woman's waist as she led the way in friendly harmony to where the men waited in the lounge.

Jethro rose from his seat as soon as the women appeared.

"Time to get you home, honey, you need to be fresh for our flight in the morning. Luckily the airport is only fifteen minutes drive away." As he spoke, Jethro tucked Triena's arm under his and firmly led her to the front door, ignoring Tasha's appeal for them to have a cup of coffee first.

He'd told Tasha that he was taking Triena to see the Opera House and The Sydney Harbour Bridge as a cover for their trip to Sydney. Speaking over his shoulder he added. "I'll be back as soon as I've got Triena's safely inside her unit."

Triena felt her heart racing as, Jethro pulled her close to his side while they descended the stairs to the ground floor. This was the closest she'd been to him since the kiss at lunchtime and all her female hormones were screaming with joy. She found herself holding her breath as her heart raced and a lump lodged in her throat, breathing didn't seem important anyway. Turning her face casually into his neck, she sneakily breathed in his unique male scent.

Warm lips reached down and captured hers in a kiss so tender that she felt like crying with the relief at the love she felt in it. If this man wasn't her true life-mate she didn't think one existed. Every feeling she had ever heard about seemed to be in this tender claiming kiss.

Jethro relaxed his hold on her shoulders to turn her fully into his strong arms, melding them together from chest to knee in an embrace that made the one at lunchtime pale in comparison. She only realised that they had reached her front door when the knob punched her in the back as Jethro leant in for another blistering kiss. She must have made a sound of distress because he immediately broke the kiss and leaned away.

"Are you okay?" He frowned. "Did I hurt you?" Jethro looked worried as he waited for her answer.

"No, I'm fine, just the door knob pressing into my back." she replied softly, lifting heavy eye lids to try and focus on his handsome face.

"Damn! You'd think at my age I'd be able to kiss a woman goodnight without maiming her, wouldn't you?" He muttered in disgust. "I'm sorry, honey, I got so involved in you that I forgot where we were. Forgive me?" His sexy green eyes smiled beguilingly into hers.

"Oh yes, I believe I would forgive you just about anything." Triena was starting to believe that was true, she needed some thinking time before she said or did something absolutely stupid. Time to go inside.

"I'll see you in the morning, about six?" She questioned, as she turned to unlock the door. Teril would be arriving soon to occupy the second bedroom and she didn't want him to catch her necking at the front door. Not a good impression to give her boss.

"Six it is, if that's what you say. You're in charge of our travel arrangements." Pulling her close he kissed her swiftly one last time, before turning to run up the stairs.

Triena closed the door and drifted dreamily through the unit to her room, tomorrow couldn't come fast enough for her.

Chapter 8

The trip from the Gold Coast to Sydney had gone smoothly. Jethro had knocked on her door at six, greeting her with a brief, but, oh so satisfying kiss, before getting them to the airport in record time.

The Sydney traffic had been a nightmare and it had taken the help of the in–car navigation system to get them out of the city and into the suburbs. They were now happily driving down the main road to Windsor, a mostly rural suburb on the outskirts of the city. The stud they were visiting was only a few minutes away now.

Tall wrought iron electronic gates guarded the stud's entry, blocking access to casual visitors. They had to announce themselves into an intercom system before they were granted an entrée; obviously security was taken seriously here. A sign halfway down the drive pointed the way down another road to the stable complex. It seemed that this stud was all business and not the friendly, relaxed kind that they had visited yesterday.

No cuppa on the veranda today, thought Triena.

A tall, immaculately dressed man, who looked to be in his forties, emerged from a doorway and approached their car.

"Hi, I'm John, the stud manager. I believe you wanted to inspect some of our Scimitar bred mares?" The man spoke crisply though not in an unfriendly manner. Jethro didn't seem fazed by all the security and professionalism so Triena had to assume this was not an unusual set-up.

"Hi, yes, I'm Jethro and this is Triena." Jethro said, with a nod in Triena's direction, before continuing. "We're a little early for our appointment I hope that won't inconvenience you?" Jethro raised one eyebrow, querying the other man, however not really expecting a refusal. After all big money was involved here.

"That's not a problem, thank you for your concern; however we are always ready for buyers, international or interstate."John spoke calmly and with authority. Triena bet this man ran a tight ship.

"I can't wait to see some of the beauties that I've only seen in magazines. I've spent too many years overseas in the last ten years to have been able to attend many shows."Jethro spoke with enthusiasm as he exited the car.

John opened the door for Triena giving her a good look over as he helped her out of the car. "I'm happy to welcome you to our stud." He murmured in a deep, sexy voice; a little too much emphasis on the 'you' in Jethro's opinion.

Jethro wondered how much extra it would cost him for the mare if he punched the oily salesman in his grinning mouth. The man hadn't moved his eyes off of Triena's breasts since he'd opened the door. Suddenly the man dropped Triena's hand like it was on fire.

"Oh, I'm sorry," she gushed in apparent sincerity. "I usually don't offer my hand after a car trip. Static electricity you know?"

That's my girl chuckled Jethro to himself. Don't mess with a guardian if you don't want to get burned. Luckily, he was fireproof with this particular guardian, but, he wondered what trick she'd used to zap him? He'd make sure he found out later.

"My fiancé has an affinity with electricity," Chuckled Jethro. "Fortunately I'm not affected."

John suddenly lost all interest in Triena and became all business, leading the way to the stables.

Triena trailed after them happily, after all, Jethro's fiancé had to get used to horses hadn't she?

Triena prepared to spend a few hours in Jethro's wake, as he checked every inch, of every horse on the property.

She was totally surprised when Jethro quickly chose only three mares to inspect out of the fifteen offered. He wasn't wasting any time with friendly conversation, instead made his choices swiftly and asked for them to be displayed. Triena had to admit that the indoor arena that John used to show the mares was first class. They all leaned on the arena rail and watched the mare's floating gaits as they trotted and cantered around, displaying at liberty, one after the other.

Jethro was obviously impressed by all three but, it would all come down to available sperm as to which mare he eventually picked. Jethro signalled Triena to run her AI searches and sat back to watch the last mare in the arena spin and rear in obvious joy at her freedom from her stable.

John was quietly watching the mare with Jethro when he made a suggestion. "Would you like to view our stallion barn? The mares you've picked out are excellent but, one that is already in foal to our Scimitar bloodline could possibly be a better buy for you."

"My problem is that these mares are to be shipped overseas for my sister's new stud. I didn't want to risk one slipping a foal due to transit stress." Jethro was obviously wavering; the quality of these animals was mouth watering.

"I think with a little care it could be done successfully. Come and check our stallions before you decide. We limit the get of our senior stallion to only a few a year and the mare that I'm thinking of has just gone into foal to him."

Once in the stallion barn Jethro got a familiar glazed look in his eye and Triena knew they would be there for awhile. John had the senior stallion displayed, in another, even bigger arena than the last. Jethro drooled; there was no other word for it, he drooled. John grinned at Jethro's avid gaze.

"Would you like to see the mare I mentioned that's in foal to this boy?" Did he change your mind about a mare in foal?" John tempted.

"I'm impressed but, I have to think about the transport. However, I'd be interested to see her before I decide." Jethro was clearly torn by the decision he had to make."

Triena sorry for him, he so obviously wanted to take them all. They entered yet another immaculate barn and walked down a centre aisle with large loose boxes on each side, several had horses in them. "These mares have just been vet tested that's why they're inside, all are proven in foal and have certificates." said John. "The chestnut in the end stall is the one I thought would fit into your breeding program."

Halfway down the barn a delicate head with wide spaced eyes and flaring nostrils lifted her head over the door and watched their approach. Her short, pricked ears twitched towards them, obviously listening to John's voice.

"What's that beauty's story?" Asked Jethro, as he glanced over the door at the dapple grey mare inside and became immediately smitten. From her delicate head, short, level back, to her straight legs and deep, wide chest, she was a beauty. Jethro felt a sadness that he couldn't explain as he rubbed a gentle hand under her chin.

"She can't run with other horses for some strange reason," answered John. She has to be yarded and stabled or the other mares chase her all day. We've been putting her in with the weanlings but, she just stands miserably in a corner and they avoid her. The stud owner has made the decision to recoup his purchase price by selling her in foal to our senior stallion; she's just too much trouble for a stud of this size." He shook his head in perplexity. "I've never come across this problem before." However, as much as I'd like you to buy her, I don't think she will suit your needs."

Jethro rubbed her chin gently for several seconds, and then reluctantly left her to check out the chestnut mare. A quick look and he made his decision. "No, I think I'll stick with one of the three that we looked at earlier as long as Triena has had success finding available sperm." Jethro replied.

Triena took her com-pad over to Jethro and showed him her results.

"Okay, that looks good." Thanking her, he turned to John letting him know his decision. "I'll take the bay mare, as long as we can settle on a fair price and transport to the Gold Coast can be arranged in the next two days."

"I'm sure we'll be able to come to an agreement," smiled John. The oily salesman back on full display again.

Triena followed them closely, listening to the negotiations carefully. She was a fast learner and was sure she would be able to buy the grey mare for Jethro that he so obviously wanted. Whatever was wrong with her he would fix, she was sure of that. " _Hail Hera_ " She thought happily, she was going into the horse breeding business with her fiancé.

While Jethro sat in the manager's office and negotiated with John, Triena slipped outside pretending she wanted to use the toilet facilities.

Once far enough away from the office she used her com-pad to quickly contact Jethro's friend that she had met yesterday, begging his help in arranging her surprise gift for Jethro. Jeff enthusiastically joined in on her plans, offering all the help she wanted.

Triena filled him in on the mare's details and gave him a budget to work with, crossing her fingers in the hope of success. Jeff promised to ring the stud owner immediately and deal directly with him, bypassing the manager. Apparently the owner was a friend of his father and would deal with Jeff. If successful he would then contact her with all the details for her to deposit the agreed amount into the stud owner's account.

After leaving the stud Jethro drove them back into the city for a late lunch by the harbour followed by a sightseeing tour of the Opera House and a close-up look at the famous bridge. He said it was only to add authenticity to their trip but, he seemed very content walking her around the sights.

Triena would have been just as happy walking through mud with him as, Jethro kept her tucked lovingly under his arm most of the time.

Triena still hadn't heard from Jeff by the time their flight landed at Coolangatta airport, she was beginning to think that she'd failed Jethro. "Hail Hera," she had been so sure that the mare would be his.

Triena became aware that Jethro was speaking to her; he'd obviously had to repeat an earlier question and was giving her a curious look. She'd better pay attention or he was going to get suspicious.

"Sorry Jethro, what did you say?"

"I said. Are you okay? You've hardly spoken a word since we left Sydney airport." Jethro was worried that she was getting bored with all of the rushing around.

"I'm fine, thank you." Triena had to think fast. "I didn't mean to be so withdrawn. I was just trying to memorise all the bloodlines and fit them to the horses we saw today. I'm stunned by their beauty."

Triena laughed softly as she thought of how popular Tasha was going to be. "Everyone on Teeron is going to want to visit Tasha when we get them home."

Jethro smiled reminiscently. "They certainly are beauties. I'm looking forward to getting to the stage when I can afford to stock my own land."

He frowned when a new thought hit him. "I need to speak to Teril about fencing the land ready for these mares. He'll need to get that done before they arrive and it might be cheaper if we get both properties done at once. We can run it as just one big property for the moment."

A deeply, satisfied look, crossed his face. "Yep, that's the way to go. Once we're all settled in on Teeron we can work on the internal fencing." Jethro seemed taken up thinking about this new arrangement so Triena was able to go back to worrying about her own problems.

Please, please, contact me soon, Jeff, Triena begged silently.

Chapter 9

It was close to ten o'clock that night before Jeff finally contacted Triena. Her com-pad beeped and she just sat and stared at it for endless moment, too afraid to open the email. She had spent the evening alone and tense, unable to eat or sit still until she had news of Jethro's mare. Now here it was, and she was too afraid to tap the screen.

Teril had met them as soon as they drove up and whisked Jethro away to the pod, to check arrangements for the horse's transportation, house plans and now, fencing. Teril was determined that Tasha's wedding gift would be perfect. The man would do whatever was necessary to make his life-mate happy.

Luckily, Tasha had been too busy to notice all of the activity as she had spent all of her spare time organising their wedding. It was to take place the following Saturday, on the beach in front of the apartment building.

Now, Triena had to face the news in the email, good or bad. Giving the screen a firm tap she held her breath as she read. Not believing what she had read, she started all over again. It still said the same thing, also, that Triena was welcome to ring Jeff immediately if she cared to discuss the matter. Triena immediately used the video phone on the com-pad to ring him.

Jeff was sitting at his computer and answered immediately with a huge grin on his face.

"Hi Triena, what do you think of our news?"

"I'm stunned, how did you do it?"

"Buying her was the easy part. Getting her delivered was what has taken me so long, I've only just tracked down a friend who is coming up here to a show in a couple of days and will bring her directly to me." He laughed happily. "I can't wait to see old Jethro's face when he finds out what you've done for him.

The good news was starting to sink in, making Triena shake with relief.

"I was so afraid that you were having trouble buying her; that I didn't have enough money. Now you've managed to buy her for half what I would have paid."

"That was never a problem. Old Frank is a good guy and when I told him what kind of home Jethro would give her, he was only too happy to sell at a reasonable price. You've got her for only a little more than the price of the service to his stallion." Jeff sounded satisfied with the deal he'd made and Triena was only too happy to give him credit for his work.

"I can't thank you enough for what you've done. I'll deposit the purchase money immediately into the account you've sent me. I would also like to pay you or buy you something special, as thanks, if you'd let me." Triena asked tentatively, not sure of the etiquette involved in thanking someone for this kind of favour. She didn't want to insult him.

"I tell you what. If you really want to do something special for me, you can buy tickets for the three of us to go to the 'The Australian Outback Spectacular' next Tuesday. I've been meaning to go for years and even though it's just down the road, I've never managed to get there." Jeff cheerfully filled in Triena on the show and food that brought the outback alive, in a unique experience for the audience.

Triena agreed instantly, working her com-pad swiftly as she continued to listen to Jeff's enthusiastic conversation. She spotted a 'Top Rail Package' and immediately booked it for the three of them.

Triena broke into Jeff's happy monologue to inform him of what she'd done. "I can't wait to go if it's as good as you say.

"It's even better. Jethro will be happy as a pig in mud when he finds out. But you shouldn't have paid all of that money over. I've got friends that work there and they would have given you a discount, too late now you've paid, I'm afraid."

Triena felt a light bulb go on inside her head and a slow smile spread across her face. "Jeff, would it be possible for you to arrange a special event there for me? I want to make a formal proposal to Jethro and present him with his mare as an engagement gift. Do you think it could be done?" She asked, hopefully.

"I'm not sure. They do arrange parties and things so you might be lucky. Leave it with me and I'll see what can be done. I'll get back to you as soon as I have some info." Jeff started to laugh and seemed to be having trouble stopping. Triena was confused.

"What's so funny Jeff? Don't you like the idea?" Triena asked, worried that she was making a big mistake.

"It's just the thought of Jethro's face when you propose in front of a thousand people. Luckily I know he's crazy about you." Jeff scratched his head in puzzlement. "I thought you were already engaged though?"

"Yes. Jethro has made his intentions clear but, there still remains the matter of the formal proposal that I have to make. Teril, my superior, made it all very clear to me." Triena answered casually, not noticing Jeff's complete confusion as she busily plotted away in her head.

They ended their conversation soon after that, with Jeff still laughing.

Triena went to bed that night to happily dream of flying horses and Jethro walking towards her, smiling, with love in his eyes.

The next few days passed slowly, with Triena back on the pod doing further tests on Sam's blood work and genetic trace. As she had suspected he was a Teeron descendent and she now had to try and link him to one of the two blood lines. He was either a relative of Jethro's or Jenna's.

Jenna had been the first Teeron descendent to be discovered on Earth. Triena worked tirelessly, her work essential if they were to trace all of the living descendents of those distant unrecorded bondings.

At least the work kept her from missing Jethro too much. He had been spending all his time with Teril, as they raced to put the final touches on the house plans before the wedding. Triena and Jethro had only managed a few hurried, desperate kisses and too brief embraces as they passed in the hallway of the units or the pod. Both were looking forward to next week when they would have more time for each other.

At least now Triena had her proposal plans to give her something to work on. Jeff had contacted Triena and gleefully informed her that their plans had been approved and were in place. Jethro's mare had arrived safely from Sydney and had settled in well. Jeff would take her to the Australian Outback Spectacular venue on Tuesday afternoon and settle her in a stable ready for the big reveal.

Jeff was enjoying his part in the proposal. He'd never seen a big, tough, SASR melt before but, he figured it was going to happen on Tuesday. He silently laughed to himself every time he thought of it. He'd known Jethro for years and never seen him lose his composure. He figured he would see it happen on Tuesday night.

Teril and Tasha's wedding went off without a hitch if you didn't count the bride breaking down into happy tears after they exchanged vows and Teril presented Tasha with the plans for their new stud. Teril had a large screen, video presentation set up on the altar they were standing in front of. The large screen was big enough for all the guests to see the land, with a 3D presentation overlay of the house and the mares grazing there. Teril had been careful not to include a view of the twin suns. No point in making the Earthling guests curious.

There was then a more realistic view of the house foundations going in and the fences being built. Teril was so pleased with himself that he picked his new bride up and spun her around until she was laughing happily again, all tears dried up.

Jeff had been invited to the event as had Sam and Staren. Jethro wandered over to talk to Jeff who was looking slightly bemused as Jethro approached him. "What's up buddy, don't like the beer?" Jethro grinned.

"No, the beers fine, it's the guests that have me curious. Do all of Teril's family and friends come out of the same mould? I've never seen so many tall, black haired, good looking people in one place in my life. It could give a man an inferiority complex," he complained good-naturedly.

Jethro roared with laughter. "You get used to it after a while. They're certainly a good looking family that's for sure. The region they were all born in hasn't married outsiders for hundreds of years. Tasha will liven up that gene pool, that's for sure."

Jethro looked over at a glowing Triena in her soft, flowing bridesmaid's dress. "Of course my Triena is the best looking of the lot." He stated with certainty in his voice.

Jeff grinned back at him "You wouldn't be biased now, would you? I tell you what, find me a woman that looks like Triena and can ride and I'll marry her tomorrow."

Jethro gave him a sniggering smile before answering. "Careful what you're asking for, I just might do that little thing." Slapping Jeff happily on the back he left him to go and make some time with his fiancé, it seemed years since he'd managed more than two words with her.

He had last seen her yesterday when Teril had called him into the command centre where Triena waited to announce her official proposal plans. He'd been stunned and amused to be wooed by his own fiancé, however, after seeing Teril's serious expression he'd thought better of cracking a smile and accepted graciously. This was obviously serious business to a Teeronite. He still hadn't worked out why Jeff was part of the evening but, wasn't going to question Triena's arrangements.

"Hi sweetheart, you look beautiful." Jethro tucked her carefully into his side as he led her away from the crowd around Tasha and Teril. "If your bridesmaid duties are over I think I'll kidnap you," he whispered into her neck as he breathed in her exotic scent and nibbled on her ear.

Jethro's caresses sent thrilling shivers racing up and down Triena's spine. " _Hail Hera_ " this man of hers was temptation on two legs.

"I think I'm supposed to help Tasha change before they leave on their wedding trip to O'Reilley's Rainforest Retreat. After that, I'm afraid I have to go back to the pod to continue with the work until Teril returns on Monday." Resignation was clear in Triena's voice.

"Damn it, I've hardly seen you this past week. Will you have more free time when Teril gets back?" Jethro grumbled, as he hugged her close.

"Yes, usually we're able to rotate our lab time so that we both have time off. However, this tour we've done so much travelling that the lab work is badly behind. "Triena looked uneasy as she continued. "We leave for home in two weeks and the work must be finished by then."

"I promised Teril I'd return with him to help Tasha with the horses, will you be stuck here if the work isn't done before the pod leaves?" He asked, tension tightening his shoulders.

"No, I'm due leave and will return even if the work isn't completed. Teril, however, would have to stay here." That comment sobered both of them.

"In that case I won't hassle you about the hours you're working." He grimaced humorously. "I won't like it but, I'll live with it, we all need to go home together."He leaned down to nibble her lips playfully. Triena giggled, she couldn't believe that she was doing it but, she actually giggled. Jethro groaned in disgust.

"Don't laugh at me you minx. I'm due back on base in seven weeks and I need lots of time with you before then." He bent swiftly and picking her up swung in a circle as he hugged her close. "Let's dance so that I can hold you until you have to leave me again." He kissed her slowly and thoroughly before letting her feet touch the ground.

Triena spent the next few hours in a daze of love and laughter, as Jethro lavished loving caresses on her, right up until his final, searing kiss goodbye.

" _Hail Hera_ ," she thought, later that night as she slipped into bed. Her brain stopped working whenever Jethro was near, but, oh, how she wanted to be back in his strong arms.

Chapter 10

Triena didn't know how she had made it on time but, here she was, dressed in new jeans, shirt and riding boots, a surprise present from Jethro, standing in the foyer of the 'Australian Outback Spectacular.' She had worked so many hours over the last two days that, sleep was only a distant memory.

Now here she was, ready for the biggest challenge of her life. Teril had told her that a formal proposal was expected and " _Hail Hera_ ", she would do it even if it embarrassed the life out of her. No guardian ever backed down from a challenge. Jethro was going to be asked to bond with her for life in front of all these strangers, even if she had a heart attack in the process.

"Where the hell is Jeff? I want to get settled in our seats." Jethro grumbled impatiently. "I don't understand why he has to be part of our formal date anyway. Is he some sort of official chaperone?

"I'm sure he'll be here in a second. Jeff is an essential part of the formal proposal. I'm sure we'll enjoy his company."

Jeff had actually been here all afternoon making last minute arrangements. He'd contacted Triena to let her know that the mare was settled and happy and their plans were all running smoothly.

"Yeah, I like old Jeff; I just don't get his role in our special night." he queried. Finally he spotted Jeff in the crowd. "Hey, over here." Jethro waved enthusiastically at him, attracting plenty of admiring looks in the process.

Jethro would never pass unnoticed in a crowd, thought Triena, his military bearing, good looks and commanding presence guaranteeing him immediate attention.

Jeff quickly joined them, giving Triena a secretive wink and nod when Jethro turned away. After that they were soon seated and ready for a night to remember.

Triena held her breath so many times during the performance that she almost passed out. From the simulated outback scenes, with rain and thunder, to the helicopter set into the roof of the venue that appeared to help with the muster, she was mesmerised. But, the most thrilling part of the evening, she thought, was the magnificent horses and their brilliant riders.

The part of the performance that Triena really enjoyed was when two, supposedly, rival stations, challenged the stockmen and women of each to a competition. The patrons were divided into two teams and were given the opportunity the cheer for their station's competitors. Triena pulled the hat she had been given, down hard on her head and cheered herself hoarse. Sitting between the two tall men she didn't notice the grinning looks the two men gave her over the top of her head. They were enjoying the show but, Triena's obvious enthusiasm entertained them both.

"I don't think you're going to have too much trouble getting your fiancé on a horse." laughed Jeff, grinning in delight at Triena's flushed face."I think if she was offered a chance to be part of this show right now, she'd be down there like a shot.

"I would have married her anyway but, I have to admit that sharing a horse property with her sounds like heaven to me," smiled Jethro in satisfaction.

At the conclusion of the show Triena was shocked back into reality by her face appearing on the thirty five metre screen that had been used with the show. It only now occurred to her that she hadn't planned this part of the proposal. Jethro looked confused but, not alarmed, as he turned to her with a raised eyebrow. Suddenly, the music stopped and a lovely young woman, who had taken part in the show, spoke over the sound system from the arena below.

"Ladies and gentlemen, if you would please stay seated for a few more minutes. We invite you all to help the friend of ours on screen celebrate a special moment in her life." She laughed happily as she punched the air. "We were all sworn to secrecy and, what do you know, we actually pulled it off."

The audience roared with laughter, happily settling back in their seats to see what extra entertainment awaited them.

Just then a man appeared next to Jeff and handed a microphone along to him as simultaneously the large screen came alive and Triena's face was replaced by a live shot of her and Jethro sitting in their seats. The audience buzzed with excitement.

"Here you go Triena; the rest is up to you now." Jeff handed over the mike with a gentle smile as he moved away.

Triena turned to Jethro who looked confused but, not uncomfortable. It would take more than an audience of a thousand to make an SASR uneasy. Triena got down on one knee in front of Jethro and gazed steadily into his face, the scene playing out on the huge screen. The whole auditorium went quiet, waiting for what would come next.

"Jethro James, you have already accepted me as your life-mate and committed to being with me until death. This is my formal acceptance and proposal to you. I will love you and only you until death parts us. I will share your life and defend it with my own life if needed. Do you accept me?" Triena waited bravely for whatever he would do or say now, she felt everyone near her holding their breath.

Jethro was so moved by Triena's beautifully formal proposal that he found it hard to speak. He finally understood the importance of this moment to the Teeronites.

"Triena I accept willingly and eagerly. I also will lay down my life to protect you if needed. You are the only woman in the universe for me." Jethro's reply was as formal as he could manage on such short notice. He didn't dare kiss this beautiful woman yet, he just knew it wouldn't be appropriate but, oh, how he wanted to.

The crowd erupted into cheers and whistles, enjoying the unusual proposal. When the noise died down Triena continued speaking, still on one knee.

"Jethro James, please do me the honour of accepting this gift as a symbol of my love for you." Triena quickly looked for Jeff's nod, before pointing at the arena.

Jethro looked down as did everyone else. Swelling, romantic music filled the venue as the arena glowed with soft blue lights, artificial mist covered the ground, bathing the whole area in a misty fantasy light, then, out of the mist exploded a magical creature, floating over the ground almost as if she were dancing to the music. Jethro's mare had arrived.

The grey mare played in the arena for several minutes, running, slide-stopping and wheeling; showing all her paces as if to say 'look at me, aren't I perfection?' Jethro watched for seconds, just as mesmerised by the performance as the rest of the audience.

Then, turning to look down at Triena he smiled happily, lifting her into his warm, safe arms for a quick hug, and a whispered. "Only you could have thought of this. No one else could understand how I feel about this mare."

Seconds later he was in the arena, approaching his wonderful gift. The audience were in an uproar. Several shouts of, "I'll marry you" followed by, "she wouldn't have you mate" caused loud, happy laughter to fill the auditorium.

Everyone quieted as Jethro reached out a hand and rubbed the mare's neck, softly speaking to her. She stood quietly for a minute and then, tail flagged high; she took off to float around the arena, showing Jethro and everyone else just how beautiful she was.

Jethro laughed happily and then waved Triena over to stand next to him, his arm over her shoulders, hugging her to his side.

He held up his hand, signalling the mare to come to him. She instantly stopped her display and calmly walked up to them, waiting for Jethro's command.

To the absolute joy of the watchers Jethro stood alongside her and with a slight hand signal had her bowing down on one leg in front of Triena. Jethro dropped to one knee beside the mare and at the same time produced a ring box from his shirt pocket. The crown went wild. This unusual engagement was an added bonus to an already fabulous night out.

Triena opened the box and taking the sapphire and diamond ring out, placed it on her finger. The place erupted with cheers as Jethro stood, taking Triena into his arms for a gentle kiss. The mare casually rose and nudged Jethro in the back, causing the whole auditorium to laugh uproariously, she wanted attention too. The happy laughter broke the magical mood, ending an evening never to be forgotten.

Soon after, all the lights were turned up and a friendly voice announced the end of the evening's entertainment. Everyone was thanked for their attendance and the evening was brought to a swift close.

Thirty minutes later they were on their way home, the past hour a cherished memory. Jethro just wanted to get his brand new 'official fiance' home now, so that he could do some serious, private courting.

Jeff had once more taken charge of the mare and promised to keep her safe until Jethro could pick her up. He would be forever indebted to his friend for all of his help.

Pulling Triena even tighter into his side as he drove, he brought up the number one question on his mind.

"When do we bond, get married, whatever you do on Teeron?" he demanded.

"We can have the ceremony when we return to Teeron. Your family will be there and so will all of mine. It is only a simple ceremony of exchanged vows. Triena explained.

"Good, then let's do it as soon as we land." he pleaded, desperate to get on with their life together.

Triena spent the rest of the evening in blissful oblivion as Jethro's kisses and caresses carried her to another world. It wasn't Teeron or Earth; it was a place that only the two of them knew about. _"Hail Hera_ " love was wonderful.

Chapter 11

Two hectic weeks later, Jethro was grooming his mare in one of the stables that had been especially made for the pod. Tasha was further down the row, taking care of one of hers. They had worked tirelessly to outfit the pod and load enough feed and medicine to get them through several months on Teeron. Everything that they could think of had now been done, including buying rugs, farrier gear and saddlery.

A familiar footstep behind him told him Triena had joined him.

"The Executon has given me permission to help you and Tasha with the horses while we make the jump through the worm hole." She smiled happily. "Just think, we'll be home soon and you will finally be able to see your land."

Jethro looked down into her beautiful delicate features and playfully wound her glossy pony tail around his hand before replying.

"As long as you're there with me, anywhere will be a perfect home."

They smiled into each other's eyes as a faint vibration could be felt under foot. The pod had left her tether and ventured into the sky.

They were underway, setting off on a journey into a life neither had dreamed of but, with a love to rival the stars, it was bound to be a great adventure.
