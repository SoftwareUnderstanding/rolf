CHAPTER 1

If there ever a time for being a fool, its now, and being a fool means acting like a complete moron in front of your friends. I can't help it, I love to be me, and if being me is so wrong, then I'd rather not be me.

I'd rather be a dog, I like dogs.

I'll start this off small, my name is Sean Williams, I'm a Capricorn, I like sunsets when they're red, and I like rainbows, dogs and my job. I'm 24, single, and particularly handsome.

"Gather up, Crew." Cole called.

We were in our safe house; Derek and Ken gathered around Cole at the kitchen table. I stood where I was gazing at Cole. Don't know why, just was.

He looked at me, "Sean, get your ass over here."

My stomach rumbled, my butthole expanded and I let one rip. It was a huge one, awesome. Their eyes went wide and Ken and Derek started laughing.

"I think something just came out of my butthole." I informed.

Cole looked at me, "You can stay over there."

"Sorry...I had beans and it tore my tummy up." I held my nose.

"You got to shit?" Ken asked.

I cocked my head, "Eh."

"Go!" He and Cole both pointed to the bathroom.

I gave a sly look, "Too late."

"Sean, I swear." Derek shook his head.

I laughed, "My bad guys."

"This is serious," Cole informed, "It's about Joey."

"Is he okay?" I asked.

He shifted his stance, "I don't know."

"Where's he at?" Ken questioned.

"Don't know." Cole responded again.

"When's the last time you talked to him?" Derek asked.

"A week ago,"

"No contact since?" I inquired.

He shook his head, "No, I'm worried."

"He couldn't have gotten himself in some shit, I'm sure he's fine." Derek consoled.

"Coming from the man who—"

"You don't have anything on me!" Derek cut my words.

"Au Contraire friend, I do." I smiled.

"Name five." Derek took a step forward.

I held up one finger, "You're black."

He huffed, "Fuck you."

I smiled, "Your names Derek Marty Johnson the third."

"Creepy, how the hell do you know I'm black?"

"You're kidding right?" I cocked my head.

"You racist bastard," He said in a funny voice, it was very...creepy.

"I am not racist!" I protested.

"Yeah," He laughed, "Right."

"Anyways, Joey is missing, in my mind and we have to go look for him." Cole took a couple steps forward.

"Where's the last place you heard from him?" Ken asked.

Cole looked at him, "He said he was headed to Josh's."

"Then that's where we go first." Ken grabbed his jacket from the counter next to him.

"Shotgun," I called.

"Nope," Ken looked at me, "That's mine."

"But—"

"No, let's go." Ken cut me off.

I sighed and followed the rest of them out the front door.
The last time we saw James, Dane and Vern... they took our white van. We needed it to get around, do jobs and shit like that.

If I saw them again, I'd punch them. Not really, I would probably joke around, because if I punched them, they'd kill me, and I like living.

"Let's see what Josh has to say." Cole got out of our new black van.

We followed behind him and approached Josh's work.

Cole stopped, "Sean your coming with me and Derek and Ken wait in the car."

I got excited, I was going with Cole. Usually Ken would go; I would stay behind and fuck with Derek. (Not in that way—Pervert) but I would mess with him, fart and say it wasn't me. (Love the song)

"Cole?" Ken said, "Think about who you're bringing."

"Fuck you!" I blurted.

He came at me and I flinched, "Sorry!"

He snorted and turned back to Cole, "I mean, Sean is a fool, you need someone to help you fuck Josh up."

"Ken, Josh is Joey's older brother, why would we hurt him?" Cole asked.

Ken shrugged, "Okay boss."

"Come on Sean." Cole turned and started towards the police building.

I stuck my tongue out at Ken then ran off, Derek held Ken back as I ran off. I just had to.

"Kenneth is going to kill me when we get back." I told Cole as we went through the front entrance.

He laughed and held open the door for me, "What'd you do?"

I went in front of him and waited, "I gave him the tongue."

He continued forward, "Sean, Ken will literally shoot you so you better be careful with him."

We approached the front desk and I looked at him, "I'm not scared of him."

"Scared of who?" An officer in front of us asked.

We looked at him and faked a laughed; I spoke, "Barney, I'm not scared of Barney."

Cole patted my back, "He's lying; he knows damn well he's scared of Barney."

I raised my eyebrows, "Yeah well that big blob of purple really gets me."

The officer chuckled, "What can I do for you boys?"

Boys? Oh, now it's on...

"Do you got any extra donuts lying around we could have? Or did your fat ass eat them all?" I miffed.

"Excuse me?" The officer's eyes went wide.

"Sean!" Cole got in front of me and pushed me back. He turned back to the officer, "I'm sorry, we're here to see Officer Walker."

The officer snorted, "Right." He turned and walked off.

"Get me a glazed donut while you're at it!" I called.

Cole got in my face, "Are you trying to get us arrested?"

"He called us boys." I protested.

"I don't care! You don't speak to cops like that." He fumed.

"What's up with you man? Why you so soft?" I asked.

He sighed, "Nothing."

I studied him, "Okay, just stop with the... Stuff,"

"And remember, we're here for Joey." He pointed at me.

I held up my hands, "I know."

The fat cop returned with Josh behind him, the cop stopped behind the desk and Josh came out from behind to join us.

I looked at the officer, "Did you bring me my glazed donut?"

He gave me the finger, "Screw you."

"Let's take this outside." Josh suggested.

As we were going back out the front entrance, I turned and winked at the officer.
"What's up?" Josh asked as we stopped out front of the police building.

He was in his police uniform and looking more like a cop by the second, my trigger finger was getting itchy. (Just kidding)

"It's Joey." Cole informed.

Josh's full attention was on Cole, "What happened?"

"To tell you the truth, I don't know." Cole dictated, "We haven't heard from him in a week."

"Did you call him?" Josh asked.

Cole looked at me, "Yeah, about a hundred times, no answer."

"That's not like him." He informed.

Cole nodded, "Have you seen him lately?"

Josh shook his head, "No, not since he came to see me last week. You think something happened to him?"

Cole looked down, "Just need to know where he is."

"I could help." Josh suggested.

"No, no cops." I informed.

He looked at me, "I understand."

Cole placed his hand on Josh's shoulder, "Don't worry, we'll find him."

"I know you will, just please do it before he gets hurt. I can't lose another family member." He groaned sadly.

"You won't." I assured.

He looked at me and smiled, "I know you guys will find him," He sighed, "Hopefully it's before he gets himself in deep with someone dangerous."

"Look we got to go; I'll call you if we find something." Cole held out his hand and Josh took it and they shook.

Josh turned to me and held out his hand for a shake, I refused and brought him in for a hug. We hugged for a second then let go, I like hugs.

He smiled and turned away, walking back into his job. Cole and I went back towards the van, Cole laughed, "Why'd you hug him like that?"

"I like hugs." I informed.

He nodded, "Right."

I hid behind him as we got closer, "Protect me."

"I thought you weren't scared."

"I lied."

He laughed, "He won't do anything."

"Says you!"

We got to the black van and out comes Ken, I hid behind Cole as he came up to us. I prayed he forgot about me, I wasn't that scared.

He had a worried expression on his face and he stopped in front of Cole. Cole looked at him, "What happened?"
We rushed through the hospital doors, coming up to the front desk. Cole was in front, he was the first one to the desk, the first one to talk.

"Joey Walker, we're here to see Joey Walker." He informed the lady.

She checked her computer then looked back up at us, "What was his name?"

"Joey." I urged, "Walker."

She nodded, "He's in room 2B, down the hall to the left."

We nodded, "Thank you." We all started off.

"Hold up!" She called. We turned.

"Only two visitors at a time," She informed.

We looked at her and then at Cole.

"Just kidding," She laughed, "Go on ahead."

We turned and started off again; I stopped and turned, "Not the kidding matter."

She shrugged, "Have a nice day."

I turned and followed behind Ken. We reached Joey's room and a doctor was just coming out, Cole stopped him, "Is he going to be okay?"

"Mr. Walker has been badly beaten, he was shot in his gut, and he got out of surgery an hour ago and is now fully awake. You can speak with him if you like." The doctor informed us.

Derek and Ken entered the room as Cole looked at the doctor, "Thank you."

The doctor smiled and walked away down the hall, Cole looked at me and sighed, "Come on."

We entered the room with Joey and saw what he looked like, I felt bad for him as he was lying there.

His face was bruised and cut, his lip, eyebrow, nose, and forehead was split open. His left eye was bruised and purple, and swelling a bit. His right cheek was bruised as well, it was an upsetting scene.

"Mother fuckers," Cole had to turn away.

I noticed marks around his wrists, bruises it seemed, like the marks were from bonds, I would know, I've been tied up to.

"Joey?" Ken asked in a sweet voice.

Joey's eyes slowly opened and he gave a smile, "Hey."

"You okay?" Derek asked.

Joey shifted himself and flinched in pain, "Yeah, just fucked up is all."

"What happened?" Cole questioned.

He looked at him, "Don't know."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"I mean, I don't remember." He informed.

"I swear." Ken clenched his fists and walked out the room.

I followed behind him as he approached a doctor; he stopped in front of him as he sighed.

"You're his doctor right?" Ken pointed to Joey's room.

The doctor nodded, "Yes."

"Then what the hell happened to him?" Ken demanded.

"He was shot..."

"Yeah, we know, why doesn't he remember what happened?" Ken cut him off.

"Ken." I placed my hand on his shoulder fearing he would punch the doctor.

"We found traces of Rohypnol in his system." The doctor informed.

"What's that?" I asked.

"Roofies," Ken groaned sadly.

The doctor nodded, "Yeah."

Ken rolled his eyes and turned away, walking back into Joey's room. I faced the doctor, "Thank you." I then turned and followed Ken.

"The mother fuckers drugged him." Ken fumed as he got into the room.

"What?" Cole gasped, "With what."

"Roofies," I informed coming in.

"The Date Rape Drug?" Derek asked.

"Are you saying I was raped?" Joey blubbered.

"No." The doctor said coming in.

"So I wasn't raped?" Joey asked.

"No, you were not raped." The doctor answered.

Joey gave a sigh of relief, "Thank god."

"But you were shot so you won't be leaving anytime soon." He informed.

"Don't worry; I won't even get up to go pee." Joey assured rubbing his stomach.

The doctor smiled and turned then jumped out the window, he spread his arms and started to fly. Just kidding, just kidding, he didn't jump out the window, though it would have been funny to see.

But he did leave the room, did not fly but walked. I looked at Joey, "We'll find the people who did this to you."

"That I can promise," Cole looked at him.

"Thanks guys, but you don't have to do that." Joey informed.

"Yeah," Ken took a step forward, "We do."

Joey sighed, "I feel the bad for the people already."

Cole laughed, "That's my boy."

"We better get going." Derek said.

"I'll call Josh, tell him what's up." Cole told Joey.

Joey nodded, "Okay."

"Before we go, Joey, what's the last thing you remember?" Ken asked him.

"I went to go see Kendall at Mid-Atlantis region." He responded.

Cole nodded, "I guess we're going to Mid-Atlantis."

As we were leaving, Joey called Cole and he turned to face him.

"Don't kill him." Joey told him.

Cole huffed, "We'll see."
We came down the street in the black van, Cole was driving and Ken was sitting in the passenger seat next to him, Derek and I were in the back bouncing around like a couple of tennis balls.

Cole would step on the gas, go eighty on the interstate, then brake, which made us fly forward, they thought it was fucking hilarious.

The jokers will get what's coming to them soon, I know we shouldn't be planning this with Joey in the hospital and all, but come on, you'd do the same damn thing.

We pulled up in Mid-Atlantis Region after an hour of laughs and flying forward. By the way, Mid-Atlantis is a casino, a casino where no matter what... You win.

It's the best casino in town, only problem is that when you win, you win not a lot of money. 10 to 20 bucks at a time so you got to play a lot, the slots cost 50 cents and the games are hard, poker and what not.

It was a weird casino, the owner was a silent man, he is not known by many. Those who do know him are assholes, murderers and drug dealers.

"Who are we looking for again?" Derek asked.

"An asshole named Kendall." Ken responded.

"We cannot kill him." Cole informed.

"Awe why not." I sighed.

"Joey told us not to." He said.

"If he's the one who drugged him or shot him then I am." Ken pushed through the doors.

As we went in the inside was amazing, there was a disco ball in the middle of the entire room. There was a bar on the right and the games and slots were on the left, it was beautiful.

"Split up and look for Kendall." Cole ordered.

We split up, Ken went left, Derek went left right, Cole went right left, and I went right. Catch my drift?

I went by the bar to ask the bar tender, as I was headed towards him, a man walking next to me grabbed my arm. I stopped and faced him, wondering what he wanted.

"Your Sean right?" He asked.

"Who's asking?" I answered.

"Bobby, Bobby Adams. You don't know me, but I know you." He informed.

I looked at him then at Cole across the room behind him.

"Come with me, and don't try anything." He demanded.

"So if I try to run, what would you do?" I asked.

"Well," He started, "I'd pull out my pistol and shoot you in the ass, while my friends kill each member of your team."

I was silent, "Okay then, where we going?"

"To see my boss,"

I nodded, "Is he cool?"

"I guess you'll find out huh?" He held out his hand for me to continue ahead.

I proceeded forward looking at Cole who was eyeing Bobby. I gave him the 'Okay' sign and he nodded.

"Like I said, don't try anything." Bobby placed his hand on my shoulder turning me to the right.

We turned into a room, inside was like the hot spot, and there were people inside drinking, playing games and having fun.

We approached a man sitting in a chair on the left side of the room, he was about forty and had long sleek black hair, a 5 o'clock shadow, and in all leather, like he didn't already smell like a biker.

I noticed he had a black leather jacket on, same jacket most of the guys had on, including Bobby. On the back of them it had a symbol and words that said 'The Black Dragons'.

"So you're the Black Dragons?" I turned and asked Bobby.

We stopped in front of the man sitting on the chair and he looked at me and smiled.

"Yes Sean, we are and we know more about you then you think," The man said, "My name is Frankie Adams." He stood up and held out his hand.

I took it and we shook, his hand was surprisingly soft. I looked around, "What is this place like a private room?"

He laughed and sat back down, "Something like that. Have a seat."

His friends pulled out a chair and I took a seat.

"So, Sean, you may know my little brother Bobby." Frankie informed.

I nodded, "We just met."

He smiled, "And I'm sure you already know my other little brother... John."

Someone from behind put me in a choke hold, I struggled to get free in the chair.

"See Sean, I know you and your team killed my little brother, John Adams," Frankie said as his friends tied my hands to the arms of the chair I was sitting in.

"And now you guys are going to pay." He got up, "Next one is you."

His friends finished tying my hands to the chair; they backed off as he approached me.

"You the mother fucker who did that shit to Joey aren't you?" I spat.

He smiled, "Asshole didn't even know what was coming to him."

I tried to get at him, the bonds held me back.

He laughed, "Nice try." He balled his fist and caught me square in the gut.

I coughed in pain and my stomach clenched up, that hurt. He then pulled back and got me in the face, right below my right eye. My cheek bone stung with pain as I looked him in the eye, "You happy?"

"No," He balled his fist again and caught me in the same spot on my face.

I spit, "Fuck you! I hope someone knocks over your bikes!"

"Well that escalated quickly." Bobby said behind me.

I looked down and smiled, "You going to do this in front of your little brother?"

"He's seen worse." Frankie pulled out a pocket knife.

"Oh shit." I thought, "If Cole and them should bust in and save me, I'd like it to be now."

Someone from behind grabbed my head so I wouldn't move. I struggled to get free of the bonds as Frankie came close with the open blade.

"This is for Johnny." He placed the tip of the blade on my left cheek and sliced it open.

I yelled in pain and a hand went around my mouth, shushing me.

"Wouldn't want your team to hear you," Frankie informed.

I said, "Fuck you." But it sounded like, "Bucker – Something."

Frankie laughed then got serious coming closer and slicing open my forehead, I yelled in pain and struggled in the bonds. I wanted to kill him, so fucking bad.

I then got an idea, as Frankie came closer with the blade; I kicked him in the balls then stood up and ran backwards. I hit two people then slammed the back of the wooden chair against the wall.

One chair leg broke off as Bobby came at me, tackled me to the ground and I turned and kicked him in the face. I quickly turned on my belly and got up.

The women in the area screamed and huddled in a corner, like they couldn't bare me escaping but bare me getting sliced open.

As blood dripped down my face struggled to open the door, with my tied hands I reached to open the door but it wasn't enough.

One of the Black Dragons came at me, knocking me back onto the ground, breaking another leg off the chair. As he was on top of me I kept kicking him off, kicking him in the gut, then the chest, then the balls. The kick in the balls worked, he fell to the side crying in pain.

I turned on my belly again and got up, as I went to the door, Frankie got up and aimed his 9mm at me just as Bobby aimed his at me too.

Frankie's face was red as he spoke, "You leave, and its war."

I reached the door knob with my left hand and started to turn it, "It's been war, Frankie."

I opened the door and stepped out and as a hand grabbed my leg, I tripped and fell and broke another leg, which hurt my back.

Bobby came up to me and aimed his 9mm at my face; I looked in its barrel then at his face, his bloody nose.

"Sorry it had to end like this." He said.

People from the casino screamed and ran; I looked to the side and saw Cole with his Desert Eagle pointed at Bobby, about two feet away from me.

"You must be Cole." Bobby guessed.

"And who are you?" Ken asked behind Cole, he and Derek stood there without their weapons.

"Kenneth and let me guess, Derek." Bobby cocked his weapon as it was still aimed at my face.

"Who the hell are you?" Cole asked.

"His name is Bobby Adams." I informed.

Bobby kicked my legs, "Shut up!"

"You wouldn't be related to John Adams would you?" Cole questioned.

Frankie walked in behind Bobby, "Yes, he was our brother."

"Until you killed him!" Bobby fumed.

It was silent, Cole spoke, "Let him go."

Frankie looked down at me, "Leave now and two things... first, its war, we would never be the same."

"We never were friends." I mumbled.

"And second, I'll let all of you guys live this time, and only this time." Frankie finished.

Cole looked at me, "Deal, now go back in that room and we'll leave like nothing ever happened."

"After that?" He asked.

"Its war," Cole cocked his gun.

Frankie smiled and placed his hand on his brothers shoulder, "Let them go, come back in the room."

As Frankie turned Bobby lowered his gun and walked back in the room. I sighed, "I hate those guys."

Cole lowered his gun and came up to me; he helped me up as Ken cut me out of the chair.

"I thought you said it was okay." Cole pointed out.

"Yeah well, I didn't know they were going to punch me and slice me open." I informed.

"We should go." Derek said.

"Aw, but I wanted to play a game." I whined.

"Yeah, let's go." Cole put his gun away and we walked out of the casino.
On the ride home, Cole stopped at a local gas station to pick me up some bandages. As we were headed home, I decided I needed stitches.

"I don't think they're that deep." Derek said looking at my flesh wounds.

"Does he need stitches or not?" Ken asked.

Derek studied me, "Not."

I sighed, "That's good."

"We got to figure out who these people are." Cole made a right turn.

"They're the Black Dragons, a bunch of bikers." I explained.

"You let a bunch of bikers do this shit to you?" Derek asked.

"They're the same people who shot Joey." I informed, "Did you guys ever find Kendall?"

Ken shook his head, "No, he quit last night."

"Are we going to hunt him down?" I asked.

"No, we have what we need; now we got to find out who these Black Dragons are." Cole said.

I nodded and laid back in the back of the van, "I know Bobby and Frankie."

"That emo looking guy is Frankie?" Cole asked looking in the rear view mirror.

"Yeah you know him?"

"No, I just recognize the name. Last name Adams, like John's?"

I nodded, "Yeah man, John's older brother."

"That sucks." Derek sighed.

"And the man is pissed that we killed him." I told them.

Cole made a left turn and parked out front of the safe house. We all got out and started inside.

"I'm going to go make sure Joey's okay, tell him what's up." Cole informed turning back to the van.

"Be careful man." Ken warned.

I unlocked the door and we stepped in as Cole started the van and drove off down the street.As we walked in Ace came up to us to greet us, he jumped on Ken and he pushed him off, he went up to Derek as he and I bent down to pet him.

"He stinks." Ken said.

"Might be your upper lip," I informed him.

He came at me but Derek held him back, "Not worth it."

"Yes it is." Ken balled his fist and swung but I intercepted it and grabbed it, twisting it behind his back.

"Not so fast, fish," I joked.

He broke out of it and turned to face me, "Nice one, now stop fucking around."

Derek sighed and went to sit down on the couch. Ken looked at me then nodded to him and whispered, "What's wrong with grumpy?"

I shrugged, "Maybe it's you."

"I'm serious dude, he's never this upset." Ken looked over at him, "Let's go talk to him."

"Look who's all sympathetic." I smiled.

He gave me a nasty look, "Sean, Derek is your friend."

I looked over at Derek who was laid down on the couch watching television. I could tell something was bothering him, he never watched SpongeBob before.

I looked back at Ken, "Let's go talk to him."

Ken nodded, "Now you're talking."

We looked at each other and I spoke, "You know Derek, I heard you were gay."

Ken smacked me on the back of the head, "Really?"

Derek laughed, "Where'd you hear that?"

"Ken told me." I lied.

"What the bastard means is you seemed bummed out, what's up?" Ken rolled his eyes.

Derek sighed, "It's nothing, family problems."

"Well we're family." I pointed out.

He smiled, "I guess we are. But you don't wanna hear my problems."

"How do you know?" Ken asked.

"Because I don't wanna hear my problems," He informed.

"Just tell us." I urged.

"Fine, my older brother Darrell just got out of Rehab,"

"Why is that a problem?" I asked.

"He has no place to stay and is bugging to stay with me." He continued.

"Why doesn't he stay in the safe house until he's back on his feet?" Ken suggested.

"Eh,"

"It'll be fun."

"You would trust him with all the weapons?" I asked.

"We don't have to tell him where they are." Ken pointed out.

I nodded, "Call him."

"What about Cole?" Derek questioned.

"Right now, I'm the boss," Ken said, "Call him and tell him he can stay here."

Derek sighed, "Whatever." He took out his phone and punched in Darrell's number then placed it against his ear.

"Hey Darrell," Derek greeted in the phone seconds later.

I couldn't hear what was said, he nodded, "Good, listen you still need a place to stay?"

Derek looked at me and made an 'Eek' face, "I have a place by Kolas you could stay in, it's like a safe house for me and the boys."

He rolled his eyes, "No, it is not a porn studio."

I laughed, "El oh el."

Ken shook his head and smiled.

"It's by the Kolas on 6th. The old warehouse." Derek explained on the phone.

He smiled, "See you soon." Then hung up and put his phone back into his pocket.

"How'd it go?" Ken asked in a peppy voice.

"He's coming over in a couple hours." Derek announced.

I nodded, "Cole's gonna be pissed."

"Yeah," Ken agreed, "He's the boss."

Derek laughed, "You assholes."
About an hour later Cole came back to the safe house with some beers, the good kind too. He came in all happy, like we're going to party when there are bikers after us.

That's what I said to, I told him that we shouldn't be partying when there are a gang of bikers after us, and you want to know what he said?

"Those bikers can suck it!"

That's my boss for you, the one man who doesn't care that there are bikers after us, after Joey. I suddenly remembered, I looked at Cole as he crashed down on the couch next to Derek, "Hey did you call Josh?"

"About Joey being in the hospital? Yes." He responded.

"No, about Frankie Adams and his little associate Bobby," I asked.

"Nope, but I'm sure Joey will tell him."

"Because, I'm sure he can do background checks on them." I insisted.

Derek took a beer from the package, "I can do a background check on them,"

"We already know who the hell they are." Ken protested.

"Just saying..." I took a beer from the package and opened it.

"Good thinking, but I doubt we need a background check on the brothers." Cole took a swig of his open beer.

"So... Let's party?" I guessed.

Ken yelled, "YEAH!"

I rolled my eyes, "I'm going to laugh if they come and try to kill us when you're all drunk."

"We are not gonna get drunk." Cole assured.

I looked at him and huffed, "Mm-hm."

About an hour later they were all over the place, I mean you had to see it to believe it. I wasn't drunk, I had a few beers, two to be precise. Cole usually never drinks; I don't know what got into him. Ken and Derek–oh my god,

"Ken! Stop pissing on the couch!"

Ken laughed and raised his beer bottle, "I'm Spider-Man!"

"That makes...No sense!"

"It doesn't have too, I'm hot!" He replied.

"Derek, Derek, put you underwear back on!" I yelled at Derek who was off in a corner looking in his boxers, which were in his hands.

"I saw a spider." He said.

Cole was the worst, I swear, they were on something. He was on the floor acting like a dog; Ace was licking his face and playing tug-of-war with a dirty sock.

"Get off my sock!" I ordered them.

Suddenly Cole came up to me with the sock in his mouth and growled. I looked at him, "You an ugly dog."

He growled and jumped up on me then bit my shirt and pulled it.

"No! Cole! Bad dog!" I pulled it out of his mouth.

I sighed and held my dirty sock in my hand, "Either you guys are on something or this is a really sick joke."

Ken zipped up his pants and came over to me and whispered in my ear, "What if I told you that this is a sick joke."

I looked over at Derek who had a huge smile on his face as he put on his boxers. Good thing his tee shirt covered up his junk, otherwise I would have put acid in my eyes.

I looked over at Cole as he got up wiping his knees and having a smile on his face. I looked at Ken, a blank face, waiting for me to answer his question.

"I'd say you all were a bunch of morons." I responded.

He smiled and looked down, "We are. We're just getting back at you for all those stupid but funny remarks."

I nodded, "And this? This is how you do it?"

He shook his head and looked at me, "No, this is how we say happy twenty fifth birthday bro."

I smiled, "Oh."

"Oh?" Derek asked coming up to us, "That's all you can say is 'Oh'."

"He's speechless." Cole laughed.

"Nah, it's that its one in the morning, couldn't this have waited?"

Ken shook his head and placed his hand on my shoulder, "You're the big two five."

"Christmas is almost here." I pointed out.

Ken reached over and grabbed a beer bottle from the counter and handed it to me, "Here's your present."

I took it and smiled, "So kind of you." I opened it and took a swig.

"Our present is coming in the mail soon." Derek informed.

I nodded, "You didn't have to get me anything."

"Yeah we did." Cole smiled.

"Whose Birthday is it?" A familiar voice said by the front door.

I turned and saw Darrell standing by the front door with three duffel bags.

"Hey." Derek said blankly.

"Don't you all rush to greet me," Darrell said dropping his bags.

"What're you doing here?" Cole asked looking at Derek.

"My little bro said I can crash here for a few, is that okay?" Darrell asked.

Cole looked at him, "Yeah, fine by me. Just wished he'd have told me,"

Darrell nodded and looked around, "Why does it smell like piss?"

Ken laughed and looked down, "Its Sean's birthday."

"Today's the twenty first. That's your B-Day?" He asked looking at me.

I nodded, "Yep."

"Doesn't explain why it smells like piss." He took a step forward.

"I wouldn't sit on that end of the couch." I pointed to the right end of the sofa.

He nodded, "Thanks for the tip."

"I'm going to take Ace for a walk, back in a few." I started toward the front door with Ace next to me.

"No leash?" Darrell asked.

I opened the door and looked at him, "No, he listens."

He nodded, "Good dog."

I smiled and turned, "Yup."

Ace followed me out the door and out onto the sidewalk. He listens, comes when called. Really great dog, he doesn't even need a leash to course him around.

I watched as he sniffed around on the grass looking for a place to shit or pee. I slowly walked with him, watching my steps as I followed him.

My face stung a bit from the slice marks Frankie had given me. The bandages covered up most of the wound.

"Hey Sean," A familiar voice said behind me.

I turned and got hit in the face by something. I stumbled back and saw what it was, a fist.

"I thought you guys lived here." Frankie approached me.

His gang was behind him, Bobby and all.

I stepped back, "Let me guess, you're here to kill me?"

A smile tug at his lip as he took a step toward me, "Not necessarily, I want my brothers killers to suffer."

"Listen Frank, we killed John because he was trying to kill us, and he kind of cut our friends head off, plus he was a complete nut job." I informed.

"That's my bro." He remarked.

I huffed, "Psychopath."

He looked at me, "Get him."

I got in stance, fighting position, like Cole taught me. Two of Frankie's friends came at me, I punched one in the face and back handed the other, they stumbled backward.

Two more stepped up and tried to get at me, I stepped back, "Call them off and I won't go berserk on your ass."

He laughed and crossed his arms, "Nice try."

His friends came at me, one tried to tackle me to the ground but I dodged him and kicked him to the side. The other one stopped and faced me, in stance.

I waved for him to make his move; he smiled and came at me. He kicked and I pushed it away, he punched and I blocked it, then he got a lucky shot on the right side of my ribs. I stepped back, unfazed by the punch.

He stepped back a foot, proud of his success. I looked at him, "Come at me bro."

He smiled evilly, "With pleasure." His voice was high.

He charged and I stepped out of his way in shock. I broke out in laughs, "Oh my god, your voice is so high!"

He crossed his arms and looked at Frankie. I bent over laughing, "I can't breathe!"

He came at me and kicked me in the ribs; I fell to the side in pain. Ace ran up to me and growled at them, teeth showing.

"Cute dog," Frankie pulled out a silenced pistol.

My heart stopped, "No!"

He aimed it at Ace as Ace growled at him; I got up and stepped in front of the barrel, "You shoot him, you shoot me."

"You're really going to take a bullet for a dog?" Frankie cocked the gun.

"Kind of, yeah." I looked him in the eye.

It was a moment of silence; he looked at me while I looked at him. My eyes went from his eyes to the rim of the barrel and back again.

"Make your—"

He pulled the trigger.
My shoulder burned; I yelled out in pain and dropped to the ground.

"Now it's the mutts turn." He lowered his silenced pistol to Ace's face.

"Do that and I kill you," A familiar Russian voice said behind me.

"Why's that?" Frankie asked.

"Because I like dogs, asshole," James Killer informed.

I looked up to see him standing above me with a machine gun aimed at Frankie.

"Who are you?" Frankie lifted the pistol to James.

"James Killer, I knew your brother John." James told him.

"Was he a friend?" Frankie asked.

"Mm, more like an enemy."

They looked at each other, seconds of silence went past before James spoke, "Leave and I won't kill you all with one round."

Frankie looked at the machine gun in James' hand and back at his face, "Okay, okay, okay. We'll go. Come on guys."

They turned and walked back down the street. James snorted and bent down to help me up; he grabbed my arm and pulled me up.

"Thanks man." I told him.

"You okay?"

I nodded, "That guy is an asshole."

"I know, he's lucky I didn't shoot him on the spot, but I couldn't risk giving your save house away to the police."

As we started to the front door I turned and called Ace, "Come on."

He ran past us to the front door and waited until we got there. As we got close I looked at my bloody shoulder, the bullet went right through. I opened the door and all three of us walked inside to the safe house.

"Looks like everyone went to bed." James pointed out.

Darrel was passed out on the couch and the others were probably in their beds in the back.

"Just you and me," I walked in the so-called kitchen to grab the first-aid kit.

"Want me to stitch you up?" He asked.

I took off my tee shirt, "Yeah, let me clean it out first, shit hurts like a bitch." I wiped the wound with a disinfectant cloth.

He nodded.

When I finished up the bullet entrance wound, I looked over at James, "Can you do the exit wound?"

He approached me, "Sure."

I handed him the cloth and he took it then started dabbing the outside of the wound. I cringed in pain, "Ouchy."

"Done," He threw the bloody cloth in the trash, "Want me to stitch it?"

"Yeah, the stitches are in there." I pointed to the first-aid kit.

He nodded and reached in and grabbed them. As he started to stitch them I started to make up small conversation, "So, why are you here?"

"What a friend can't drop by to say hello?" He asked.

"How'd you know where we were?"

"Damn you ask a lot of questions," He said, "Joey told me what was up, told me to check on you guys."

"We can handle ourselves." I informed.

"I just saved your life and this is how you repay me?"

"Well, you did take our van."

He laughed, "Oh yeah, why didn't you come take it back?"

"We got a new one, black." I informed.

"Blacks the new white," He laughed, "Hand me the scissors."

I reached over and grabbed the scissors then handed them to him.

"Thank you." He took them.

"How have you been?" I asked.

He huffed, "I've been good."

"Anything new?"

"Got a place up in Bear,"

"That's good, with the wife?" I asked.

"Nah, with Dane,"

I nodded, "That's nice." I had to resist the urge to laugh.

"Done here, turn around so I can do the entry wound." James told me.

I stood up and flipped the chair facing James and then I sat. He soon began stitching it up.

"How is the Crew doing?" He asked.

"Good, other than a crazy biker gang is after us and Joey being in the hospital." I informed.

"That's why I'm here."

I smiled, "Thanks man."

"Woman," He corrected.

"What?"

He laughed, "Just joshing you."

I nodded, "Right."

"Have you seen Vern lately?" He asked.

"No, haven't seen any of you guys since you three took our van,"

He laughed, "I still think that's funny."

I shrugged, "Oh well."

"Might just take the new van." He murmured.

I laughed, "Good luck."

He smiled, "Just kidding."

I raised one eyebrow, "Were you?"

He shook his head and I laughed. Darrel moaned and turned over on the couch, "Shut it Jose, I'm trying to sleep."

We looked at him, "Jose?"

"Probably his cell mate." I guessed.

James picked up the scissors and cut the remaining stitch that hung off my wound; he unwrapped a bandage and placed it over the wound like he did the other.

"All done," He stated.

I got up and wiped myself off, "Thanks man it feels a better. Still hurts like a bitch."

He laughed, "Anytime."

"Well I'm pooped." I looked at the clock, 3:38am, "You can make a bed on the floor or take up that space on the couch."

James nodded, "I'll take the couch."

I nodded, "Okay."

I started in the back where there was an empty bed waiting for me. I passed the other rooms, there were three rooms, and we each had to share a bed if we were going to stay here.

I went in the second room where Derek was sleeping in, I got in the bed as something dirty passed my mind. I held back a laugh and laid next to him.

"This is so gay." He mumbled.

I laughed and closed my eyes then suddenly remembered something; James was sleeping in pee.
I awoke to the sound of yelling. I looked next to me and Derek wasn't there; I got up.

"How many times do I have to tell you?" Cole yelled, "I don't care who you think you are! It's who you really are!"

I walked out into the kitchen. Cole, Derek, Ken and James were standing on the right side of Bobby Adams pointing their pistols at him while his hands were raised.

"I'm done Cole!" Bobby yelled, "Done with the life of being a servant of my brother!"

Cole moved the gun as he spoke, "We don't want your shit here!"

"Why won't you let us be cool?" Bobby asked, "I'll tell you all you need to know!"

"Fuck that!" Cole cocked his silenced gun.

"Wait! Wait! Please Cole! I'll do anything!" He cried.

"Cole!" I called.

He looked at me and I spoke, "Not on my birthday."

He looked back at Bobby, "Sean, what's beneath that bandage?"

I looked at him, "What?"

"Just answer the question."

"A bullet wound." I responded.

He nodded still looking at Bobby, "And who shot you?"

"Frankie."

"Yeah, your brother shot my friend on his birthday. Like I'm going to let you walk away."

I rolled my eyes and looked at Bobby who turned and looked at me; he opened his mouth and spoke, "Happy birthday."

I nodded as Cole lowered his gun and approached him. He motioned with his gun for Bobby to move forward, he moved towards me as I moved out the way.

As he was passing me he looked at me and mumbled, "Can't always trust the people you call friends."

Cole took him to the first room, Ken followed behind them with a chair and duct tape. I turned and looked at James, "What happened?"

He put his pistol in his pants, "He wanted to join the Crew."

"Or be cool with us." Derek added.

I nodded, "Where's your brother?"

James laughed.

"He went out for a breather." Derek said.

"What happened?" I asked.

"I got on his nerves." James answered.

"And I missed it?" I whined.

"It was funny." He laughed.

Cole came out of the back, "You okay?"

I nodded, "Yeah."

He walked into the kitchen, "You should have woken me up, it could have been worse."

"I'm fine." I informed.

He sighed, "Okay."

"Good thing James was there," I said, "Frankie would have killed me on the spot."

James looked at me, "It was a pleasure; after all, we did work together."

I nodded, "Thanks again bro."

"I'm going to go check on Joey." Cole grabbed his coat.

"I'm coming along." I said grabbing my shirt and coat off a chair.

While we were walking out of the front door, I slipped my shirt on and threw my coat around myself. We got in the black van, started it and drove off down the street.

"I'm wondering how Frankie knew where our safe house was." Cole said as he drove down the street.

I shrugged, "Google?"

He laughed, "You can Google anything nowadays."

"I once Googled myself and guess what popped up?"

"Shit?"

I faked a laugh, "Ha! No. You fish."

He smiled, "And to think I thought you lost all your childish acts."

I rolled my eyes, "No, I didn't lose them; they just dimmed a bit after I was shot."

He turned a corner, "I still wish you would have woken me up."

"And said what Cole? Hey, I've been shot wake the hell up?"

"Yes! Something like that would have sufficed." He sighed, "I mean, you didn't even try to wake me up, what if James wasn't there."

"I would have handled it myself." I told him, "I don't have to get you guys involved, Frankie tried to kill me, not you guys."

"Someday he will try to kill someone else; his focus is not only on you." Cole turned left.

I sighed and looked out the window, "I know."

"We as a team have to work together on this, now we have James to worry about." He continued, "And I don't want anyone else to end up in the hospital like Joey."

He stopped at a red light, "We're a team even if anyone likes it or not."

I smiled, "The Crew is true."

He looked at me and held up his fist, "For real though."

I brofisted him and looked down, "That was so corny."

He laughed and nodded, "I know right."

The light changed and we speed off.
"I wonder what Joey's doing." I said as we were in the elevator going up to Joey's room.

"He's probably flirting with the nurses." Cole informed.

I laughed, "Nah, he's old school."

"Pssh, wanna bet on it?"

I looked at him, "Fifty bucks."

He held out his hand, "Deal."

I took it and we shook, closing the deal. The elevator stopped and the doors opened and we stepped out. We approached Joey's room, nodding to the woman who sat at the desk.

We stopped at Joey's room and he was with a female nurse. He was lying in bed while she fixed his pillow.

"You know I like it when you do that." He told her, "Fluff it up."

I looked at Cole who winked, "Told you."

"Hey, where you going baby?" Joey asked the nurse as she was walking out the door.

She turned, "Very funny Mr. Walker, bye."

Joey laughed, "I like her."

I reached in my pocket and took out my wallet, opening it and grabbing a fifty then handing it to Cole.

"What was that for?" Joey asked looking at us.

I closed my wallet and put it away, "For being a dick."

I approached him and we shook hands, "What's good man?"

"Nothing, just bored." He responded.

I nodded and sat on the chair next to him as he sat up. He looked at Cole who had a smile on his face as he put the fifty away.

"What's going on?" He asked.

"Nothing," Cole responded, "Why would there be something wrong?"

"I don't know," Joey said, "You sure?"

"Well apart from Sean getting shot and Bobby wanting to bring peace, things have been fine." Cole informed.

Joey nodded and looked at me, "You got shot on your birthday?"

"Yeah, Frankie, you heard of him?" I asked.

He nodded, "Yeah, Cole told me last time he was here."

"The bastard shot me." I explained, "Almost shot Ace."

"What?" Joey gasped.

I nodded, "Yeah, thanks for calling James, he came just in time."

He smiled and looked back at Cole, "I'm hungry."

"I'll get you a little something at the vending machine." I offered standing up.

He looked at me, "Thanks man."

I walked by the door, "Whatcha want?"

He thought about it, "Anything."

I nodded, "Okay." I walked out the door and looked around for a 'snack-machine'.

One caught my eye to the right, I proceeded towards it. I reached in my pocket and grabbed my wallet, opened it and took out two ones.

I closed my wallet and stuffed it back into my pants then looked inside the machine for something good. Something caught my eye, a smooth chocolate bar with almonds. Yes.

I put a dollar in and pressed B4, seconds later the candy bar fell. I put the other dollar in the machine and got the same thing for Joey.

"Think fast!" A hand turned me around and slammed me against the wall by my neck.

The man took out a blade and held it in my face, "Frankie sends his greetings."

I smacked the blade out of his hand then caught him in his jaw with a right hook, kicked him back then punched him with my left fist in the face as hard as I could.

He dropped to the ground like a rock. I looked up to see about six guys in leather jackets staring at me. They took out guns and as I dived to the side they let shots off.

I got up against the wall. Joey and Cole were two rooms away; I had to go to them so we could escape together.

"Sean!" Cole yelled from the room.

Shots were still going off, lights were busted and nurses were screaming.

"I'm okay!" I yelled back.

The light above me broke and sparks flew. I looked around for something I could use to make a distraction so I could get with Cole and Joey. We had to escape. The shots stopped as they were reloading their weapons.

Quick Sean!" Cole yelled.

But I was ahead of him, already running towards him. I got in the room and shut the door behind me.

"Where'd they come from?" Joey asked.

He was still lying in bed.

"I don't know but we have to get out of here." Cole looked out the window, "Could we jump?"

I shook my head, "Nah, too high."

Joey sat up, "I got a plan."

"Can you walk?" I asked him.

He looked at me and nodded, "Yeah and the plan? Is to run like hell,"

"Why don't we just wait until they run out of bullets?" I suggested.

"Yeah like they're gonna keep shooting at nothing." Cole walked to the door, "They stopped."

"Maybe their gone?" I looked at him.

He shook his head, "No."

Joey stood up, "Let's go."

"What?" My eyes went wide, "Let's just wait them out."

Joey came up to me, "Wait and get shot, we can run."

"Run where?" I asked.

He shrugged, "I don't know, to the right?"

"To the vending machine?" I suddenly remembered my candy bars, "Let me through!"

I ran to the door but Cole was blocking it.

"Where are you going at a time like this?" He asked.

I turned the knob, "I forgot my candy." Twisting it, I opened the door and ran out into the hall.

"There he is!" A deep voice yelled from down the hall.

I ran to the right and hid behind the wall again as shots went off. The wall was hit but no bullets came through. I had to think of a plan to rescue my candy bars.

They were in great danger, even though the vending machine was shot to hell.

"Hey Sean!" A familiar voice called down the hall.

"Is that Frankie?" I asked.

"No, my name is Marshall" He said.

I laughed, "Like Marshall Mathers?"

His friends laughed.

"No, like Marshall Unifrance." He corrected.

I laughed again, "Your last name is Unifrance?"

"It's a family name."

I nodded, "Right."

"Anyway, I'm here to kill you. Frankie sent me and the boys to eliminate you like you eliminated John Adams."

"Hey Cole!" I called.

"Yeah?" He responded.

"You hear that?"

"Yeah,"

"He's here to kill us!" I laughed.

"Good luck Mr. Unicorn!" Cole yelled.

I laughed, "El oh el."

Shots went off.

"You do realize you're shooting at nothing!?" I pointed out.

The shots stopped.

"You have to wait until we come out!" I informed.

"Hey Sean!" Marshall called.

"Yeah?"

"You wanna play Peek-a-boo?" He asked, "All you have to do is stick your head out from behind the wall and then pull it back when I shoot."

"I JUST WANT MY CANDY BARS!" I bellowed.

"I'll let you get your candy." Marshall said.

"Really?"

"Yeah." He said, "You have five seconds before I shoot."

I rolled my eyes, "Really?"

"One,"

I got ready to run.

"Two,"

I ran to the vending machine and reached in then grabbed the two candy bars.

"Four! Five!"

As I pulled them out and darted to the side, shots went off. I leaned against the wall and they stopped.

"You cheated!" I yelled.

"Pssh, I did not!" He responded.

"Did too!" Cole sympathized.

"Ha!" I spit.

"Sean?" Cole yelled.

"Yes Boss?"

"Can you make it back?"

I peeked out from behind the wall and saw Marshall and about six guys by the elevator with large machine guns. I pulled my head back, "Yeah."

I darted out from behind the wall with my candy bars and ran into Joey's room, only to stick my head out and give the tongue to Marshall and his partials.

"You okay?" Cole asked.

I held up my candy bars and sung, "I got my candy!"

He laughed and shook his head.

"Hey, let me get one." Joey held out his hand as I tossed him one.

"How are we going to get out of here?" Joey asked.

I took out my phone, "Leave it to me! I know some people."

I pressed in a number and it rang as I held it to my ear.

"Hello?"

"Hey my friend, we need some backup." I said.

"Where are you?"

"The hospital." I informed.

"Be there as soon as I can."

I smiled, "Thanks." I hung up and put my phone away.

"My backup is on its way." I opened my candy bar and took a bite.

"Who's coming?" Joey asked.

"You'll see." I said with my mouth full of chocolate.

"Until then?" Cole asked.

"We could play I-Spy?" I suggested.

"Um, let's just fuck with Marshall." Cole said.

I nodded, "Even better." I walked to the door, "Hey Marshall, you still there?"

"Yeah, I'm here!" He yelled.

"Good because I want to tell you something."

"What's that?" He asked.

"I think I love you."

It was silent, "Really?"

"Yeah," I lied.

"How about we put the guns down and talk face to face?" He suggested.

I looked at Cole and he shook his head.

"Nah, let's just do it the hard way!" I yelled.

"If you say," Shots went off.

Bullets hit the door and the glass broke into pieces.

"Nice shot, but you still didn't shoot any of us!" I called.

The shots stopped and it was silent. I heard whispering and looked at Cole, "I wonder what they're whispering about."

"Your mom!" Marshall yelled.

I laughed, "Funny guy!"

"You really want to see how funny I can be?" He added.

"What are you secretly a clown?" I asked.

"Come out here and I'll show you!"

I shook my head.

"You know he can't see that." Joey pointed out.

I nodded and he rolled his eyes.

"When is your backup coming?" Cole asked.

"Any minute," I informed.

He nodded, "Hope we don't die in the meantime."

Bullets were shot and people started yelling, screaming and shouting. We looked at each other in confusion.

"My people are here." I smiled.

There were gun shots and then everything got quiet.

"Okay, people are dead now." A familiar voice said from down the hall.

Cole opened the door and looked at me, "You called Derek?"

"My backup," I nodded going out into the hall.

Derek, James and Ken approached us, pistols in their hands. I noticed James holding his side, he had been shot.

"You alright?" I asked him.

He nodded, "Flesh wound."

I looked at him, "You sure?"

"Yeah," He nodded.

I looked down the hall to the pile of dead bodies; it looked like they ambushed them. I looked around for Marshall's body, I couldn't find it.

I looked at Ken, "Did some escape?"

He shook his head, "No, that's all of them."

As we walked to the elevator I looked around for his dead body, still wasn't there.

"Marshall, you slick dog you." I said as the elevator doors shut closed.
Back at the safe house we all sat around while Cole stitched James up. Like he said, it was a flesh wound. I sat on the couch cleaning my pistol; I took it apart and wiped it with a dry cloth.

It was quiet as Derek and Darrell sat on the couch next to me watching television.

"Is that a real gun?" Darrell asked me.

I looked at Derek behind him and he shook his head.

"No, it's an Airsoft gun." I informed.

He nodded, "Thought so."

I laughed.

"What?" He questioned.

I shook my head, "Nothing."

"There's nothing on TV." Derek threw the remote on the table in front of him.

"Shouldn't we be making a plan to get Frankie and the gay dragons?" James asked.

"I don't know." Cole admitted.

"So, we're just going to sit around and smell our fingers?" James looked at me.

I put my hand down.

"Yeah, I mean, let's make up a plan." Cole took out a piece of paper and a pen from the kitchen table, "What should we do?"

"I think we should set a trap." I put out.

"That's a good idea." Ken stood up straight, "And I got just the thing."

"Wait, wait, wait, why don't we just talk to them, tell them that we don't want any trouble and we want peace." Joey said.

"Joey," I started, "We have his little brother."

"What?"

"Oh yeah, I forgot he was back there." Cole laughed.

"You took his brother?" Joey asked.

I shrugged, "Fifty. Fifty."

"What does that mean?"

"Yes and no." Derek added.

Joey looked at him blankly, "Still, what does that mean?"

"It means, he came here and we tied him to a chair, we didn't take him." Cole explained.

Joey nodded, "What have I missed?"

"A lot," I laughed.

He smiled, "Just like The Crew."

"The Crew is true, man." I smiled.

He nodded, "That's a nice rhyme. Did you come up with that yourself?"

I shrugged, "I try."

"Hey guys, check this out." Derek turned the TV up.

The news blared with an important update:

"I'm standing out front of Mid-Atlantis Region where just a minute ago, the casino was on fire. Officials aren't saying much about how the fire was started but it ended with a message to someone unidentified,"

The camera changed to the inside of the burnt casino, on the wall there were words written in white paint that said, 'You'll All Pay!'

"It is still unknown on exactly how many people died in the fire, but it is concluded that the owner Frankie Adams, the leader of The Black Dragon motorcycle gang, is nowhere to be found. We'll have more news soon."

Joey shut the TV off, "You burned down the casino?"

"No, we didn't." Cole informed.

"Then how do you explain that? Frankie didn't torch his own place." He looked at us.

"He knows we have his brother." I sighed.

"Now it's not even war, it's personal." Derek said.

"At least we know he's coming for us." James informed, "Now we can prepare."

"What are you guys talking about?" Darrell asked sitting up.

I looked at Derek, "You have to tell him, or he has to leave. Your call,"

He sighed, "Darrell, can I talk to you in the back?"

Darrell nodded, "Sure baby bro."

They got up and walked into the second room together. James looked at each of us, "He doesn't know?"

Cole shook his head, "No, Derek didn't want him to know."

James nodded, "It's better to not tell."

I sighed, "So... Are we gonna make a plan?"

"Yeah," Cole said, "We have to find out their moves before they move."

"How do we do that?" Joey asked.

"Their bikers, I'm sure it's not that hard." Ken laughed.

"Karma," I said.

"Oh," He said blankly.

"We could study them, watch everything they do." Joey suggested.

"Stalk them." I pointed out.

He laughed, "Yeah, kind of."

"But, like that bitch on the TV said, we don't know where he is." Ken picked at his nails with a blade.

"We could ask Bobby." Cole said.

I nodded and stood up, "I can."

"Go for it, just don't untie him." Cole ordered.

I walked towards the room, "I won't."

As I entered the room Bobby looked at me, he couldn't talk because of duck-tape over his mouth. I smiled, "Aye, mate."

He gave me a nasty look.

"What's that for?" I asked sitting in the chair in front of him, "I didn't do anything to you."

He looked away as I ripped the tape off of his mouth, "Ah! Fuck!"

"That's better." I smiled.

"What do you want?" He asked.

"We're looking for your brother,"

"Good luck." He spit.

I flicked him in the nose.

"What the hell was that for?" He yelled.

I flicked him again, "Stop being mean!"

"What! I'm not!"

I flicked him again.

"WOULD YOU STOP FLICKING ME?!" He bellowed.

I laughed, "No."

"Sean?" Cole called with a worried tone.

"It's alright." I informed him. I looked at Bobby, "We're alright, right?"

He nodded, "I hope."

"So, how about telling me where we could find Frankie?" I looked him in the eyes.

He sighed, "He might be at his beach house in Rehoboth."

I flicked him in the nose, "Wait, what?"

He nodded, "Yeah, he has a beach house down Rehoboth."

I put my hand down, "Thanks for your cooperation."

He smiled, "Can you let me g—"

I re-duck-taped his mouth shut and walked out.

"So, what did the prisoner have to say?" Ken asked as I walked up to him, Joey and Cole.

"Frankie has a beach house down Rehoboth." I informed.

Cole nodded and looked at James and Derek as him and Darrell came out of the room, "I guess we're going to the beach."

"Picture this, guys!" James said, "We, as a team, defeat the bad guys. We kill them all, and then have our victory dance. Which goes like this," He started to do the robot.

I laughed, "Nice Play-By-Play."

He nodded, "Right though?"

"Yeah, but how do we defeat the bad guys?" Joey asked.

"Like this." James took out his silenced pistol and shot an empty beer glass on the counter.

I looked over at Derek, he had his head in his hands and he looked upset. Darrell was across from him; he was sitting awkwardly and looking at everyone for a second.

I placed my hand on Derek's shoulder, "Can I speak to you outside?"

Without putting his head up, he nodded. As I got up from the couch, he followed me out the front door.

"What's up?" He asked looking down.

"You okay?"

He nodded, "Yeah."

"You sure? Because you don't look okay," I informed.

He sighed, "It's just that I had to tell my older brother that I killed people for a living. How would you feel?"

I huffed, "I don't know, I don't have a brother."

"Your sister?"

"Nope, only child," I corrected.

"Well, whatever! How do you think I feel?" He yelled and turned.

I sighed, "Derek, you're my best friend and I hate to see you like this. What can I do to make it better?"

"Nothing, you can leave me alone!" He started off up the street.

"Fine go! Runaway from your problems like you always have!" I yelled at him.

He turned then came at me and got in my face, "Sean! I don't want to hear your crap! Stay out of my life!"

"Then why don't you handle your own life!? Damn man, your problems are so high they're leaking out all over the place! Clean them up for once!"

He balled his fist and sucker punched me in the face with his left fist, then again with the right. I stumbled backwards and lost my balance. He punched me again in the face, then again.

I fell backwards as blood came out my mouth, I hit the hard ground and he stood above me punching me in the same place.

He soon stopped and my face stung with pain. He backed away, "It's never going to be the same between us."

He turned and walked off.

I wiped the blood from my mouth and got up, "This doesn't change anything!"

I spit blood and shook my head as I walked up to the front door. I opened the door and walked inside.

"What the hell happened?" Cole asked as he came up to me.

I shut the door behind me and shook my head, "Just had a nice little talk."

"And he beat the crap out of you." Ken laughed.

I looked at him fumed, "Ken! Not now!"

He held up his hands, "Sorry."

James handed me a wet cloth, "Here,"

I took it and dabbed my bottom lip with it. It stung as I touched it.

"What happened out there?" Cole asked.

I sighed, "He punched me again, and again, and a fucking again. The bastard, but I don't blame him."

"Where'd he go?" Ken asked.

"I don't know, but we need to find him." I informed wiping my cheek bone with the wet cloth.

"Frankie." James suggested.

I nodded, "Yeah, he might find him."

Darrell got up from the couch, "Let's go then."

I threw the cloth on the counter and turned to the front door, "We're all going?"

Cole shrugged, "Why not, we have to all talk to him."

I nodded and opened the front door, "Alright."

I stepped out and stopped out front then pointed to the left, "He went that way."

We all exited the safe house and James closed the door behind us. I started up the street, "I'm first."

Darrell followed behind me and we all proceeded in a line down the street. I looked around for Derek; people walked past us on the sidewalk, I tried not to make eye-contact with anyone but it was difficult because everyone seemed to be looking at me.

I pushed awkwardly against the flow with my friend's right behind me. People cleared the sidewalk and I soon saw a familiar face.

"There he is." I said and went to him, "Derek!"

"Sean, leave me alone!" He yelled.

I stopped in front of him, "What're you going to punch me again?"

Everyone stopped behind him.

"Come on man, do it." I intimidated.

He sighed, "No."

"Look man, I'm sorry for saying that." I informed, "Come back to the safe house."

He shook his head and walked away. I groaned and held out my hand for everyone to stay here and followed Derek as he turned the corner.

"Remember that job in Vegas we did?" I asked walking behind him, "The time I got caught by Henry and he fucked me up for not telling him anything about us, when you guys came to the rescue I cried my eyes out, you were there, you cried with me. Do you remember what you said to me?"

I ran up and stopped in front of him then faced him, "Do you remember what you said to me?"

He sighed, "I told you that throughout it all, we'd always be tight. Even when the monsters try to pull us apart,"

I nodded, "And guess what I'm telling you."

He smiled, "I guess I never did understand the true value of friendship."

I laughed, "Throughout it all, man."

He held out his hand and I took it and we brought a hand shake in to a best friend hug.

"Can we go now?" I asked.

He nodded and as we turned to leave a white van pulled to a stop next to us, the side opened and inside stood four guys in ski masks.

We froze and Derek looked at me, "Shit Sean, run!"

Before we could run around the corner, they jumped out of the van and grabbed me.

They threw Derek against the wall and punched him in the face a few times while they dragged me inside of the van.

An arm went around my neck and I was soon held in a choke hold. Struggling to get free, I elbowed the guy who had me in the gut. His grip loosened but he didn't let go.

"Sean!" Cole yelled.

I saw him and the others running towards the van as it pulled away with me in the back. The side door closed shut and everything was dark.

Something hit me in the face and I blacked out.
I awoke seeing blackness, there was something covering my eyes. I was undoubtedly tied to a chair and there was tape over my mouth.

I had been kidnapped, if that's a good word to describe it. Or shall I say adultnapped.

It was quiet, I was sure I was alone. Unsure of where I was being kept, I could be anywhere. My head hurt and I was sure of one thing, I was bleeding.

I heard footsteps approaching then they stopped in front of me. I looked up to still see blackness, but I thought I'd see if I could see anything. Nothing.

"Do you recognize my voice?" A man asked.

I didn't know if they could see me, I couldn't speak or see. But I could nod and shake my head. And I did, I shook my head.

"Guess." He ripped the tape from over my mouth.

I licked my lips, "The Old guessing game huh? Well let's see, you sound like your white. About mid-thirties, by the sound of your voice I can tell you mean business... You're Batman!"

He punched me in the face and I laughed, "No?"

"Try again." He spit.

I nodded and thought about it, "You're not Marshall, I know his voice. You could be John or Frankie or Bobby, but I know they're voices as well. That leaves no suspects, would you like me to guess?"

"I'll give you a hint... We met in Vegas, you tried to kill me."

I froze, "We killed you."

"You ever heard of a clone?" Henry asked.

"You made a clone of yourself?"

He laughed, "No, just made someone look like me."

"What do you want?" I quaked.

He ripped the blind fold off my eyes, "I want you to suffer. Again,"

The light burned my eyes; I squinted and looked up at his face. Memories swirled inside my mind, the scars hurt from the thought of what he did to me in Vegas.

"What did I ever do to you?" I looked at him.

He right hooked me in the face, "What's the matter? Don't you remember?"

I spit, "I don't even remember what I had for dinner last night."

He smiled, "You're still as stubborn as were in Vegas."

"And you're still as ugly as you were in Vegas."

He laughed then punched me in the face again, "Don't fuck with me!"

I licked my top lip; it was numb from the pain. I looked up to the ceiling; I had no idea where I was. The ceiling was about twelve to fourteen feet away from where I was sitting.

I looked next to me, there were boxes stacked to the top. I looked to the other side of me, there was a door, and boxes around it.

"Trying to figure out an escape route?" Henry asked bending down in front of me.

I looked at him, "No, trying to figure out where the hell I am."

He nodded, "Understandable."

"So, are you going to tell me?"

He looked at me and smiled, "No."

I nodded, "Understandable."

Henry stood up and walked to a table behind him; he grabbed a scalpel and scissors then approached me.

"And now it's time I make you my bitch." He smiled.

I shifted in the chair and struggled to get out of the bonds, not again, this cannot happen again.

"Oh don't worry, it won't hurt a bit." He informed.

He put the scalpel in his mouth and lifted my shirt up then started cutting my shirt in half.

"You're not going to rape me are you?" I asked.

He finished cutting my shirt and my chest was revealed.

He took the scalpel out of his mouth, "No, but it looks like someone already cut you on your face so this spots mine."

"Why is everyone trying to kill me?" I yelled.

"Because you are a dick," He threw the scissors onto the ground, "Don't move."

As he bent down in front of me, I struggled to get out of the bonds. My feet were tied to the chair and my hands were taped to the sides of it.

He pressed the scalpel against my chest and cut a line down the middle. I yelled in pain and he laughed, "Hurts?"

I huffed and cringed in pain, "No shit Sherlock."

"This is fun," He pointed to the scar on my side, "I remember that."

"Brings back some bad memories," I added.

He nodded, "To you, for me, it was fun."

I shook my head, "You're a sick fuck."

"Why thank you!"

"It wasn't a complement." I mumbled.

He placed the scalpel on a different spot that wasn't cut; he then pressed it so that it broke skin.

I cringed in pain and looked away, "I'm starting to fucking hate you even more!"

"And to think, I came all the way from Vegas to fuck you up again." He smiled and backed away.

"You never did answer me," I said, "What did I do to make you so pissed at me?"

He looked at me, "You really don't know?"

I shook my head, "No. but I remember what you did to me in Vegas."

He put the scalpel back and turned away, "Your brother."

"I don't have a brother." I informed.

He nodded and turned to me, "Yeah you do, his name is Felix Gulber."

"I don't think he's my brother, we don't have the same last name."

"You don't have to have the same last name to be related dumbass." He approached me, "Your brother killed my best friend."

"What's that have to do with me?" I asked.

He lifted my head up, "You're his brother right?"

I shrugged, "I don't know."

"His little brother has to pay." He sung then turned away, "But, you know. I'm going to use you as bait."

I nodded, "I knew it, you know I never met my brother, what's he like?"

He faced me, "Like you. An ass,"

I smiled, "That's my bro."

Henry picked up the scalpel and slowly walked towards me, "Yeah, and that's why I don't like you very much."

The door opened next to me and quickly shut, a man stood there with a silenced pistol aimed at Henry as he froze with the scalpel in his hand.

"But you didn't even get to know him." The man said in a British accent.

Henry smiled, "Ah, Felix. Perfect timing,"

I looked over at my so-called brother; he looked kind of like me, 5 o'clock shadow and shortish black hair. Only thing is, he sounded British.

"Why are you doing this Henry?" Felix asked.

"You know why asshole, you killed William!" Henry yelled at him.

"Hello, I'm still tied to the chair here." I informed.

Henry looked at me, "Shut up!"

"Hey!" Felix yelled, "Don't tell him to shut up!"

He looked at him, "Protective aren't we?"

"You can say that." Felix lifted his silenced pistol at Henry, "Or you can say that I'm a good brother."

Henry lifted the scalpel to him, "You going to shoot me?"

Felix tilted his head to the right, "Yes and no." He lowered the gun and shot him in the leg.

Henry fell to the ground yelling pain, grabbing his leg and cursing. Felix lowered the gun to his side and took out a blade and came up behind me. He cut my bonds and tape around my arms and waist.

I bent down and untied the bonds around my ankles and then I stood up and faced him.

He smiled and held out his arms, "Bro."
Felix and I knocked Henry out and dragged his unconscious body to Felix's car that was parked out front of the building I was in.

We put him in the back and got inside of the blue car. As I painfully put my seatbelt on, I looked around.

"Nice car." I told him.

He smiled and buckled up, "Thanks."

"So you say you're my brother?" I asked.

He started the car, "Yeah, we have the same parents."

I nodded, "Then what's with the accent?"

He backed up, "I was born in the United States but raised in England."

"And that makes you get a British accent?"

He pulled off down the road, "I kind of worked for it; it wasn't so good being the only kid in England with an English accent."

I nodded and he turned to me and nodded at my chest, "He do that?"

I looked down at the blood and the slice wounds on my chest and nodded, "Yeah."

He looked at my face, "What about that?"

"Nope, a biker did." I informed.

"Frankie Adams?" He guessed.

I looked at him, "Yeah, how did you know?"

"I know him, that son of a bitch did that to you?"

I nodded, "He's after me and my friends."

"Cole Phillips and them?"

"Yeah, how do you know these things?"

He laughed and turned right, "You know."

I gave a blank look, "No. I don't know. You know!"

He smiled, "It just comes naturally."

I nodded, "Aren't we noble?"

"What?"

"Nothing,"

He nodded, "You mad at me?"

I shook my head, "No, why?"

"You sound mad."

"I'm not."

"Are you sure?" He asked.

I nodded, "Should I be mad?"

He was silent.

I looked at him, "Felix. Should I be mad?"

"A little bit." He responded dully.

"Why?"

He sighed, "Dad took me and left when you were less than a year old. I was four at the time."

I looked down and nodded, "I know, mom told me dad left, but she didn't mention you."

He stopped at a red light and reached in the back then pulled out a tee shirt. He handed it to me, "Here, put this on."

I took the shirt and opened it up, I laughed, "I make my girl scream louder than when she's on a rollercoaster. Really man?"

He smiled, "Put the shit on."

I unbuckled the seatbelt and slowly took it away from my chest, "You sure?"

"Yeah why?"

"The blood," I informed.

He nodded, "Its fine."

I pulled the shirt over my head and put it on; it stung the slice wound as I moved. I cringed in pain as I put the seatbelt back on.

"What's the matter?" Felix asked as the light changed.

"Nothing," I informed.

He sped off to the right, "Yes, something is wrong. What is it?"

"Shirt hurts."

"Take it off."

I shook my head, "Its fine."

He looked at me, "You sure?"

I nodded, "Yeah. I've been in worse pain before. Trust me."

"Okay."

"Where we going anyway?" I asked.

"To my safe house," He informed.

I nodded, "Where's that?"

"Right here," He turned into an alley.

He pulled to a stop and turned the car off then unbuckled his seatbelt.

"Help me haul his ass inside." He said getting out.

I undid my seatbelt and got out as well. We opened the back door and dragged Henry's motionless body into his safe house.

"Let's tie him to that chair." Felix nodded to the chair in front of us.

We placed him on the chair and Felix held him up, "Hand me the gorilla tape in there." He pointed to the first cabinet in the kitchen.

I walked over and got the tape then brought it back to him. He taped Henry's hands to the sides of the chair then taped his legs to the bottom.

He ripped the tape with his mouth, cutting it off after he taped his limb to the parts of the chair. He threw the tape away from him and then started to wake Henry up.

"Wake up faggot." He smacked him on the sides of his face.

Henry slowly woke up, the blood on his faced dried. Felix smiled, "There we are."

I dug in Henry's pocket and snatched my phone, "This is mine."

"Might want to call your friends," Felix informed, "Tell them where you are and you're okay."

I nodded and started outside, "Nice place by the way."

He smiled as I stepped outside.

As I shut the door behind me, I turned on my phone on and dialed Cole's number. It rung twice before he answered,

"Geez Sean, you fucking bastard." Cole laughed.

"What'd I do?" I asked.

He sighed, "Are you okay?"

I looked down, "Yeah,"

"Was it Frankie?"

I was silent, "No."

"Then who?"

I looked up, "Henry."

He was silent, "Henry?"

I sighed, "Yeah."

"What'd he do to you this time?"

I didn't answer.

"How'd you get away?" He asked.

I smiled, "My brother."

"But, you're an only child."

I huffed, "Not no more. He knows you. Knows us,"

"What's his name?"

"Felix Gulber."

"You sure he's your brother?" He sounded worried.

"I guess." I admitted.

He sighed, "I met him back at the Triton Agency."

I froze, "What?"

"Yeah, he said he was an agent. They even had a file and a picture. They tried to kill him."

I looked around, "Got to go."

"You sure you're okay? Where are you?"

"I'm at his safe house, don't know where." I informed.

He sighed, "Be careful."

"I am, see you soon." I hung up.

Sighing, I went back inside the safe house.
I walked in just as Felix punched Henry square in the face. Henry's nose was bloody; he'd been punched more than once.

I stopped behind Felix, "We need to talk."

"I'm in the middle of an interrogation." He informed.

I went up behind him and grabbed him by the shirt and threw in out the door. He stumbled backwards and then regained his footing.

He looked at me crossed, "What was that for?"

I looked him in the eye, "Are you really my brother?"

"You don't believe me?"

I looked away.

He sighed, "I'll prove it to you." He walked down the street and into a room.

Seconds later he came back with a picture and handed it to me.

I looked at the picture, "Is this?"

He nodded and pointed to everyone, "That's mom, that's dad and that's me, and you're the little bugger in her arms."

I looked away and laughed, "Dude, I can't get over the accent."

He laughed, "I couldn't at first either."

"Was it like an overnight project?"

He shook his head, "Nah mate, just a yearly trap in hell."

I nodded, "Oh."

He put his arm around my shoulder, "Like I said mate, we're brothers."

I shook my head and laughed, "That made no sense."

He shrugged and walked back in the room with Henry, "Don't have to."

I sighed and shook my head, I really had a brother. Always wanted one and this time I got to keep him.

"You wanna help me interrogate the subject?" Felix asked.

I laughed, "Sure." I approached Henry.

"What kind of questions are we asking?" I asked Felix.

"Not really asking questions, just fucking him up for touching my lil bro." He informed.

I nodded, "Oh."

Felix punched Henry in the face, "So, why'd you do it?"

Henry spit, "You know why asshole. Now let me go!"

Felix rubbed his fist, "Oh you're never leaving. Only way you're going is up."

"Or down." I pointed out.

He nodded, "Right."

Henry laughed, "I have connections, really good connections. So if you kill me, you're screwed."

"Dude, I've been screwed." I informed.

Felix nodded, "Exactly."

Henry shook his head, "You're in more shit then you know. Frankie will kill you."

I froze, "You work for Frankie?"

He huffed, "Frankie works for me."

I looked at Felix, "I got to go man."

He nodded and took his gun out, "Your got going anywhere without me." He aimed his silenced pistol at Henry.

Henry looked up at us, "You cannot kill me!"

"Watch me sunshine." Felix pulled the trigger.

I flinched, "Can we go now?"

He lowered the gun, "I'll clean this mess up later. Come on."

We turned and walked out the front door.
On the road, I showed my brother where our safe house was. It was about an hour drive. We barely talked the whole ride, the music choice was good, I couldn't complain. I guess we like the same artists in rap.

I stared out the window thinking most if the time. I had a lot of crap on my mind, and I had to figure it out.

When we arrived at the safe house, it was getting dark. As I got out, Felix stopped me.

He smiled and handed me a medium sized box, "Happy birthday baby bro."

I knit my eyes, "What is it?"

"Open it and find out." He insisted.

I ripped the box open and saw what was inside. I smiled, "You shouldn't have."

He shrugged, "You're my brother."

I lifted the golden pistol into the air.

"Might want to take it inside," He suggested.

I put it back in the box, "Good idea."

We walked inside safe house and were greeted by Cole. He came up to us and smiled, "Good to see you again Felix."

Felix nodded and shook his hand, "You too mate."

I went to the kitchen and took out my new golden pistol. I turned it to the right side and read what was engraved, 'Νο Απολoγιες.'

I looked over at Felix, "What's it say?"

He turned to me, "It's in Greek; it says 'No Apologies.'"

"You study Greek?" I asked.

He smiled, "Kind of."

I looked at Cole, "Where's everyone at?"

He sighed, "Looking for your ass."

I cocked my head, "Really?"

"How sweet," Felix laughed.

"Did you call them?" I asked Cole.

He nodded, "Yeah, they should be here any minute."

I stuffed my pistol in the back of my pants, "That's good, James leave?"

Cole shook his head, "Nope, he went with them."

"And you stayed here?" I guessed.

"No, I was the last one to leave; I was out front when you called." He informed.

"And you came back inside." Felix took a seat on the couch.

Cole nodded, "Right." He looked at me, "Nice shirt by the way."

I looked down at the shirt I was wearing and laughed, "Thanks."

Cole looked at Felix and then at me, "Did your brother tell you that he was an agent of the Triton Agency."

Felix laughed, "He doesn't care about that."

"I already knew, Cole told me." I informed.

Cole nodded, "That's right; I told your brother that you were in the Triton Agency because you couldn't do it yourself."

"Cole!" I yelled, "Can I speak to you outside?"

He looked at me, "Sure."

I started towards the front door as he followed me outside. He shut the door behind him.

"What's up with you?" I asked turning to face him.

He sighed, "I don't think he's really your brother."

"I didn't trust him at first either, but he showed me a picture. He saved my life. Cole... He killed Henry." I explained.

He nodded and looked down, "I'm sorry man, and it's just" He sighed, "I don't know."

"It's about what happened back in Vegas isn't it?"

"I just don't want to see you like that again, your one of my best friends."

I looked at him, "It won't happen again, Henry's gone. And this time it was really him."

He knit his eyes, "What do you mean, it was really him?"

"I mean, last time it was his clone." I whispered.

He gasped, "No!"

I nodded, "Yes."

He laughed, "Let's go back inside."

As we turned to go back inside, a familiar voice yelled my name. I turned and saw Derek running up to us; he stopped in front of me.

We looked at each other and he held out his hand, I took it and we shook. He smiled and brought it in for a hug.

"What can I say that doesn't sound gay?" He laughed.

We separated as Ken, Joey and James came up to us. I went up to them and hugged them. (It's a friend thing)

I looked at Derek, "You can say that you missed me, or, I'm glad to see you're alive."

He laughed, "I'll just say we're glad your back."

I nodded, "That works."

Ken put his hand on my shoulder, "Who was it this time?"

I looked at Cole, "You didn't tell them?"

He shook his head.

I sighed and looked down, "It was Henry."

They were silent.

"Henry?" Ken asked. He took his hand away.

I turned, "Yeah, the bastard."

"You okay?" asked Derek, he looked at me.

I nodded, "Now, thanks to my brother."

"Brother?" The three of them said the same time.

"You have a brother?" James asked.

I laughed, "Yeah, he's inside."

"Well let's go meet him." Joey pushed my shoulder.

I looked at Cole, "Yeah, come on."

We turned and started inside.
"I can't believe it," Felix approached us, "The two legends that came together to destroy a scared embassy."

James held out his hand, "That's us."

Felix took it and they shook hands right before James brought it in for an awkward hug.

They separated a Felix looked at me and smiled awkwardly. I shrugged and laughed.

Ken held out his hand, "I'm Ken."

Felix took his hand and they shook.

"Felix and I know exactly who you all are." My brother said.

Derek came up to him and held out his hand, "I'm Derek, how do you know all of us?"

They shook and Felix spoke, "I was in the Triton Agency before... Well you know. Plus I've been keeping an eye on my little brother for some time."

"And we haven't noticed you?" Joey asked.

"I'm that good." Felix smiled.

I nodded, "Sure."

"Hey, I got to tell you guys something." James said looking down.

We looked at him.

"I had a friend look into something for me, he got too deep and some things came up. Well, to put it the easy way... Frankie is waiting for us. He said if we don't go where he wants us, he'll kill a hundred people a day." He explained.

"What?" Cole gapped.

James nodded, "Yeah, I know."

"Where does he want to meet?" I asked.

He looked at me, "He wants to meet at the burnt down Mid-Atlantis Region."

I nodded, "Okay, let's go."

"Hold your steel horse's man; you can't just go barging in there." Felix informed.

"Your brother's right, Sean, it's too dangerous." Cole agreed.

I laughed, "Come on, it's the only time we finally get to kill the bastard."

"We'll have another chance, it might be a trap." Joey said.

I huffed, "You guys are just pussies."

"Excuse me?" Ken looked at me.

"You heard me, all of you." I spit.

He came at me but Felix and Cole pushed him back. I looked at Derek, "Don't be a pussy."

He sighed, "Sean, think this through! It's stupid!"

I looked down, "The bastard needs to die."

"And he will, just wait." James assured.

I looked at him, "I can't wait! We know where he is! Why not go get him now?"

"Because it's risky!" Cole faced me,  
"You know exactly how slick the bastard is! He might have the whole thing planned out!"

"Yeah well, plans sometimes don't work out the way you planned." I mumbled.

He rolled his eyes, "Sean."

"Don't Sean me!" I yelled, "Look at my face! Look what the bastard did to me! I want revenge!"

"And you'll get it!" Cole added, "Just when it doesn't involve you dying in the process!"

"But it involves a hundred innocents dying?" I asked.

"Don't put that on me." Cole mumbled, "We got to do what's best for us."

"And letting a bunch of people die is best for us?" I cocked my head.

He sighed, "I didn't mean it like that."

I looked at him, "I know you didn't, but hear me out. If we kill this bastard, we'd be saving the lives of a bunch of people. Isn't that what you signed up for the Triton Agency for?"

He nodded, "Yeah, but..."

"No buts!" I interrupted, "Can we do this or not?"

He sighed, "No."

I laughed, "Whatever."

"It's not that we want a bunch of innocents to die," Joey informed, "Hell, I even what to get the bastard. It's just that if we all go in there, it might be the end of The Crew."

I looked down, "I guess you're right."

Derek came up to me, "That's good, now mean it."

I punched him playfully, "Shut up."

He smiled, "let's party, it's someone's birthday."

I shook my head, "Nah, you guys go ahead without me."

"Then the party is cancelled." Joey said.

I shrugged.

"Hey, Frankie isn't going to kill a bunch of people. I know him, he cares about innocents. Well, kind of. But he won't try anything with a bunch of helpless lives." Felix informed.

I looked at him, "You sure?"

He nodded, "Have trust in your big brother mate."

I laughed, "Still, the accent."

"Get used to it." He smiled.

I nodded, "I'm trying."

"So what do we do in the meantime?" Ken asked.

"In the meantime of what?" Cole questioned him.

"Tomorrow?" Ken guessed.

"Let's figure out how to deal with the asshole." Cole ordered.

We nodded in agreement and he waved for us to come around the kitchen counter. We all gathered around, except for Felix who stood in his spot.

Cole looked at him, "You too, Arrow."

Felix looked back at him and smiled, "I don't go by that anymore." He joined us.

"And you go by, let me guess, Felix?" Joey suggested.

Felix cocked his head, "Kind of, after I got into the new agency, they changed it."

"New agency?" I asked.

He nodded, "Yep, the people only on patrol agency. Also known as The P.O.O.P Agency,"

I laughed, "The Poop Agency?"

He huffed, "Yeah."

"I bet they're the shit." Ken laughed.

"They are. That's their slogan." Felix informed.

I noticed something then looked at Derek, "Where's Darrell?"

"He went out, couldn't stand to be around you fools." He informed.

I huffed, "I ain't no fool!"

He shook his head, "No, not you fool. Them fools." He pointed to Cole, James and Ken.

"I was acting normal." Joey pointed to himself.

"What were they doing?" I asked.

"Don't even ask." Derek shook his head.

"I already did, now tell me because if they took my shit, I'm going to fuck them up." I informed.

"Good luck." Ken mumbled.

I looked at him, "You wanna tussle?"

"Is that a threat?" He asked.

I thought about it, "It didn't sound like one."

"It was." He gave an evil smile.

I stepped back and gave an awkward laugh, "Okay, you look like a rapist."

He smiled and looked to the side, "Oh I am."

I looked down, "Okay, it just got awkward."

Joey and Derek laughed.

"Look, its Ken trying to be funny!" Joey laughed.

Ken jumped at him, "Screw you, okay? Screw all of you."

"What'd I do?" Cole asked.

"You're encouraging them!" Ken informed.

Cole laughed, "Am not."

He rolled his eyes, "Whatever."

"You guys are grumpy." James laughed.

I walked towards the backroom, "I'm going to lie down." I stopped in front of the first room with Bobby inside.

"Yeah, he stopped talking an hour ago." Cole informed.

I watched him as he looked at me, with an evil look on his face. I stepped inside the room, "Hello faggot."

He looked up at me; the tape covered his mouth still. He looked down at his wrists then back up at me.

I shook my head, "No can do Stew."

He looked away as I bent down in front of him and ripped the tape halfway away from his mouth.

I looked at him, "You're lucky man, a worse bunch could of tied your ass to that chair, be thankful we haven't touched your ass yet."

He looked at me, "Be thankful? All I wanted was a truce."

"Well that didn't work out the way you planned, huh?" I smacked him softly on the side of his face.

"Because of your team," He nodded to Cole and them, "Bunch of... Can't even say it,"

"Fishes? I know." I smiled.

He shook his head, "No, more like a bunch of gay people."

I huffed, "We are not gay. How many times do I have to tell you people that?"

He laughed, "Whatever you say partner."

I stood up, "I am not your partner, buttwad."

"Did you just call me, a buttwad?" He asked.

I nodded, "What are you going to do about it?"

He bit the air, "Come here and I'll show you!"

I bent down and got in his face, "Wanna play a game?"

He looked at me, "Sure."

"Open your mouth." I ordered.

He obeyed and I put my finger inside his mouth, just above his tongue. Right before he snapped shut, I quickly pulled my finger away.

I laughed, "Ha-ha! Better luck next time."

"Again!" He requested.

"Okay."

He opened his mouth and I placed my finger above his tongue. Seconds went passed before he slammed shut, before I had a chance to pull my hand back. His chompers slammed down on my pointer finger.

I yelled in pain, "Fuck!"

Cole and Ken came rushing in with everyone behind them. I held my throbbing finger in my hand.

"What happened?" Cole asked.

"He bit me!" I informed them.

Bobby laughed, "We were playing a game."

Cole looked at me, "You were playing a game with our prisoner?"

"Well when you put it like that, yes," I cocked my head to the side.

They rolled their eyes and slowly went back to the living room. I looked at Bobby, "Have a good night, prisoner."

He laughed as I replaced the tape over his mouth. I stood up and went into the room next to the room he was in.

The bed was empty, I was planning on just lying down for an hour, but when I put my pistol down took my shoes off, laid down and closed my eyes, I was soon fast asleep.
"Breaking news! Just an hour ago, this building filled with a hundred hostages and a bomb, burned down in Jacksonlong Township, it is estimated that a total of a hundred hostages were murdered during the explosion." The television blared with important news.

I stared in disbelief as the TV showed the burning building and people reacting to the smell of burning flesh. I stood up and took a step forward.

"Sean!" Cole yelled behind me.

I turned and saw him approaching me. He stopped in front of me and placed his hands on my shoulder.

"What did you do?" He yelled.

I looked at him crossed, "Me? I didn't do shit!"

He lifted his hand and that's when I saw the gun he had pointed at me. I stepped back, "Whoa, Cole."

"This is all your fault!" He yelled.

I raised my hands, "Cole! Don't!"

"How could you let this happen?" He asked, "All those innocent lives!"

"Frankie did it! Not me!" I informed.

"No! You had the chance to stop him!" He yelled.

"I didn't know!"

"Yes you did! You always did!"

I stepped back shaking my head, "It doesn't have to end like this!"

He cocked the gun, "Yes it does."

I blinked and he pulled the trigger, the bullet and smoke appeared and it made its way towards me. It got closer; its roundish shape punctured my clothes then soon my skin.

The pain hit and I was on the ground. Cole came up to me and looked down at me as he pointed the smoking gun in my face.

He smiled, "You were always a fish." Then he pulled the trigger.
I sat straight up in the bed, heart racing. I looked around, I was in the safe house room and next to me was my best friend. It was all a dream.

I ran my hand through my hair and looked over at Derek who was fast asleep. My first thought was that sleeping together is so gay, but I pushed that aside.

My next thought was about my dream, or nightmare. I stood up, put my shoes on and walked out of the dark room. The kitchen light was on so it wasn't that dark outside of the room.

I noticed Felix and James sleeping on either side of the couch in the living room. I walked back into the second room with Derek and grabbed my golden pistol from the table next to the bed.

I quietly crept out and shut the door behind myself.

I was about to make the most important decision of my life. That dream, it wasn't about to come true, and I wasn't about to let it happen.

The clock on the wall said it was eleven thirty, I hadn't slept long and it was still my birthday.

I looked into the room with Bobby; he was asleep still tied to the chair. I walked in the room and ripped the tape from his mouth.

He jolted awake, "What're you doing?"

I shushed him, "We're going for a ride."

I went out of the room and went into the kitchen and grabbed a switch blade from the cabinet. I then walked back into the room and cut Bobby's bonds then closed the blade and put it in my shoe.

"Why are you doing this?" He rubbed his wrists.

I looked at him, "You want a truce?"

He nodded.

"Then come with me." I turned and walked out the room.

He followed me out of the room as I headed towards the front door. My golden pistol still in my hand, I stuffed it into the back of my pants.

"Don't I get a gun?" Bobby whispered.

I looked at him, "Hell no."

He sighed, "Fine."

As I grabbed the keys to Felix's car we walked out of the front door, I unlocked the car and we got in each side as I stuck the key into the ignition and turned it to the side.

The car started and I put it in drive then drove off down the street.

"Where are we going?" Bobby asked.

I turned left, "To meet your loving brother."

He sighed, "He may be my brother, but he does not love."

I laughed, "Whatever you say sparky."

He shook his head, "You are one strange man."

I looked at him, "You try anything, and you're dead."

He held his hands up, "I won't, I swear."

I made a right turn and he looked at me, "You know he's going to kill you right? Why are you doing this? By yourself?"

I shook my head, "It's none of your business."

"He's my brother and he's going to kill you, I think it is my business." He laughed.

I took my gun out and cocked it then stuck it in his face, "I said it's none of your business."

"Okay, okay. Sorry." He mumbled.

I uncocked it and put it back in my pants then sighed, "I'm guessing you don't want me to tell Frankie about the whole truce thing."

"Yeah, I mean, no. That would be bad." He sighed, "He'd kill me."

I nodded, "That I figured."

I made a left turn then stopped a traffic light. As I looked around I noticed there were about three cars around us. Nothing to panic about, but for a caution I took out my pistol and held it on my lap.

Seconds felt like hours and soon the light changed to green and we sped off. I stepped on the gas to get ahead of the cars.

When it was clear, I put my pistol back in my pants and continued down the street. The rest of the ride to Mid-Atlantis was silent, the radio played some good songs and I found myself singing along.

We pulled up out front of Mid-Atlantis about a couple minutes later. I turned the radio down and looked over at Bobby, "Might want to go now."

"What? No way, I'm staying to help you out man." He informed.

"This is your chance to be free, away from your brother and from us."

He shook his head, "I may be betraying my brother, but I sure am not leaving you to kill yourself."

"It's not a question, bye Bobby." I unlocked the door.

He looked at me, "Take care of yourself man."

I nodded, "See you around?"

He smiled, "I hope." He opened the door and got out.

As he shut the door, I watched him walk away behind the car. When he turned the corner he was out of sight.

I opened the car door as I popped the trunk, I know I barely knew my brother, but if I knew an agent of the Triton Agency, Felix would have some weapons and ammo hidden in the trunk.

I walked to the back and the inside was empty, I felt around for a lever, it was on the right side; I grabbed it and pulled it.

The top opened up and revealed a secret compartment filled with guns and ammo. I stared in awe, it was a happy sight.

I saw pistol ammo and I grabbed a few magazines and stuffed them in my right pocket.

There was a SC3000 in the holder in the middle of the weapons; I grabbed it and some ammo.

I shut the trunk and cocked my rifle, it was already loaded. Turning, I started towards the burnt down Mid-Atlantis.

I stopped out front of what was left of the building then noticed words written on the wall in white paint, 'You'll All Pay!' It stood out against the black wall.

"Frankie!" I called walking into the building.

I looked around, the walls were burnt down and black from the fire. There were ashes on the ground; I could still feel the heat from the flames.

"Look who finally decided to show up." A familiar voice said behind me.

I spun around and aimed my gun at Frankie as his friends came up next to him.

"Don't shoot." He held up his hands, "Thought your team was too scared to show. Where are the rest of them?"

"I'm the only one who came." I informed.

He laughed and nodded, "That's okay. I'll just have to kill you first."

The four of his friends whipped out pistols and machine guns.

I laughed, "Look at those petty weapons, my pistol has more class then that!"

"Shall we tango and see?" He asked.

"Dance? To what?"

"Music my friend, we shall dance to music!"

I nodded, "Dance to this." I pulled the trigger and shot him the stomach and chest.

Shots went off and I ran to the side, hiding behind a fragile wall. The bullets passed through the wall, I moved over as the bullets whizzed past my head.

I got to the corner of the wall and peeked out, aiming my rifle at one of Frankie's friends and fired. He went down and the rest of them took their aim on me.

I ran to another wall and gave some cover fire while I found another target. They separated and it was hard to find them each.

Frankie was on the ground, still moving from what I saw. His goons, what was left of them, separated and flanked on my last known position.

I saw one of them checking from behind a wall, I took him out and the rest of them fired at me. I was behind a wall, some but not all of the bullets past through.

There were two of his goons left and I was running out of bullets for my rifle, I thought I had more magazines but I picked up a different set of ammo.

"You're not going to make it out alive asshole!" Someone yelled.

I got up and faced one of two of Frankie's friends; I looked at him, "Don't count on it." I pulled the trigger and shot him dead.

As sirens sounded in the distance I noticed the bullets from the rifle ran out and I was forced to throw it to the side. I took out my golden pistol and hunted the last guy.

I saw him standing over Frankie looking around in the opposite direction then from where I was. He had a desert eagle in his hand and looked nervous.

I shot the gun out of his hand then as it flew to the side; I shot him in the shoulder. I figured I'd let him live, it was Frankie I was after.

As I approached him he scooted back away from me. I held up my hands, "It's alright, I'm not here to kill you."

He froze and nodded, "Okay."

I nodded and stopped above Frankie who lay on the ground holding his bloody wounds.

"How's that for a dance, partner?" I smiled.

He shakily raised his hand and gave me the finger. I raised my hand and aimed my pistol at is face, "Like a pal of mine once said, from us with love, asshole."

He laughed as I pulled the trigger.

"Freeze cracker!" Someone yelled.

I turned, "Excuse me?"

"You heard me! I said freeze white boy!" The police officer yelled.

"Drop the weapon!" Another yelled.

I dropped my golden pistol and it hit the ground with a thud.

"Put your hands up!" The racist officer ordered.

I obeyed and he came closer with his gun aimed at me.

"You are one racist bastard." I informed.

He put his gun down, "Shut up!"

As he lowered my hand behind my back I pulled my hand away and caught him in the face with my fist. He stumbled backwards and reached for his gun but I got to it first and shot him twice in the stomach.

"DROP THE GUN!" Officers bellowed.

I quickly realized what I had done and dropped the weapon, "Don't shoot!"

"Get down! Get down on your belly, NOW!" They ordered.

I got down and they came running up to me and hurtfully put handcuffs on me, I looked to the side to see Cole and everyone else in the distance. Ken held Felix back; he tried to interfere; that wasn't going to happen.

Hands painfully yanked me up and I was escorted to a police cruiser as they read me my rights. But I already knew them.
"What're you in for?" I asked the man sitting across from me.

After I was arrested, and after I was interrogated for more answers for hours, I was taken to a holding cell. There was one other person inside the cell at the time, he was Ken's size and looked like someone I shouldn't mess with. But you know me.

"I stole an army tank and drove it around town." He informed.

I looked at him, "You're kidding?"

He shook his head, "Nope, what are you in for?"

I sighed and looked down, "Shooting a cop, and, a bunch of bikers."

He nodded, "The typical case."

I looked up, "How was driving that tank?"

"It was fun; I crushed cars and ran over babies." He laughed.

My eyes got wide, "Why'd you run over babies?"

"Man, you take crap too seriously."

I shrugged, "I guess I'm gullible."

He looked at me, "Why'd you kill those people?"

I sighed, "It seemed like a good idea at first."

He nodded, "So did riding in that tank."

We were quiet as the door opened and three men walked in, two wore suits and the third was an FBI agent. The two in suits were surprisingly familiar.

"This is the guy." Cole informed the officer.

Felix was next to him, they both looked like a couple of CIA agents. The officer took his keys out and unlocked the cell door.

"Get your ass up and come on!" The officer spit.

I got up and looked at the guy next to me, "See you around?"

"Hopefully," He smiled.

I turned and started towards the cell door with my hands in the air. When I was out, the officer turned my and slapped the cuffs on my hands.

He grabbed the back of my shirt and pushed me forward. I didn't put up any trouble, I had realized what I had done and I didn't want to pay the price.

They led me out of the holding area and to the front door, where we stopped and finished our conversation to the officer, well them, not me.

"Thanks again for your cooperation, this guy really fucked up." Cole informed the officer.

The officer nodded and smacked me on the shoulder, "He's lucky he didn't kill that officer, but he did kill those bikers."

Cole put his hand around the back of my neck and squeezed hard; I flinched but took the pain.

"Yeah, and don't worry, we'll handle this asshole." He said.

"Oh now I'm an asshole?" I mumbled.

The officer got I'm my face, "I bet you were always an asshole."

I shrugged, "I guess."

Felix and Cole turned me and we headed outside. I stopped and turned to the officer, "Tell the cop I shot I said I was sorry."

He huffed, "It's going to take more than an apology to make up for what you did."

I nodded, "I guess."

My brother and boss lead me to the back of their so-called FBI black car. They got inside and shut the doors behind them, and then they started the car and sped down the street.
The whole ride to the safe house was silent, no music or talking the whole way. When we got to the safe house, the rest of the Crew including James came out front. Cole opened the door for me and Felix got me out of the cuffs.

As I rubbed my wrists Cole came up to me, I interrupted him before he could speak, "I know Cole; I already know what I had done."

"Then why the hell did you do it in the first place?" He asked.

I sighed, "I wasn't thinking."

"No, of course you weren't, you never think of your actions!" He raised his voice.

"Can we take this inside?" Joey asked.

Cole nodded, "Good idea."

We all started towards the front door, before we got in Cole started to give me his old speech.

"Your ass is lucky that officer you shot isn't dead! You know what would happen to you if you really killed him?"

I nodded as I shut the door, "Yeah, I know! I'm sorry! Okay? I'm sorry!"

"Sorry doesn't cut it! Sean, do you realize what you have done? We told you to wait!" He yelled.

"If I would have waited Frankie would be alive!"

"If you would have waited that cop wouldn't be in the hospital!" Ken added, he came in my face, "But you had to go, right?"

I pushed him back, "Yeah I had to go! Otherwise a lot of people would be dead right now!"

Felix held him back, Ken's anger was going to explode and I would be the center of it.

"You know if your brother wasn't holding me back, I'd fuck you up Sean!" Ken spit.

"Oh, you'd fuck me up?" I asked.

He nodded, "Yeah! Because of the fucking asshole your being!"

"I'm being the asshole?" I looked at him, "Who's the one threatening to fuck me up?"

"That doesn't even matter now!" Cole interrupted, "I'm just pissed about why you snuck out with our hostage and shot that cop!"

"I didn't mean to shoot that officer! I made a mistake! We all do!" I yelled.

That's when Joey got in it, "You still did it! God Sean, did you even think before you pulled the trigger?"

I rolled my eyes, "I still didn't mean to shoot him; I don't know why I even did it."

"Why would you even think about it?" Cole asked.

I groaned, "I'm sorry okay! How many times do I have to say it?"

"That's enough!" James yelled, "You guys are friends, and one of you made a mistake, deal with it!"

Ken shook his head, "We're not friends no more."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"I mean, I'm through dealing with your bullshit!" He raised his voice, "You have to learn from your mistakes, not us." He started towards the front door, "Bye."

"Ken!" Cole called.

But it was too late, Ken walked out of the safe house, slamming the door behind him. Joey turned, "Got to hand it to Ken, for once, he's right." He looked at Cole, "Sorry boss." Then he turned and went out the front door with Ace right next to him.

"They'll be back." I informed.

Cole turned to me, "Sean, I've about had it with you! All you ever do it cause mayhem! Why do you think I kicked you off the team?"

"Don't tell me you're going to leave too." I said.

He clenched his fist and sucker punched me in the jaw, "Yes! I'm leaving!" He started towards the front door.

"But what about the Crew?" I asked holding my jaw.

He turned, "Fuck the Crew!"

James followed him out the front door. I shook my head and turned to Derek, "I guess it's just you and me."

He shook his head, "No, you and your brother. Sorry man, but what you did was fucked up." He turned and followed James.

I looked down and Felix came up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder.

"Don't tell me you're going to leave too." I said to him.

"I left once and I'm not leaving again." He informed, "No matter what you do."

I nodded, "I really fucked up."

"We all make mistakes."

A gun cocked behind me, I turned and saw that Felix had my golden gun aimed at me. I froze and he spoke, "Forgot this."

I reached for it but he pulled his hand back and shook his head, the gun was still aimed at me.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

He tilted the gun, "Payback."

"You're not really my brother, are you?"

He shook his head, "No, but you do have a brother, it's just not me."

I looked at the barrel of the gun, "Who are you really?"

"I had it all planned out, place that paper in the Triton Agency to make it look like they tried to kill me and I wanted revenge," He explained, "Then act like one of your long lost brothers to gain trust with the Crew, now to kill you guys, starting with you."

I sighed, "Why is it always me?"

"You honestly didn't really think I was your brother?" He asked.

"I had my doubts, but you never answered my question, who are you?"

"My name is Felix, my last name is Morris. My dad—"

"Is Jesse," I finished.

He smiled and nodded then pulled the trigger.
