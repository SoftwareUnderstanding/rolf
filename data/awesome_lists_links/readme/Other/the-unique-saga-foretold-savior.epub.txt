## Prologue

To the wandering traveler, the land is beautiful and peaceful. The countryside stretches to the ends of the Earth, while the sun cascades over the rolling hills and sparkling streams.

To the people who live here though, the picture is quite different. The beauty of nature is an all too brief escape from the struggles that grip the land. There are both benevolent rulers, and others that would rather lead with fear. For better or worse, one trait these leaders share, is the desire to rule everyone under a unified flag. This shared quest has led to countless lives lost, and many more ruined.

The soldiers on the front lines, and their families, suffer the most. Fighting for the same goals, but killing each other on the way there. Most of these kingdoms wage war on a relatively even playing field, with slight advantages being awarded to the castle with the best blacksmiths or elite strategists. Although, there are some individuals that possess abilities that man cannot just create through hard work. These individuals were born different; able to have a significant individual impact over battles they participate in. Not all of these individuals choose to fight in the war. But the ones that do, are called Uniques.

Uniques are gifted people that existed in a lost chapter of the world. Long forgotten from history, their origin is a mystery and some normal people fear them. Uniques are most valuable during war times as they are worth about 20 normal men. One Unique is about join the war, believing that he can make a difference. Many people have shared his belief, but he hopes to avoid sharing their fate.
To young William:

The people, whether they fear you or not, wish you success. Peace is only a fleeting concept for most, as the heartbreak attached with never hearing from family that joined the war, lives with us all. We wait by the fireside, we fight alongside you, we give you direction and purpose, we follow you on your pursuit, and we all share one belief; that one day peace will permanently arrive, and you will be here to share it with us.

Well Wishes.

## Leaving Home

The sun is setting, casting dancing shadows onto the cliff that WIL is sitting on. The cliff overlooks a vast and dense forest that stretches as far as the eye can see. Wil looks down his arm to his hand, watching a stream of blood slowly trickle down. A broken sword lay next to him. There is a design that starts at the base and travels up the sword. The groove is darker and curves up, but is abruptly stopped as the sword is no longer a sword. His clothes, or what is left of them, are in tatters. A boot is missing and the other is barely being held together by its threads.

Wil attempts to get up with both arms, but stumbles to his knee as his left arm gives out on him. He grimaces in pain as he pauses. He resumes getting up with both hands, fighting through the pain. Wil turns around, now staring at a small cottage. Smoke is billowing out of the chimney, and the smell of a freshly cooked meal is wafting through the air. He walks toward the house with a slight limp.

Inside the house is Wil's MOM, Maribel. She looks older than she actually she, due to years dedicated to war. She is tall, and has the weight to handle herself against any man. Maribel used to be a Unique, but decided to leave that life behind for the safety of her child. Wil has not developed any special abilities yet, and it is unknown by his family if he ever will. Maribel looks concerned as she serves dinner.

Wil's DAD, John, is sitting at the table reading a book. He is slender which beguiles his abilities as a soldier. There are scars running up and down his arms and presumably his entire body. He has a bald head and it looks slightly dirty like someone rubbed mud on it.

MOM

John, would you please fetch William.

Mom looks up and sees Wil as he walks through the door.

MOM

William, I asked of you not to venture into the Lush Lands. You can't bring your uncle back. Please clean up.

Wil takes a seat at the table. He looks angry but can't find the words to express how he feels. Mom glances at Dad and shakes her head. She walks over to Wil, places her hand on his face, and asks him to close his eyes. Wil does so, as a tear streams down from his face. He opens his eyes, and his wounds are gone, looking like he was never injured.

MOM

The food's ready, so please eat.

Wil stands up.

MOM

No! You sit back down and eat. There is nothing that needs to be said. We understand your pain, but do not do something that we will all regret! Please....

Mom turns away and walks to her room.

MOM

I'm not hungry.

Mom closes the door behind her. Dad looks up at Wil.

WIL

I need to leave and finish what Uncle Warren started. You know how much time I used to spend with him. I loved being out on the road, traveling from here to there. He died trying to piece our broken land together, and I need to continue his dream. I promise to return as soon as I can. I'm leaving tomorrow.

DAD

Your mom's been expecting you to say that for some time, although not tonight. Sit down; it's time I told you about all of this.

Wil sits back down.

DAD

In addition to a healer, your mother is also a seer. You've been around plenty of Uniques before, during the time with your uncle. You know about most of the different powers that exist. We didn't tell you before because if you knew she could view your future, it may have disrupted your mind growing up. Back when you were with Warren, not many Uniques used their powers publicly, keeping their talents hidden while living among normal people. Most still only expose their power when necessary. A great number of commoners still fear them, or us, although in these times of war, armies use Uniques to grant their side a slight advantage. Most of them aren't too powerful and can be defeated by skilled normal humans, but they still provide an edge.

WIL

So, Mom has powers, Uncle Warren has powers, you have powers. Why don't I?

DAD

Your uncle didn't have any real powers, but, that's another story. As for me, I'm as normal as they come. I'm told my dirty scalp is a side effect of an ability, but the only ability I seem to have is being able to resist your mother's abilities; which, believe me, is one reason we've been together for so long. You take after me in that you have no abilities. Your mother's visions of you are hazy at best, but we still don't want you to leave because while you're talented and strong willed, you're not a Unique. And entering the war would doom you to our lives. While your mom and I have had great successes, we've also experienced the pain of three lifetime's worth.

WIL

So if you and Mom knew I would leave anyway, why didn't you tell me sooner?

DAD

I wanted to tell you, but your mom didn't want to speed up the process. Especially with the way the land is currently. There are too many different factions, and we're doubtful any of them truly have the best of intentions.

Dad pauses; contemplating what he's going to say next.

DAD

Your mother foresees that you will venture forth and within five years time, the wars will lead to your death.

Wil sits quietly, thinking. He starts to eat his food.

WIL

Will she be OK?

DAD

Don't worry about her.

Dad looks down at his food, and then back up at Wil.

DAD

I'm not hungry myself. You finish up and then rest, I'll tend to your mother.

Wil continues eating. Dad gets up from the table and walks toward the bedroom.

Mom is sitting calmly on the edge of the bed. She is furiously writing in a notebook as Dad walks into the room. She instantly closes the notebook and places it down on the bed. Dad closes the door and they speak softly so that Wil cannot hear them.

MOM

So, did you tell him what I told you to say?

DAD

Writing those wish spells again? Please don't worsen the situation, Maribel. Our son will have enough to deal with, without you attempting to interfere and possibly complicating things. And yes I told him five years, but he's grown now. Being around the battlefield hastens maturity. And there's no need to lie to him. You know that he's very capable.

MOM

I'm not lying to him; I'm directing him to a safe life. And if he doesn't stay out of the way he is the one who is going to make the wars worse. Everything is tolerable as it is. End of point.

Back in the kitchen, Wil finishes cleaning the table and goes to his bedroom. He packs his belongings and comes across a rope necklace with a whistle hanging from it. The whistle is about three inches long and very slender with one hole on the side. Wil smiles as he remembers someone telling him, "We're going to see each other again. Keep it safe". Wil wraps the necklace around his upper arm and finishes packing. He sits on the edge of his bed, thinking about whether he should leave now or wait until tomorrow.

Wil stands up and slings a sheathed sword over his back and picks up his knapsack. He leaves the house and quietly closes the door behind him, deciding to head south and join the first army he sees. Wil walks away from the house.

DAD (O.C.)

Son! Hold on.

Wil pauses and turns around. Dad walks up to Wil.

DAD

Forget about the death in five years thing. Your mother's a bit controlling at times. She did see your early death, although she was unable to see when it will occur. In reality, you're destined to be great, call it a father's intuition. Some things to remember: It will get worse before it gets better; change for peace is rarely easy... or peaceful. Don't waste your opportunities when they show themselves. And don't ever worry about your death; everybody has to die sometime. Life is not a tragedy, but a blessing. Use your blessing to save others.

Wil steps forward and hugs Dad with the feeling that it may be the last time. They separate and Wil takes a couple of steps back.

WIL

Bye. Tell Mom that I love her.

Dad nods his head, and gives an approving smile to Wil. Wil turns around and continues his journey. While Wil is walking away in the distance, he can hear the anger in a screaming voice.

WIL

I guess Mom found out.

Outside of the cottage, Mom is yelling at Dad.

MOM

Why did you tell him that?! I told you only to tell him what I told you. Thanks to you our lives will be back in danger; not to mention Wil's. I can't believe that you would go behind my back and betray this family!

DAD

Nothing we could say was going to change his mind.

MOM

That might be the last time I get to see him. Is that what you want?!

Mom stares at Dad and starts to cry. Dad tries to console her, but she knocks him back.

MOM

Is that what you want?

Dad hugs Mom and she cries heavily on his shoulder.

## Getting Acquainted

Wil finally makes it to the Town of Tipour a little past sunrise. He shows no fatigue from the overnight journey and is still fueled by his new situation. Wil continues walking, on his way to find a horse and more supplies.

The town is starting to come alive. The citizens are beginning their morning chores and opening up shops. Wil walks into the market square which is one of the main sections of the town. He witnesses a robbery of an elderly couple, HUSBAND and WIFE, by DURRIKEN, a person wearing light and loose fitting clothing and a mask with white eyes, carrying a crooked wooden stick. He takes a bag of learza (currency) from the couple. Husband tries to stop the thief and protect his wife, although Durriken easily takes him down in one swift motion with his staff. A few other people see the crime, but they do nothing.

WIL

Stop!

Durriken quickly runs and down a back alley.

WIL (mutters)

Of course that didn't work.

Wil chases after Durriken through the back alleys of the town. Wil has trouble keeping up. He loses sight of Durriken at times and feels lucky and relieved to find his trail again. He turns a corner and is tripped by Durriken, who turns to face Wil. Wil gets up from the ground and Durriken throws the stolen bag up in the air toward him.

Wil goes to catch the bag and gets hit right across the face with the staff. Durriken grabs the bag before it hits the ground and turns to flee. While Wil is falling to the ground, he reaches his leg out and trips Durriken, causing him to fall also. Both of them get off of the ground. Wil draws his sword and Durriken crouches into a fighting stance. Wil raises his sword and swings. Durriken blocks with his stick. The sword creates a cut in the staff, exposing the metal underneath the wooden exterior.

WIL (mutters)

I knew that felt harder than wood.

DURRIKEN

Speak up, I can't hear you.

Wil and Durriken continue fighting. Most of Wil's swings miss completely as Durriken is very quick and agile. For the few swings that are on target, Durriken uses his staff to redirect them toward the ground, never completely blocking them with full force. Wil sees that the sword fighting isn't working, so he stabs his sword at an angle into the ground.

WIL

Please, give up. Just return the stolen property and I'll let you go.

DURRIKEN

You're weak. If you're tired you should just return home.

WIL

If that's your choice.

Wil knocks the handle of the sword down, dislodging it and causing dirt to fly up into Durriken's face, disorienting him. Wil charges at him and tackles Durriken to the ground, pinning him down. Wil lets out a slight smile and Durriken returns one of his own.

DURRIKEN

Well, this has been fun. But, I must be going. I live to the south of here in a hut. You won't miss it. Pay me a visit after you're done here.

Durriken disintegrates into the sand, leaving behind the bag of learza and his clothing. Wil looks around but doesn't see anyone. He decides against searching for the thief, as he is only concerned with returning to the couple.

Wil picks up the bag of learza on the ground in front of him.

WIL

Good, my first victory.

He gets up from the ground, feeling proud. He walks back toward the market square to return the money.

Wil sees the couple, and returns the bag of learza.

WIFE

Thank you so much!

HUSBAND

Yes, thank you. Is there anything we can do for you?

WIL

Actually, I do need a horse and some supplies.

HUSBAND

Well, we can give you some supplies and LINDA sells horses in the stables.

Husband points in the direction of the stables.

HUSBAND

Where are you traveling to?

WIL

I'm planning on joining the war effort to bring peace to the land.

WIFE

Good. The person you should start with is QUEEN TRESA. She doesn't care about us at all. She's evil and a Unique and is close to finding others to help her twisted cause. Once that happens, all of the normal people in Saxon territory will be forced into exile. We have made a good place for ourselves here. Those Uniques only care about themselves.

HUSBAND

Honey, be mindful of what you say.

Wife glances at Husband, and then looks at Wil.

WIFE (timidly)

You're not a Unique, are you?

WIL

No ma'am, but I will do everything I can to help.

HUSBAND

Well looking at you, you're going to need all the help you can get. If you desire an animal more powerful than a horse, I think Linda may have some sort of foreign beast. She keeps it hidden and I dare not look, but I've heard strange sounds coming from the stables and she always looks tired. I bet you could get it for a good bargain. She'll probably be eager to be rid of it.

WIL

_Thanks_.

The couple leads Wil to their store. They walk in, and Wil collects the food and supplies that he needs. He walks back to the front of the store and takes out his money to pay.

WIFE

Don't you dare. We will not accept any payment.

Wil looks at Wife and then Husband.

HUSBAND

We're even.

WIL

Thanks for everything. I will not forget your kindness.

Wil leaves the store and walks across the town square to the stables. He enters the door into the front office of the stables. There is a desk and a passageway to the actual stables. Nobody is present in the office.

WIL

Hello?

LINDA

Hold on.

The crash of furniture and the sounds of an exotic animal are heard. Linda emerges from the back of the stables, with her bright red hair a little messy, but still looking stunningly beautiful. She has a few freckles on her cheeks and looks exasperated. She is wearing a regular loose fitting shirt that has a few fresh stains. Wil stands for a moment, admiring her beauty.

LINDA

How can I help?

Wil searches for his words.

WIL

Yeah...Uh... I was referred to you. I heard you are a supplier of the finest transport.

LINDA

Flattery will not get me to change my rates. Tell me which horse you want and he will be yours for 100 learza.

WIL

Actually, I'm not interested in a horse. If you have something else, I will be able to handle it.

Linda pauses for a moment and thinks about Wil's request.

LINDA

Don't know who told you, and at this point, I don't care. If you can get him to go with you then you can have him for 150.

WIL

For 75, I'll take him off your hands without causing any damage.

LINDA

Here's the deal: If you get him out without destroying anything, then you can have him for 75 learza, if he makes a mess you owe me 200.

WIL

Deal.

Wil and Linda walk into the back where there is a huge stable completely taking up one side of the room. A tiny and strange looking griffin-type creature is occupying the stable. The creature is lying down and has disproportionately small wings and four legs. It is not as big as Wil imagined and looks like it will have trouble supporting him. Linda unlocks the stable gate but keeps it closed.

LINDA

Good luck. I'll be upfront.

WIL

Wait! This thing won't even support me.

LINDA

You can still get a horse. I have them next door. But trust me; it's stronger than it looks.

Wil looks at Linda questioningly and then shrugs.

WIL

Beauty never lies. Here's your 75 learza. I can handle anything that comes my way, especially this.

Linda accepts the money with a slight smile, not believing Wil can do it.

LINDA

Sure. You can pay me the rest when you're ready to leave, or just get a horse. It would suit you better.

Linda returns to the front of the store.

WIL

OK, now what? I don't have that much learza left, so failure isn't possible.

Wil places his knapsack on the ground, and sits on the floor staring at the creature. The creature, with its head resting on the ground, turns it slightly to stare back at Wil. The creature turns its head back around after a few seconds. Wil is still sitting and thinking about how he is going to control this beast.

WIL

It's stronger than it looks. It's stronger than it looks. Don't underestimate it. Don't underestimate it. It's stronger than it looks.

Wil gets up and slowly approaches the gate. Without looking at Wil, the creature stands up. It turns to completely face him. The creature rises to its hind legs. Its entire body starts to grow as its front legs shrink away, and the wings expand to a normal proportion.

WIL

I guess you can fly too.

Wil opens the gate and hurriedly gets instead of the stable, closing the gate behind him. The creature returns to all four legs and is as tall as a horse and twice the size. Its wings stretch even further and bunch up on the sides of the stable. Wil is still standing at the stable gate when the creature gets on its hind legs, and using its front legs, knocks Wil out of the stable, partially breaking the gate as it swings open. Wil is knocked all of the way back to the base of the far wall. The creature pauses, and then walks over to Wil using four legs. Wil is dazed and still lying down against the wall. Wil looks up at the creature as it's standing over him.

WIL

What's with me today? Am I wearing a target on my chest? Go ahead and give me your best shot. We're leaving together, no matter what.

Wil attempts to make a quick move to get up, but the creature pins him down before he can escape. The creature lets out odd noises and its eyes start to constantly change colors every second. The creature is also growing bigger in size. Wil looks worried and in his struggling, kicks the creature in the belly. The creature instantly stops making noises and stares angrily at Wil. Wil looks very frightened now.

WIL

This is going to hurt, isn't it?

The creature appears to nod and then pauses before headbutting him. Wil is knocked unconscious. The creature's jaw expands and it takes Wil in its mouth and throws him over its head and onto its back. Wil is laying face down and draped over the creature's back with his legs and head hanging down. The creature lets out a howl and shrinks down in size, into a shape that resembles a horse. It grabs Wil's belongings in its mouth and then runs out of the stables.

Linda is busy moving some of the crates in the main office room, from one wall to another. She has her back turned when the creature runs by, knocking her to the ground. Linda turns and sees the tail of the creature just as it runs out of the office.

LINDA

I guess I sold him short.

Linda gets up and brushes herself off. She walks into the back stables and stands by the doorway. She surveys the room and sees the broken stable gate and a dent in the wooden wall from where Wil landed.

LINDA (angrily)

I knew I didn't sell him short. That scoundrel owes me more money. That is the last time I allow this to happen. I try to trust but..... If I see him again...

The creature runs out of the town with Wil still unconscious and slung over its back.

## My Friend?

There is a small one room hut in the middle of a dusty plain. It is midday and the sun is brightly shining down. The creature is trotting down a path leading to the hut, and it slows to a walk when getting close. It walks up to the front door and gently lays Wil down on the ground. The creature lets out a soft sound. Durriken, the thief from the market, opens his front door and walks out, drinking a cup of water. His eyes are all white. He walks up and pets the creature, allowing it to lap up some of the water in the cup.

DURRIKEN

Good boy.

Durriken empties the cup of water by throwing it onto Wil's face. Wil awakens startled; looking quickly back and forth at his unfamiliar surroundings. Still seated on the ground and his vision slightly blurred, he looks at the creature first, and then glares at Durriken.

WIL

What's your problem, old man?

Wil looks closer at the old man and noticing that his eyes are completely white, remembers him as the thief from the city of Tipour.

WIL

Oh, so you're a fake blind thief with no manners, huh? Being blind doesn't get a thief any sympathy.

DURRIKEN

I'm no thief. Do you see any stolen wares around here? No? You might be a thief though. I'd imagine a creature like this, costs more than you possess. Anyway, thanks for accepting my invitation and welcome to my house.

WIL

You haven't been following me, so I guess you're a Unique.

DURRIKEN (sarcastic)

An astute observation. Do you have another?

Wil looks at the creature that carried him here. It's lying on the ground and has shrunk to its small and weak looking size.

WIL

So, is this thing yours?

DURRIKEN

Well, it used to be Veronica's, but now it looks like you have it. So you tell me.

WIL

Well, what are you looking for then? You obviously went through a lot of trouble to get me to 'accept' your invitation.

DURRIKEN

No trouble. Come on inside. I'm sure you could use a hot meal; you have a long journey ahead of yourself.

Wil looks at Durriken questioningly, but doesn't ask the question on his mind. Durriken is already walking through the front door, as Wil gets up from the ground. The creature gets up at the same time as Wil and follows him into the house and closes the door behind him.

Even though it's the middle of the day, the small house is very dimly lit by a small lone window with many stains. Durriken has one plate of freshly prepared food on the table, with the heat still rising. Wil sees the food for him, and then looks up at Durriken.

WIL

So you're a fortune teller?

DURRIKEN

Don't trivialize my abilities! But yes, just like your mom. Well, better actually. I'm sure that you've heard stories about me.

WIL

No, I haven't. But you're doing a good job creating new ones as a thief.

DURRIKEN

I didn't need the learza, so I left it behind. I had another reason. Believe it or not, I was helping someone out.

WIL

Who? You're a recluse. And with your skills you could help more than just one person. The land is constantly in a state of war if you didn't notice.

DURRIKEN

Hahaha. You should really hear yourself. Just wait until your friends turn into your enemies. And you peek behind the curtain at how the world really works. Well I've been there, and done that. Why should I involve myself with the things I cannot change? Everything is fine the way it is.

WIL

Everything's fine for you because you probably move right before it gets bad. I'm going to help though. My uncle died trying to make that a reality. I'm going to finish his mission. I just need to find the right ruler to serve. Then we can stop all of this.

DURRIKEN

At least you don't lack confidence, or is that stupidity. Quite frankly, you stink. You can't beat an old man or a helpless animal. And to top it off, you don't even have powers yet.

WIL

So, I am part of the Unique?

DURRIKEN

The Unique have powers. Do you? Being such a late bloomer may pose a problem, but you'll press through. You'll have to.

WIL

Why? What's going to happen?

DURRIKEN

It's your life. I'm not going to live it for you.

WIL

At least teach me an ability.

DURRIKEN

I've already done enough for you. We sparred, and I also gave you free supplies, a low priced amazing creature, and a hot meal. My good deeds are over for the next five years by my estimation. When you finish your meal, continue to travel south. If you want to help the land, then join that mercenary band. The leader doesn't know what he's doing, but you'll be on your way. Take the thing outside with you. I don't have a use for it anymore. It doesn't fly, but it's quick and can transform. And lastly, I'll be going.

WIL

What do you get out of giving me this aid?

Durriken fades away in front of Wil's eyes. Wil looks back at the creature which shrugs at him. Wil tosses some bread down to the creature and finishes eating. He stands up from the table and looks down at the creature.

WIL

I guess it's time to get moving.

Wil leaves the house and the creature follows after him. His supplies and sword are laying on the ground right outside of the front door. Wil picks them up and looks at the creature.

WIL

I suppose that you need a name, right? Something short and forceful. What about HOLT?

Holt lets out a roar and grows to the size of a horse.

WIL

Good.

Wil gets on the back of Holt and the creature conforms its back to fit Wil comfortably. They start their journey toward the mercenary army. Durriken emerges from the house and looks at Wil leaving. He goes back in the house and closes the door behind him.

## Join the Fight

Night has fallen and the moon is brightly shining down. There are soldiers milling around in a temporary encampment. They are of different shapes and sizes; not looking like a well organized group. Some are sitting around the fire, while others are talking in small groups. Wil, riding on the back of Holt, arrives to the encampment. He approaches the soldiers sitting around the fire. One of them, SENZ, stands up. He isn't the biggest soldier but looks like he can handle himself on the battlefield. His clothes have holes in them, and he has scars along his arms. Senz assuredly walks up to Wil.

SENZ

Who are you? What brings you to this bunch?

WIL

I'm looking for the captain. I've come to join.

Senz looks at Wil condescendingly.

SENZ

You need more than a weird looking beast to join. And you better not be a Unique either. One is more than enough in our group.

WIL

I am only looking to assist in ending the war.

Wil looks around at the campsite and the other soldiers are sitting around the fire still telling stories.

WIL

And from what I can tell, if I were you, I wouldn't turn down anyone looking to help.

The soldiers stop talking and turn to look at Wil. A young female soldier, NYX, walks up to Wil and Senz. Nyx's eyes are extremely dark, not black, but dimmed heavily. Wil dismounts Holt. The soldiers go back to talking amongst themselves. Senz turns and looks at Nyx.

SENZ

Come to help the weak again? If you defect, then the rest of us will welcome him with open arms.

Senz turns and walks past Nyx, bumping her with his shoulder as he passes. Nyx's eyes quickly flash a dull red color, and then return to their normal color. She turns and faces Wil.

NYX

They do that to everybody new.

WIL

That explains me, but what about you?

NYX

Senz told you why. You must either be new to this entire world, or you're not a very good soldier. And it seems like both are true. You really shouldn't be out here. What kind of beast is that? I've seen some odd creatures before, but the one you possess is even more peculiar.

WIL

I only know that I got it from an even more peculiar man. I'm Wil.

NYX

Nyx.

Wil, with a smile, shakes hands with Nyx. She remains serious.

NYX

Well I suggest you return. Seek training and then attempt to 'help end the war'. As it stands, you'll only help end your life. We cannot protect you.

WIL

I am not looking for protection. I am looking for the captain. I would like to join this army.

NYX

You're looking for Captain CAILAN?! Between you and me, this is not the army to join. Go elsewhere. Like I said, seek training first.

WIL

I was told by a... friend to join.

NYX

Listen to me....

Nyx looks exasperatedly at Wil. He clearly has no intention of leaving.

NYX

This friend; are they trustworthy?

WIL

I'm not sure.

NYX

Well, since you have nothing else to live for and the captain is always looking for new recruits, I won't care anymore. Follow me, Sir Unsure.

Nyx leads Wil to CAILAN's tent. Wil follows her closely, while leading along Holt. They walk in silence until Nyx asks Wil a question.

NYX

Who sent you?

WIL

Some crazy old man with white eyes. It seems like you might know him since you both have an eye condition.

NYX

I don't know any old man with white eyes. Just the soldiers I'm with.

WIL

If these soldiers don't like Uniques, why are you part of--?

Nyx cuts him off.

NYX

We're here.

They arrive at Cailan's tent.

NYX

Don't tell the captain about your crazy white eyed friend.

Nyx walks away before Wil can respond. Cailan is busy looking at maps inside. He is short and round. His uniform looks more ceremonial than functional, although there is something about him where he could probably put up a decent fight.

Wil walks in and looks around. The tent is four times as big as the other soldiers' tents. It is filled with lavish chairs, chests, paintings, and other non-essential items. It strikes Wil as being an unnecessary expense. From what he can see, the only items of any consequence are the maps.

WIL

Hello Captain. I am here to bolster your army. Even though I'm only one man, I can definitely contribute.

Cailan looks up at Wil.

CAILAN

So you just invite yourself in and demand a position, huh? Who told you that you could do that?

WIL

I'm friends with Nyx, sir, and she said that this was the premier freelance army. I'm ready to help.

CAILAN

She never mentioned you before, but I can see why. You're lucky I need soldiers. I have received an assignment from QUEEN TRESA of the Saxon Domain.

Holt is making light noises outside of the tent.

CAILAN

We are on our way to the castle to prepare. See Nyx since she recommended you; she'll get you settled-- I recognize that noise. A white eyed man, Durriken, used to have a creature that sounded like that. Do you know him?

WIL

No sir. I've never heard of him.

CAILAN

Good. You can leave now.

Calian looks down at his maps and Wil leaves the tent. After he leaves, Cailan mumbles to himself.

CAILAN

Maybe he will be better than he looks.

Wil steps outside of the tent and sees Nyx standing a distance away, so he mounts Holt and rides over to her.

Nyx is standing underneath a lone tree, looking up at the sky. Wil approaches Nyx and dismounts Holt.

WIL

Captain Cailan told me to see you about my arrangements.

Nyx continues looking up at the sky.

NYX

I guess you're staying with me then. We'll be low on supplies until we reach the castle.

There is a pause.

WIL

Why don't you support the captain? He seems like he's nice enough, and looks like he knows what he's doing.

She turns and looks at Wil.

NYX

Being in armies my whole life, I can spot a worthy soldier, and a trustworthy ally. You're definitely not it a worthy soldier, but you do strike me as trustworthy; don't spread what I'm telling you around. I don't care about his personality, even though I hate it. All that matters, is do you know how to lead your men. We're low on soldiers because this dolt continues to put us in horrible positions. He can look at his maps and plan for months and still not come up with a winning strategy.

WIL

If he was that bad, his soldiers would have deserted him.

Nyx looks disgusted.

NYX

I guess he has some skill, or luck, but not enough for my liking. When we get close enough to Warduo Castle, I'm switching over. And I suggest that you do the same. Don't waste your potential in an empty field. Warduo has the best armies in the land and it's only a matter of time before they win the war.

Nyx points up at the sky.

NYX

Look at that particular star alignment. Do you see it?

Wil is looking for it, and then shakes his head no.

NYX

Well, I can show you how to read them later. This specific pattern signifies a new hope. So the fact that you arrive here on the same night is a positive sign. But these things are not precise, so maybe not.

WIL

Where's the tent?

Nyx points to her tent and Wil heads that way on Holt. Wil arrives and leaves Holt outside of the tent and is about to enter when he hears the voice of a stranger, BALIN.

BALIN

Wil, come here.

Wil turns and looks for the voice, then walks toward Balin, who is standing in the darkness between the tents. Balin is wearing dark clothes and is a young looking 40 years old, although he is hunched over. His skin is dark and faded.

BALIN

I can guide you through your earth abilities.

WIL

I don't have any abilities. And they'll come to me by themselves.

BALIN

_You don't? You're far behind. Listen, I can help you_.

WIL

I said I don't need any help. I can contribute to the war without all of these old people meddling. I'm tired and have already been training for years.

BALIN

Listen! I am not old! I look great for my age. These abilities can make you a better person, more powerful.

WIL

Durriken sent you, right?

BALIN

There! Even though you shouldn't have that ability, and it doesn't make sense, you already show some of your mother's abilities of prognostication.

WIL

No, just an educated guess. You fought alongside of my mom?

BALIN

A long time ago, but that's a different story. Please let me help you so I can help myself. I was sent to guide you and I need to do so as not to anger the people that sent me.

WIL

What are you talking about?

BALIN

A strong power sent me to help you along. I need to help you.

WIL

How is Durriken involved?

BALIN

There is no time. They will be back soon to check in. If I haven't made progress they will kill me, you, maybe both of us.

Wil, still skeptical of Balin, decides to submit to his plea.

WIL

I can handle myself. But, I won't turn my back on someone who needs help.

BALIN

Many thanks. Hold my hand and we'll go.

WIL

That's OK. I can keep up.

Balin grabs Wil's arm and teleports them both. The energy surrounding them when they teleport away is black. Balin and Wil appear in an empty field. The moonlight is cascading down across the prairie and the mountains are off in the distance. Balin is standing, while Wil is bent down on the ground, in a daze. Balin looks down at Wil and takes a few steps away.

BALIN

Good. Now let's get started.

Wil looks up from the ground. He has difficulty rising to his feet, but he is able to.

WIL

What did you just do?

BAILIN

No time.

Balin reaches his hands out to command the earth in the field. He causes rock pellets near his own feet, to fly at Wil.

WIL

Stop!!

Balin lifts a boulder with his abilities and flings it effortlessly at Wil. Wil dives out of the way.

WIL

Are you crazy? You're supposed to teach me, not kill me!

Balin lifts another boulder and throws it at Wil. Wil evades the second boulder and while he is diving, takes out and throws a knife at Balin. Balin teleports out of the way.

WIL

Fine. I'll stop you by force then.

Wil draws his sword. Wil charges Balin, while dodging the big rock attacks and deflecting some of the tiny rock pellets with his sword. During Wil's charge, Balin creates jagged spikes on the ground ahead of Wil. He doesn't see them and continues to charge forward. Unknowingly, when Wil is about to step on the spikes, they flatten themselves out smoothly.

Wil gets within eight feet of Balin. Balin lifts a huge piece of earth from behind him and hurls it at Wil. It is too big for Wil to dodge and he continues to run forward. The earth flies through where Wil was. Wil falls into and passes out onto the back of Balin, knocking him to the ground and landing on top of him. Balin rolls over and shoves Wil off of him. He looks down, surprised.

BALIN

Hmmm. You weren't supposed to do that.

Wil is lying unconscious on the ground.

BALIN

This was a waste of time. He didn't even do what he was supposed to.

Balin teleports away and returns with some blankets. He covers up Wil, and lies down next to him.

BALIN

We'll rest here and continue in the morning. 

## On the Way

The sun has already risen and is shining brightly over Balin and Wil. Balin awakens.

BALIN

Great, we slept in. Wake up, Wil.

Balin nudges Wil without success. He shakes him, and Wil wakes up. Wil turns and looks at Balin.

WIL

So, I guess I stopped you from killing me last night?

BALIN

You passed out before you used your powers. We need to continue training.

Wil gets up and looks around.

WIL

Why did we just sleep in this field? I need to be with the rest of the army.

BALIN

They can wait. Nobody will notice that you're missing since you just arrived. I took the wrong approach last night. I should have shown you how to do it first.

WIL

I said that last night!

BALIN

I know what I'm doing. And the sooner you can do this, the sooner you can return.

Balin starts to teach Wil the correct form of the earth manipulation technique. He stands side by side with Wil, guiding him through the proper motions.

BALIN

Place your open palm one stip from the ground.

Wil follows the instruction and crouches down to place his hand hovering close to the ground.

BALIN

Now, concentrate, focus, and will the ground to rise up.

Wil follows Balin's instructions. He looks very focused and continues to try. Dirt rises where his fingers are. Wil starts to smile and the dirt drops to the ground.

BALIN

You need to keep your focus. The goal of this exercise is to raise a platform in the ground, not to play with dirt. You need to master the basics, not visit for the moment. You can return to the army now. Practice that when you have the time. You will need to be able to raise the earth the next time I see you.

Before Wil can respond, Balin grabs his arm and teleports them. They appear at the spot where the mercenary camp used to be. Holt is curled up on the ground, waiting.

BALIN

Take your monster and catch up.

Holt snarls. Balin makes a face at Holt.

BALIN

I'll see you later.

Balin teleports away.

WIL

OK, Holt. Let's catch up.

Wil mounts Holt, who takes off very fast down the path to Saxon Castle. After a little bit of time, Wil sees the mercenary army and rides back in the distance, so nobody will notice that he was missing. Nyx sees Wil and falls back to meet him. Senz is the only other soldier to notice. He sees Nyx going back to join Wil, and looks disgusted, spitting on the ground. Nyx, on her horse, rides alongside of Wil.

NYX

What happened to you last night? I thought what I said finally had an impact and you left for good.

WIL

No luck with that. Some guy named Balin stopped me before I made it to the tent. He was rambling about something, where he really had to help me. He was trying to teach me about my potential earth abilities.

NYX

He's always been crazy, but he is a great teacher. Recently, I heard that he got himself involved in activities that he shouldn't have though, and ever since then, he's stayed hidden. For him to come out for someone like you, he must really have faith in your abilities. Follow his teachings at any chance you get. But be wary of his advice. Maybe you do have a chance after all. If you're really a Unique, that might keep you alive long enough to figure this all out.

WIL

Thanks. You're a Unique, right?

NYX

Yes, my eyes give it away, but I'm just a healer. Nothing exciting.

WIL

Why are your eyes so dark?

NYX

It's a side effect of my healing powers... and genetics. My parents were warriors, and I'm the defect child. I got dark eyes and a lousy healing power.

WIL

You are hardly a defect. You're one of a few women on the battlefield. That takes someone twice as strong. And you do it without an active ability.

Nyx doesn't react and continues looking ahead.

WIL

I came across some guy named Durriken before I joined this army. You know him?

NYX

You already asked me that.

Nyx looks frustrated and thinks about her answer.

NYX

He is my uncle. He's very powerful, but only cares about himself. Some Uniques say that he's the most powerful one of us ever, and that he could pluck the world from out of war all by himself. But, he never did, and now he moves from place to place so he can't be tracked down. He's bad news and he disgusts me. He is a coward and there is no chance that he is the strongest of us.

WIL

While we didn't start off so well, Durriken can't be all bad. He told me to seek out this army, and he provided me with supplies.

NYX

He always has an ulterior motive behind everything that he does.

The mercenary army continues their journey to Saxon Castle to meet with Queen Tresa. 

## Guests of the Queen

As the sun is setting, the mercenary band arrives at Saxon Castle. There is no moat and the size of the castle doesn't look as impressive as others that Wil has seen. They enter into the castle and the outside size is deceiving. They are approached by a group of servants.

CAILAN

OK, men. The Queen's assistants will guide you to your quarters. Rest up for the glorious upcoming battle.

The Queen's assistants are dressed in very regal clothes. They guide the soldiers, to a huge enclosed area where they can rest. Wil is the last soldier to enter the area, and is stopped by MELANIE, one of the Queen's assistants. Her face is mostly covered by a hood and scarf.

MELANIE

Please, sir. My name is Melanie and on behalf of the Queen we would appreciate your time.

WIL

Sure.

Wil leaves Holt with the rest of the army. Melanie leads Wil through a set of hallways to the Queen's chamber. The doors are huge and there are multiple inscriptions on them, in a decorative fashion. Melanie opens one of the doors, and motions for Wil to proceed.

MELANIE

Please, enter.

Wil enters the chamber and Melanie closes the door behind him, staying outside. The Queen's chamber is very cold and damp, and there are tiny spiders crawling everywhere. The front of the room is very dim, lit only by a couple of lanterns. The back of the room is pitch black. Wil is greeted by the Queen's top assistant, DINA. She has significant weight on her, and looks very strong. She is wearing a stripped down version of bronze armor, with a knee length chainmail skirt. Wil figures the lack of additional armor is due to her not currently being on a battlefield. She speaks to Wil and has a rough voice.

DINA

Welcome. I'm Dina. The Queen does not summon many people to her personal presence. You are one of the luckiest people in this land.

Before Wil can respond, someone with a pleasant voice speaks.

QUEEN TRESA

What is your name?

Wil looks hard into the pitch black area of the room, where the voice originated from, to see who is talking. She doesn't sound like someone who would keep to the darkness, nor keep the company of spiders. Dina, on the other hand; her voice matched her appearance.

QUEEN TRESA

I will not repeat myself.

Wil still cannot see Queen Tresa who is standing in the back portion of the room.

WIL

My apologies. Wil, my lady.

QUEEN TRESA

Sir William the Destroyer. That sound good? If Balin is right about you, you can be the one to unify the Uniques and help me control the land.

WIL

You're working with Balin?

QUEEN TRESA

Never. I can't stand him, but I do make it a point to know what happens in my land. And, his judgments are never wrong.

Wil is still trying to see the source of the voice. He finally sees the faint outline of the Queen.

WIL

I mean no offense, but I see no need in controlling the land, just bringing peace to it.

There is a pause.

WIL

Why do you feel the need to hide yourself? And stay in the company of these pests?

Queen Tresa doesn't pay his questions any mind.

QUEEN TRESA

Prove your worth in the upcoming attack and weaken Warduo. Then I will put an end to this warring for you.

Dina steps forward and speaks to Wil, before he can respond.

DINA

If you prefer, you may enjoy the night life of the castle. But, I would suggest that you return and join your army to rest for the upcoming battle. Do you know your way back?

WIL

Yes ma'am. Queen Tresa, thank you for your time and I will return after the battle is over.

Wil leaves the Queen's chamber. He starts to walk back to join the army, but hears the partying from the entertainment area. He pauses and then changes direction to enjoy the night life. On his way, Balin steps out from the darkness in front of Wil.

WIL

Yes.

BALIN

I hope you've been practicing, it's time again.

Wil looks disappointed that he won't be able to have fun tonight, and resigns himself to that fact.

WIL

Let's go.

Balin transports Wil and himself to an area in the Blue Northern Mountains. There are plenty of rocks and boulders as they are in a mountain passageway. Wil stumbles as they finish teleporting, but does not fall to the ground.

BALIN

New drill; Moving rocks.

WIL

I haven't even done the first exercise. What makes you think I can do this?

BALIN

Well, you have to. Now, follow my lead.

Balin bends his knees with his legs shoulder-width apart. He reaches his hands straight out, with his palms facing the rock in front of him. He folds his thumbs into his palms. Wil copies Balin's form.

BALIN

Now lift the rock and break it in half.

Balin places his hands together at the side of the thumbs and moves his hands up and then quickly apart, lifting his rock and cleanly breaking it in half. Wil succeeds only in lifting the rock for a half second, before it falls back down.

BALIN

Focus, and try to use my energy this time.

WIL

Use your energy? I don't know how to do that.

BALIN

Just concentrate. It should come naturally for you. Break the rock in one clean motion, quickly. Don't think, just do.

Balin lifts another rock and holds it in place. Wil attempts to lift another rock and struggles to even move it.

BALIN

FOCUS!

In one second, Wil lifts a rock up so fast, that it continues to fly upward and out of sight.

BALIN

Again. We're not trying to throw rocks at the moon. Neither of us would succeed at that.

Balin is still lifting his rock and Wil tries again. He lifts the rock to chest height and holds it steady. He moves his hands apart but doesn't have perfect form. The rock breaks jaggedly apart, sending pieces flying quickly in all different directions. Balin's rock drops and he stumbles back.

BALIN

I didn't think that you had it in you. You took a lot of my power. Now you just need to learn how to control the power and draw from your own strength.

WIL

I still don't know what I did.

BALIN

As long as you have the ability to do it. When you are in trouble, you can rely on your instincts. Practice is the only way your form will be consistently good. Stay here. I have to go.

WIL

Wait! How am I supposed to get back?

BALIN

Oh yeah. I almost forgot. Hurry up and finish.

Wil continues to practice as Balin leans against a rock and watches. He finishes practicing and returns back to the castle.

Morning arrives and light filters into the castle rooms. The walkways are empty as most everyone is still sleeping. In the large dining area, the soldiers eat breakfast and talk about the looming attack. Wil and Nyx eat outside of the dining area and talk. They are sitting on some steps, with their plates in their laps.

NYX

So, where are you always going at night? Not comfortable sleeping with the rest of us?

WIL

I wanted to see the entertainment. The last time I was within the walls of a castle, was as a child. But, Balin stopped me before I could, for another training session. Did you have to train for your powers?

NYX

Balin is the person that took my sword fighting talents to another level. My powers evolved over time, but the first time happened... during an unpleasant time. Hopefully you won't need the same to become a Unique.

Nyx doesn't react positively or negatively when talking to Wil.

WIL

How bad was it, if you don't mind my asking?

NYX

My father was attacked by another Unique. He was blindsided and had no chance to defend himself. After some other soldiers fought the Unique off, I ran up to him. He was badly wounded, and I thought that I was going to lose him. I was able to heal him enough until he got real help. A side effect from the power strain of my first time was that my eyes darkened.

Nyx pauses.

NYX

After that, father didn't want to continue to expose me to the risks of war. But, he shouldn't have abandoned his fellow soldiers; not after they saved his life. And he also abandoned all of the people we were trying to protect and bring peace to.

WIL

Well, he had a good reason, a young gi--

NYX

Let me finish! At that time, the land was horrible on or off the battlefield. We had a chance to change that. After we left, the king of Relia was vulnerable. He would've made a great king for everyone. Father was a big part of his plans. He was the protector of the king at night and a high ranking official during the day. The best king that the land ever saw was assassinated during nightfall, and Dad was never the same. If he was there it never would've happened. We rejoined the effort with various other armies after that.

Nyx leans closer to Wil, and speaks to him quieter.

NYX

KING JARED of Warduo Castle is the most promising leader and also has the best army. Two Uniques share the head duties. One specializes in defense and the other in offense. They'll win the war.

WIL

You've seen them in action?

NYX

Not exactly. But I know the officer leading the defense team and he dreams big for a good reason. The pieces are falling into place for that kingdom to unite everyone and bring prosperity. They're getting ready for an attack on this castle. That's why Queen Tresa is attacking them now; attack before getting attacked. But, it's not going to work. She's the weakest and most headstrong of any royalty and will lose as soon as she's attacked. She's using this mercenary army for a first wave assault, and then sending in her troops as a second wave. That plan won't work. She also looks like the aggressor so when King Jared counterattacks, they look justified.

WIL

She's royalty and a Unique. You're underestimating the Queen.

NYX

How long have you been doing this for again? I just told you what is going to happen. She just wants to convince King Jared not to ever attack her and deplete some of his troops without harming her own. Being royalty and a Unique means nothing if you don't know what you're doing. You better learn quickly about identifying your enemies. If not, you won't last.

Wil and Nyx finish eating and return to the rest of the troops. Captain Cailan rounds everyone up and leads them out of Saxon castle toward the direction of Warduo.

## The Descent of Darkness

Night falls on the traveling mercenary band as they are close to reaching the castle.

CAILAN

We will rest here for the night. And by midday tomorrow, be in control of Warduo Castle!

The soldiers cheer.

SOLDIERS

Yeah! We're gonna win! Down with Warduo!

The soldiers separate and begin to set up their tents. Wil and Nyx walk off and separate from everyone else.

WIL

Why is the plan to attack during the middle of the day?

NYX

He thinks they will be unprepared. The Queen approved the plan because she really doesn't care. Anyway, I'm sure Balin will be back for you tonight. When you return I won't be here. I'm going ahead to Warduo Castle and if you decide to join me that's great. If not, I hope I don't have to kill someone with so much untapped potential. My sword play is unmatched.

Nyx smiles, and then slips away as Wil watches.

WIL

OK Holt, it's just you and me. Let's get some distance so that I can practice.

Wil rides Holt to a safe distance away from the troops where nobody will see or hear him.

Meanwhile, Senz sees Nyx and Wil go in separate directions. He notices that Nyx is heading toward the castle. He rides off after her.

Wil practices his powers and is slowly gaining control. He raises and lowers the ground and breaks rocks in half.

BALIN

Good. You're practicing by yourself finally.

Wil slowly places down the rock that he was lifting.

BALIN

When you master your abilities you will also be able to control more than just dirt and rocks, but don't get ahead of yourself. You picked a good place to practice. The next move is to control the ground floor itself.

Balin moves his hands close together in front of him and in one motion moves them apart as far as he can. The ground cracks a little.

BALIN

My power doesn't extend that far, but with practice you can have damaging effects with this move.

WIL

I hope so; otherwise I'll have to hope my enemies step on the crack and break their back.

BALIN

Stick to fighting because jokes aren't for you.

Before Wil can attempt to do the earth splitting move, a dark figure, DEACON, appears directly in front of his face, facing him. Wil jumps back. Deacon is clearly a person but literally resembles aspects of a shadow. He is bald, slightly faded, and wearing no armor at all; just a tight fitting long sleeve black shirt and black loose fitting pants. Deacon turns his head and looks at Balin.

DEACON

He's not ready yet. You've failed.

BALIN

I-- I never fail. I just need some more time. Please, Deacon.

DEACON

You know the deal.

Wil watches, and doesn't understand what is going on. Balin stands up straight, interlocks his fingers at his waist, and bows his head. Deacon gathers a ball of dark energy in one hand and hurls it at Balin.

WIL

No!

Wil reaches his arm out and makes a wall rise from the ground to protect Balin. The energy ball makes a perfect circle through the wall and goes into Balin. Balin slumps to the ground; his body starts to fade and emit a black smoke.

WIL

What did you just do!? ANSWER ME!!!

Deacon reaches his hand out in the direction of Balin and absorbs the black smoke that is released from Balin's fading body. Deacon just stares at Wil the entire time. Wil lifts a section of the ground and hurls it at Deacon. Deacon teleports out of the way.

DEACON

You'll have to do better.

Wil mutters to himself.

WIL

Stay focused, or you'll fade.

Deacon gives a sinister smile. Wil charges Deacon at full speed. Deacon gathers an energy ball and throws it at Wil. Wil teleports out of the way and to the left side of Deacon. He sprays dirt from the ground into the face of Deacon.

Deacon's eyes light up, during which he cannot see, and disintegrates the dirt before it reaches his face. Wil is nowhere to be seen.

Deacon looks around and the ground beneath him rises fast, taking him upward. Wil comes down from the air and clubs Deacon on the back of the head, knocking him forward flying through the air and toward the ground. Wil lands on the elevated ground as the platform falls apart, causing Wil to fall on the ground. Deacon lands on his feet.

DEACON

Lucky shot.

Wil gets up and charges Deacon again. Deacon throws an energy ball at Wil, who teleports out of the way. Deacon turns quickly to his back and fires a huge interruptible blast. Wil reappears on his original path and while Deacon is firing the blast, Wil generates a small energy ball and throws it at Deacon.

The energy enters Deacon and then Wil encases Deacon between to earth mounds. Wil falls to the floor, almost out of breath. The earth mounds explode and a dark smoke dissipates into the air, quickly heading toward the mercenary camp.

WIL

What is that?

Wil asks the question to himself, and he hears the voice of Balin answer him.

BALIN

That smoke will poison the army. Go to Warduo Castle for help.

WIL

Did you survive?!

Balin does not answer. Wil gets on Holt, who grows bigger and stronger looking. They ride fast to the mercenary camp.

Back at the camp, the smoke enters every person and horse and transforms them. The smoke enhances the soldiers speed and strength, while altering their minds and physical appearance giving them dark and faded skin. Wil gets within earshot distance and can hear a distorted voice that resembles the captain's. He continues to go closer.

CAILAN

LEAVE! ATTACK!

Cailan sees Wil approaching. He looks at two of his soldiers, ORMON and UPTON.

CAILAN (CON'T)

ORMON, UPTON. STOP HIM.

Ormon and Upton nod. The rest of the army, led by Captain Cailan, runs at blazing speed continuing the journey to attack Castle Warduo.

Ormon and Upton stay behind. Ormon takes out his bow and ten arrows, and fires them all at once at Wil. Upton charges at Wil with his sword drawn. Holt grows in size and his wings spread. One wing reaches out and shields Wil from the arrows. Holt falls to the ground as three arrows get past the wings, and hit the creature in the legs and body. The rest of the arrows pierce his wings. Wil jumps off of the falling Holt, drawing his sword, and runs at Upton.

Wil clashes swords with Upton. Ormon takes some more arrows out of his pack. Wil, while fighting against Upton with the sword in one hand, makes the ground grow up around Ormon with his other hand, attaching him to the ground. Wil then creates a wall blocking Ormon's line of sight. Wil fights with Upton shielded by the wall from Ormon's arrows. Ormon keeps firing arrows at one specific spot on the wall, wearing that spot down.

Wil tries to attach Upton to the ground but can't summon the powers. He continues to fight with Upton, unable to land a blow. Upton is successful in giving Wil many small cuts as he can't dodge and block all of Upton's attacks. Wil throws his sword at the feet of Upton, who swings his sword down and blocks it from hitting him. Wil quickly grabs the handle of Upton's sword and pulls it hard towards himself, causing the blade to swing back up and strike Upton in the thigh. This causes Upton to collapse and fade. No smoke is seen. One of Ormon's arrows goes through the hole in the wall and strikes Wil in the side of the upper arm.

Wil grabs his sword and runs around the wall and at Ormon who continues to fire arrows at him. Wil deflects each arrow with his sword as he charges. Ormon grabs the rest of the arrows from his quiver and fires all twenty at Wil in a spread formation. Wil stops running and shields himself with both arms. The arrows hit his body and some break on his skin and others fall to the ground. He looks at his arms which look like a statue's. His arms cause him to fall forward to the ground, from the weight. Wil's sword breaks as he lands on it. His arms turn back to normal and he looks up at Ormon who is struggling to break free from his earth shackles. Wil stands and picks up his broken sword. He walks over to Ormon and cuts him on the arm, causing him to slump to the ground, and fade away.

WIL

Holt!!

Wil runs over to Holt, who still has the arrows in his body and legs. Wil pulls the arrow out of himself and some of the arrows from Holt, who lets out cries of pain.

WIL

We can't worry about our injuries right now. We need to reach the castle.

Wil gets on Holt and they take off as fast as they can. Holt is too injured to move as fast as necessary and Wil notices this.

WIL

They're faster than us. Faster Holt. Faster. We need to get there FASTER!

Wil teleports Holt and himself ahead to the outside of Warduo Castle. Wil falls to the ground off of Holt and is out of breath and looking extremely tired. He looks up at Holt.

WIL

We're ahead.

Nyx and Senz are closer to the castle and arguing with each other.

SENZ

You are nothing without honor. You would just abandon us on the eve of battle?!

NYX

Now you show a willingness to work with me?! Where was that support before tonight?

Wil sees them arguing.

WIL

Nyx!!

Nyx and Senz turn around and ride up to Wil.

WIL

The army's poisoned. Warn the castle. And take Holt with you.

NYX

You can't defeat them by yourself. You need to come with me.

WIL

Hurry, I need help. I can hold them for a little while.

NYX

Not in that condition. Come with me!

Wil doesn't move.

SENZ

Maybe you will be a worthy soldier after all. Either that, or this will be your last battle.

Nyx walks up to Wil and places her hands on his arms. Her hands glow slightly and so does Wil's entire body.

NYX

That should help. But I'm not leaving.

Wil regains his breath and feels better.

SENZ

Please leave us. Someone needs to summon reinforcements, and I've dealt with the spawn before. I assume you know people within the walls of Warduo already; otherwise you wouldn't have left in the night. That's an advantage Wil or I do not have. You will be able to summon assistance faster than us. We'll handle them until you return.

Nyx gets on her horse and leads Holt to the castle. Wil watches Nyx leave with Holt and then turns around and sees the army rapidly approaching. He looks at Senz.

WIL

Thanks.

SENZ

I haven't done anything yet. And you better be able to handle yourself. This isn't going to be fun.

Senz separates from Wil. The troops exit from the forest, quickly approaching the castle. Wil creates random spikes in the ground that cut into some of the approaching soldiers. Then he creates cracks in the earth that cause some of the troops to trip and fall down. Wil tries to create an energy ball, but runs out of power and the energy disappears. He is extremely tired again. Wil hears his death sentence from a distance coming from Cailan.

CAILAN

WEAK WIL. FIRE, GO.

A slew of arrows come flying in. Some miss Wil, while others are deflected with his sword. Although, he can't move fast enough and some arrows pierce his skin. Senz is able to cut many of the troops, causing them to fade away.

CAILAN

DESTROY.

Wil drops to one knee and looks up. Cailan rides up to Wil on his demon horse. Cailan dismounts and kicks the sword out of Wil's hands. The sound of the Warduo castle troops can be heard. Wil tries, but can't move from the fatigue. He just looks into Cailan's eyes. Cailan's voice and speech changes; it's now very dark, intelligent, and altered.

CAILAN

From Lord Mayan's mouth to your ears; this is necessary. Great men exist, only to inspire others through their death.

Cailan swings his sword down at Wil. Cailan's sword strikes Wil, but Wil has turned into a rock statue. The sword doesn't make a scratch and breaks in half. Wil turns back to normal, and slumps to the ground, passed out. Cailan goes to strike Wil with the broken sword, but before he can, a thrown sword partially slices his arm. Cailan falls to the ground and fades away. Smoke escapes from Cailan's body and enters the pores of Wil's skin. Senz runs toward Wil, as the spawn give chase. Castle troops flood out onto the battlefield.

Senz picks up Wil and flings him over his horse. Senz gets on and rides toward the castle and through the charging Warduo troops. The castle's defense troops are able to handle the possessed mercenary army with only a few casualties.

Wil opens his eyes and looks around the room, where the sunlight pours in. He is lying in a bed, and is bandaged over most of his body. He gets out of the bed and feels fine, so he removes most of his bandages. He opens the door and steps out of the room. Nyx bumps into him.

NYX

Oh, I'm sorry.

Wil looks at Nyx and sees that her eyes are completely black. She is walking with a cane.

WIL

Is that because of me?

NYX

You shouldn't be up, and it was going to happen eventually. I'll fully regain my senses soon.

WIL

But, is there--

NYX

This is the cost of war, so get used to it. All of that dark energy should now be extracted from you. We're in Warduo castle and I've already met with King Jared. He thanked us for our bravery. The defense army's leader, GARRICK, already spoke with the king on having us join his army. Garrick was impressed with your abilities and wants you to become a main part of his army.

WIL

Is that the offense or defense army?

NYX

Defense, but don't worry. Garrick will work everything out.

WIL

Well, let's go meet him then. Holt's OK, right?

NYX

It took a while to calm that thing down, but I healed him. Now go lay back down.

WIL

I'll have time later. Let's go.

## Follow Me

Nyx leads Wil down some halls. She stumbles every once in a while but seems to be managing fine.

WIL

You've almost got the hang of getting around.

They stop in front of a room with a closed unmarked plain wooden door.

NYX

This is Garrick's office.

Nyx knocks on the door. They hear shuffling around and then a voice.

GARRICK

Enter.

Nyx turns toward Wil.

NYX

You go in. I'll wait out here for you.

Wil enters the room. He looks around at all of the expensive things in the room. Beautiful artwork, maps, vases, and a chandelier hang from the walls and the ceiling.

GARRICK

What can I say? I have great taste and an even better eye.

Garrick has a very child-like smile.

WIL

You can't tell from the outside, sir.

GARRICK

Keep everyone off balance. If you are unpredictable, the world itself would have difficulty defeating you. For you know not if I am a stark and sacrificing general which my door suggests; if I am an opulent and excessive general which the interior suggests, or if I am just temporarily using this office, which the lack of an exterior door nameplate suggests. What you will learn is that I am a great leader and adapt to any situation. Please, have a seat.

Wil sits down on a comfortable seat.

GARRICK

I saw you do some incredible things last night. You took care of a lot of soldiers by yourself. Not many, or it is doubtful anyone other than you or I, could have done that.

WIL

Thank you, sir. But I was assisted by Senz.

GARRICK

Please, no formalities. And that is what truly makes us Unique; great warriors are willing to follow us into battle.

WIL

What is your ability?

GARRICK

My sword is my real power. My ability is something I like to call, phasing. I am one of a kind, but it is not the most powerful ability.

WIL

So what can you do with it?

GARRICK

I can split between worlds. I see the fallen rise again on their journey to the heavens. It keeps me balanced as a person, but does not help on the battlefield; therefore I focus on my sword skills. If I had to wager, I would say that you were involved in a fight that released the smoke earlier in the evening.

WIL

I was; I saw smoke leave a body and go into camp.

GARRICK

Yes, and it poisoned the troops. The way they looked and moved, you must have defeated a member of the Eclipsilon. But, nobody can defeat them. He must have let you win.

WIL

Why would he let me win?

GARRICK

I am not sure. The Eclipsilon are mysterious. You looked like you did not have maximum control of your powers; and you only have earth powers. Nobody like that can defeat an Eclipsilon member.

WIL

What is the Eclipsilon?

GARRICK

Not many of us have had the privilege of encountering them. They are an organization, run by the dark god himself, Lord Mayan. He gives a fraction of his powers to select individuals, who only wish to fight. Lord Mayan seeks a fighter worthy of being a part of the Eclipsilon's cause, and then grants them additional power. They are only about fighting and war, and usually stay hidden otherwise. He must have seen your potential and let you win to make you stronger. A rumor is that they are attempting to control the land from the shadows in order to prolong the war. They feed off of discord; and the land has been in that state for so long, they have grown very strong. They are not willing to have peace, thus surrendering some of their power.

WIL

I just want to contribute to unifying the land under a good ruler. And to stop the fighting, whomever we have to fight against.

GARRICK

Good. You are in the correct place. I have openings in my army for you, Nyx, and Senz.

WIL

Thanks, but I don't think joining a defense army will do any good. I wish to join an army that will be actively participating.

GARRICK

Ha. This army is far superior to MANCO's army. Give me until this evening before you make any decisions that you will regret. At King Jared's meeting later today, that will change. I will have this army on the offensive and ending the war. I will visit with you later today and tell you of our plans. I suggest you get more rest in the sick room, Nyx's powers are strong, but you should still take it slow. Also, you do not have to worry about using your powers here. The Regulars and Uniques have formed a trust.

WIL

Thank you for meeting with me.

Garrick nods. Wil gets up and walks to the door.

GARRICK

See you tonight.

Wil turns and sees Garrick looking down at his desk and grinning. Wil leaves the room. He closes the door and sees that Nyx is waiting for him.

NYX

So how did it go?

WIL

The guy is a little weird.

NYX

He may be, but he knows what he's doing. I used to serve with him a lifetime ago. He's the best and will have us on the front lines making a difference. Come on, I'll take you to see Holt.

Later in the day, King Jared, Captain Manco, Captain Garrick, and other important figures are in attendance of the King's military meeting. Concurrent with the King's meeting, Wil and Nyx are in a field right outside of the castle walls during sunset. Wil is practicing his earth abilities in a field. Nyx, now able to move without a cane, is watching Wil practice and talking with him.

Back in the castle meeting room, King Jared addresses the room.

KING JARED

This is an ear-only meeting. Any interruptions will not be tolerated. All of my decisions are final. First, I would like to congratulate Captain Garrick on a successful defense of the Warduo citizens. He was able to protect us from the poisoned ones with minimal losses. Next, I am recognizing Wil, Senz, and Nyx on their bravery. Without them, the stellar defense would have been that much more difficult.

Outside of the castle, Wil is practicing and talking with Nyx. He is concerned with Nyx's pursuit of fighting and winning, so talks to her about the goal of peace.

WIL

I always hear you talking about fighting in the war, going to the best side to win the battles. But, don't you want peace?

NYX

What am I going to do with peace? I'll grow out of fighting eventually, and then I'll be ready to settle down. But until then, we're fighting bad people, protecting the good ones, and winning.

Back in the castle...

KING JARED

This leads me to my next point. In light of the multiple recent successful defenses led by Captain Garrick against our aggressors, I am tasking him with the offensive responsibilities and the attack of Castle Saxon in Sector B. I'd rather not wait for Queen Tresa to send more troops. Captain Manco's division will stay behind and protect the castle. After the takeover, Captain Garrick will move on to Castle Wyvern in Sector D and then Manco's army will assume the defensive responsibilities over Saxon Castle as well, since our biggest threats will no longer exist. During this time, Manco will oversee the construction of a new castle to serve as the central beacon for the entire land. Afterwards, we will annex the Castle of White Cliffs, at which time the construction of the central castle will be complete. The Pandita Gardens regime is our ally, so the war will be over. The time frame is four years. We will be quick and precise. The era of peace begins now. You are all dismissed.

The King exits the meeting room first, and then is followed by everyone else. Garrick is smiling, and is the last to leave the room.

Back outside of the castle...

WIL

Come on. Let's spar. Since you don't have an active power, we can use swords.

Nyx smiles.

NYX

You won't be able to beat me yet. But if you wish to lose, let's go.

Wil and Nyx start to sword fight. She draws out two smaller swords, while Wil unsheathes his. She throws one sword at the ground by Wil's feet. He jumps back and the sword sticks into the ground. Nyx runs at him and swings her sword with her left hand. Wil blocks the swing. Nyx grabs the sword in the ground with her right hand, and swings at Wil's leg. He jumps in the air and kicks down at the flat part of the blade, knocking the sword from Nyx's hand. Nyx kicks him in the stomach and Wil stumbles back. She picks up the sword and they continue trading swings which the other blocks. Nyx gains the upper hand on Wil and with the hilt of her sword, knocks him to the ground. She kicks his sword from his hands and swings down with both of her swords at the same time. Wil teleports to the back of Nyx, bumping her and causing her to fall to the ground.

NYX

Hey! That was cheap! No powers.

WIL

Sorry, that was unexpected. Besides, I thought you were a great soldier that is ready for anything.

NYX

It was a sword fight, strictly. Who gave you that power?

WIL

Nobody.

NYX

I thought you were just an earth mover.

Wil smiles.

WIL

I can also use other people's powers. I don't quite have control ov--

Nyx makes two fast movements with her sword and cuts Wil twice on the arm.

WIL

Owww. What are you doing?! The practice is over.

NYX

Payback, I would have won anyway; I'm faster than you. Now watch me.

Nyx hovers her fingers over one of the cuts and slowly heals it.

NYX

You try it with the other one.

Wil tries, but nothing happens.

NYX

This isn't like your other powers. You need to completely relax.

Wil tries again, and somewhat succeeds. The cut closes a little, but the scar is still there. Nyx heals the scar fully.

NYX

I guess you really can use other powers. Good. Heal yourself from now on.

WIL

I don't need to go blind.

NYX

You won't.

WIL

You did after you healed me.

NYX

You won't go blind. When you master that power you'll be close to invincible. My eyes are like this for another reason.

WIL

Something else you forgot to tell me?

Nyx pauses and thinks.

NYX

My father had me on the battlefield at an early age. I learned how to fight and heal, very fast. One day the Eclipsilon appeared for the captain of our army. Melantha, I think her name was. She had warned the captain previously not to go there. But he continued to venture into the White Cliffs Mountains anyway. She was about to kill the captain, when my father stepped in the way to defend him.

WIL

He seems too young but was the captain, Garrick?

NYX

No, I joined him later.

Nyx continues with her story.

NYX

She put a curse on Dad for interfering, which affected his whole family; everyone would eventually go blind. After that, she paralyzed him. I charged toward her knowing I didn't stand a chance and she knocked me aside easily. She asked if anyone else wanted to interfere, and everyone just stood there. Melantha was sick. She poisoned the captain and had him attack Dad.

Nyx has tears rolling from her eyes, but doesn't cry. She continues her story.

NYX

He didn't have a chance. I couldn't move and I think she was holding me in place with her powers, so I couldn't help. All I could do was stare at that witch. I stared so hard at her. The next thing I remember was seeing my father lying still on the ground. The troops were all gone, and so was Melantha. My eyes had already started to dim. I went to Uncle Durriken's house to live after that. He was more powerful than anyone. He was also going blind, but taught me how to see in other ways. I thought that he would help and avenge his brother's death. But when he heard that Eclipsilon was involved, he went crazy. He said he would never help. He would just care for himself, and me if I chose to live there. I lived with him for a year, but I couldn't sit around without helping. So I left, moving to and from different battles.

Nyx wipes the tears from her face.

WIL

What do you know about the Eclipsilon?

NYX

Durriken wouldn't tell me. From what I've gathered, they're a group of people who rarely show themselves, while attempting to control everything. And when they do appear, bodies are left behind.

WIL

An Eclipsilon guy named Deacon killed Balin. But it sounded like Balin was working for them.

NYX

If uncle had joined the war, it could have ended. This could be over by now! Balin wouldn't be involved in this business.

WIL

Your uncle, that's right. I met Durriken when I first left--

NYX

Don't even talk about him. He's not worth it and I can't stand him. He should have joined the war to prevent disasters from happening to more families. Dad's death was in vain.

WIL

Your dad's death wasn't in vain, you're here. But, Balin said that Durriken sent him.

NYX

I hope he was just lying so you would trust him. If he joined the Eclipsilon--

They sit in silence for a few minutes. Garrick walks up to them.

GARRICK

So, there you are. I've been looking for you two. The king has spoken. We are on the offensive for the Saxon Castle battle.

Nyx looks at Wil, as if to say I told you so.

GARRICK

You will both be in control of different sections of the army. Senz will be with me.

WIL

I've never controlled or even been a part of an army before. I don't know where to start.

GARRICK

With my planning, that won't matter. We will succeed. Just use your instincts if you get in trouble.

WIL

I spoke with Queen Tresa when I was at the castle and she offered me a position upon my return.

GARRICK

That's good to know. I will devise a plan and we will mobilize tomorrow, beginning the attack in two days time. Good night.

Garrick returns to the castle.

WIL

I guess it's time for me to retire too. You coming?

NYX

I'll be there later.

Wil walks back into the castle. Nyx stays lying on the ground, looking up at the stars.

## The Day Before

The sun is rising and light spreads across the land and into the castle. In the castle barracks and courtyard, the newly appointed offensive army is finishing their preparations to move out. Back in Garrick's office, he is sitting at his desk, talking to Wil, Nyx, and Senz. He is showing his strategy on a map while talking to them.

GARRICK

These are the finalized plans. Wil, you will go early, before dawn, and tell the Queen that an attack is coming from the north. The Queen will send some soldiers with you, to prevent the attack. Your division will be waiting to ambush those troops. You will then return to attack the castle with your division. Nyx, you will lead your own division and attack the castle at dawn, where Wil will join you. After the frontal attack begins, the main division will attack from the rear of the castle. Senz, you will be with me as second in command. Congratulations.

Senz smiles and then nods in approval.

GARRICK

If anything happens to me, or if I need to deal with other business, you have full command over the army. After seeing you handle the spawn, and getting to know you over the past few days, I am sure that you will capably handle this task. Is this understood by everyone?

Wil, Nyx, and Senz all acknowledge Garrick.

GARRICK

We will storm the castle and leave no route for escape. Wil, after your division arrives you will need to move as fast as you can to Queen Tresa's chambers. You are tasked with defeating her. Questions?

WIL

I still haven't mastered my powers yet. How do you expect me to defeat the Queen? She seems powerful, and I don't even know what she looks like.

GARRICK

Nobody does except for Dina, the general for her army. But you will figure out a way. We give you our confidence, keep it.

WIL

And how do--

GARRICK

I have never been wrong about anyone. You will figure it out. Any more questions?

Wil and Senz shake their head no. Nyx doesn't make any gestures.

GARRICK

Good. Be ready to move out immediately and get into your proper locations. In exactly six days, everyone will be in position. After a one day rest, Wil, you will go to the Queen in the early morning of the eighth day. Leave your division to the north and join Nyx for the previous night. Then go to the castle from that direction. By dawn, both of you should be attacking the castle. The main division will attack shortly thereafter. We will go over the particulars while traveling. Let's go.

They all leave the office and join the rest of the army. All of the preparations are complete and everyone leaves Warduo Castle and heads toward Saxon Castle.

Seven days pass and each division of the army is in position. Wil arrives at Nyx's camp site. There are soldiers milling around and their spirits are much higher than when Wil was around the mercenary army. Nyx is outside of her tent, heating a pot of soup over a fire. The two of them enter Nyx's tent to talk in private.

WIL

So, do you think this plan's going to work?

NYX

No doubt about it. Garrick got his failures out of the way in the past. That's one of the reasons why I left him. I saw his potential but he couldn't get over the hill. Now that he's reached that potential, nobody can stop us. I don't like that Senz is one step away from commanding the entire army though. But if Garrick trusts him, I probably should give him a chance.

WIL

Well he did save my life, along with you. I'm just so ready to get started! I don't think that I'll be able to sleep; this is what I've been waiting for. Over the past few days I've gotten so much better with my abilities too. And since the others are comfortable with Uniques, I could train openly. I even sparred with some of the other soldiers. I'm finding that I'm a quick study.

He grins.

WIL

Some people might even say I'm almost unstoppable.

NYX

You definitely need to rest. Also your abilities will be at full strength. And you'll need to be at your best with all of your powers if you're expected to succeed.

WIL

I'll just heal myself if I get into trouble. I've been practicing that, too.

NYX

There's no way that you've gotten good enough to heal yourself in the middle of a battle.

WIL

That won't matter. I'm great with my earth powers. I won't get hit.

Wil smiles.

NYX (sarcastically)

Good. I've always wanted to serve with the perfect soldier.

Nyx smiles slightly.

NYX

Just keep a healthy level confidence and then you'll be unbeatable.

WIL

Has Garrick really never been wrong about people?

NYX

His strategy hasn't always been perfect, but his judgment of people has. Peace will be here faster than everyone thinks.

Nyx leaves the tent and brings back a bowl of the soup that is heating over the fire.

NYX

Here you go.

She gives the soup to Wil. Wil takes a deep whiff of the soup and has a few spoonfuls.

WIL

Wow. This smells and tastes so good. Something else that you didn't tell me? You're an elite cook, too......

Wil's speech trails off and he starts to pass out, falling backward.

NYX

That was fast. Maybe I used too much bire seed.

The land comes up to meet Wil's back and continues to meet his body as he falls back. Nyx watches in amazement as the slope appears. Wil is sleeping on the slope of land.

NYX

Maybe you are a fast learner. You will definitely be ready. You're starting to merge with the earth. And now you'll be rested and fully powered.

Night passes and the early morning has arrived. The sun has yet to rise.

NYX

Wil, wake up. It's time for you to leave.

When Wil awakens the dirt slope disappears back into the ground. Wil catches himself from falling completely. He looks at Nyx.

WIL

You put me to sleep?

Nyx nods. Wil smiles.

WIL

Thank you.

Wil leaves the tent and Nyx follows behind. Holt is curled on the ground and turns his head to look at Wil.

WIL

Holt, it's time to go.

Holt gets on his hind legs and spreads his wings. Wil gets on Holt and rides away. Nyx yells after him.

NYX

Guard yourself!

WIL

You too!

Wil travels to Saxon Castle.

## A Time to Ride

Saxon Castle looks more grim than Wil remembers it, as the low and setting moon casts weird shadows. Wil rides up to the castle gate, and talks to one of the two sentries outside of Saxon Castle.

WIL

I need to speak with Queen Tresa immediately. She is expecting me and this is urgent. My name is Wil.

SENTRY 145

Yes, she alerted me to expect you. But this is not a proper hour.

WIL

You didn't hear me? This is urgent.

Sentry 145 hesitates.

SENTRY 145

Wait here. I will go speak with Lady Dina.

WIL

I need to go with you then. Time can't be wasted.

Sentry 145 nods and leads Wil into the castle. They arrive at Dina's room. The sentry knocks on the door.

DINA

Who is it at this time?

SENTRY 145 (meekly)

This is Sentry 145, my lady, and Wil has arrived to--

WIL

I have returned according to Queen Tresa's wishes, and bring news of Warduo's counterattack plans.

DINA

1-4-5, return to your post. Wil, wait for me outside of Queen Tresa's chamber.

The sentry returns to the front of the castle and Wil goes to the Queen's chamber. Dina arrives very quickly.

DINA

Wait here while Queen Tresa prepares herself.

Dina enters the Queen's chamber.

DINA

Lady Tresa, I am sorry to disturb you at this hour. Wil has returned with information from Warduo. He wishes to speak with you.

QUEEN TRESA

Let him in.

Dina brings Wil into the Queen's chamber, leaving Holt outside.

QUEEN TRESA

What do you have to tell me?

WIL

Captain Cailan proved unworthy of his title and led us to defeat against Warduo. I was captured and overheard the plans of their offensive army. I've developed my Unique abilities and was able to escape. They are sending the army from the north, instead of the direct path. If we leave now, I can lead you to their targeted staging position and we can ambush them.

QUEEN TRESA

I am unsure of the reliability of this information.

WIL

I --

QUEEN TRESA

Dina, accompany Wil and Captain JERL's army to the site. You have full authority. Slow down the attack while we prepare here.

DINA

Yes, ma'am.

Dina and Wil exit the Queen's chamber and go to meet Captain Jerl.

DINA

I was alerted that now is the time for me to defect. Whatever you have planned, I am now a part of it.

WIL

And how can I trust you? I'm leading you to the opposition and you're trying to set me up.

DINA

When the time comes I will help. I am a Unique and I can harden my body to make it impenetrable. With that to accompany my strength, I am a formidable enemy... or ally. I can take out Jerl when the time comes. It will be easier to destroy his troops without their captain.

WIL

If you say so. But I won't betray the Queen.

The army is gathered and led out of the castle toward the ambush site. The sun is just starting to break the horizon as they arrive. The area is filled with hills and a narrow passageway.

WIL

The spot is a little further.

Dina positions herself slightly behind and at an angle to Jerl. Wil takes off on Holt as fast as he can, and then stops at a good distance and turns around.

JERL

RETREAT!

DINA

Keep your current formation! Queen's order.

The troops do not retreat and keep the course. Jerl looks back in disgust at Dina.

WIL

NOW!

Wil's division surrounds Jerl's troops. Dina knocks Jerl unconscious, causing him to fall off of his horse. Dina rides over to join Wil, whose soldiers attack Captain Jerl's troops. Some arrows fly at Dina. They hit her, causing some arrows to break, while others deflect off of her.

DINA

You're not going to join your troops?

WIL

Not part of the plan. I need to be at full strength when I face the queen.

DINA

I can go back to the castle ahead of you and keep her unsuspecting about the situation.

WIL

That sounds good.

Dina starts to leave.

WIL

WAIT! I almost forgot. What's the queen's ability?

DINA

Her strength. She also loves spiders and is weakened by light. Good luck.

Dina goes back to the castle. While she returns, some of Jerl's troops try to attack her. She hardens again to prevent damage. A battle ensues as Wil watches from a distance. Arrows from his troops rain over in the first wave of the attack. Troops emerge from seemingly everywhere to quickly overwhelm Jerl's troops. Wil's division of the army is victorious and doesn't suffer any casualties. Wil gathers his troops together. He looks toward the sun and then back at the soldiers.

WIL

Good job. We're running late, so we need to hurry to the castle. Let's move.

Wil takes off on Holt quickly, leading his men to the castle.

Nyx leads her division to attack the castle. She looks in the direction that Wil is supposed to be coming from, but sees no one. She continues with the attack anyway. The Saxon troops are waiting outside the front of the castle. A battle starts and the Saxon forces soon overpower Nyx's division.

Wil is seen running from a distance toward the battle. While he is still riding Holt, he sees that Nyx's army is getting overpowered. He closes his eyes and concentrates. Rock spikes shoot out of the ground underneath some of the Saxon troops, who are spread out on the battlefield. Nyx's division regains equal footing with the opposing forces. Wil's division breaks apart and joins the battle. Six soldiers stay with Wil and escort him to the castle. The group of soldiers surrounds him in a circular formation. Wil slows down a little to stay in the middle. More troops flood out of Saxon Castle. Wil and his escorts continue to go to the castle.

WIL

Continue through. We'll make it.

Two of the escorting troops get knocked down and Wil takes notice.

WIL

Break apart, now!

The troops spread out and join the fight. Some of the Saxon soldiers go after and attack the escorts, while most converge on Wil. Holt grows and knocks them to the ground with his wings and escapes out of the group. Wil is no longer seen on Holt's back.

Inside the castle, Wil appears from thin air, running through an empty hallway leading to the Queen's chamber.

WIL

I hope I have enough energy left.

At the castle's rear, Garrick's division is waiting. Two archers step to the front, and the back gate is in view. There are two guards on the inside and two on the outside. The two archers pull out two arrows each. They let their arrows fly at the four guards, making contact and causing them to slump to the ground. Garrick leads his army to the metal bar gate. He gets off of his horse and reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a shiny wire. Garrick holds the wire with one hand and grabs the end of the wire through the gate. He pulls the wire across two of the metal bars causing them to melt at the point of impact and fall to the ground. One of the archers slips through and raises the gate. The army floods into the castle.

GARRICK

Group Ce, spread yourselves out through the castle. No one is to leave. Group Te, join the battle upfront and surround their army.

Group Ce breaks apart and goes in many different directions in groups of two and three. Group Te, the bigger group and led by Senz, remain together and move quickly to the front of the castle. On the way to the front, they attack the individual enemy troops they pass by.

At the front of the castle, the Warduo troops are dwindling down and getting pushed back. Nyx is visibly worried. Group Te of Garrick's army exits the front of the castle, to flank the enemy. Nyx yells out to her troops.

NYX

Keep pressing through! We can't lose!

The Warduo army is still outnumbered, but their strategy has turned the tide and they are beginning to overpower the Saxon troops. Nyx sees that they are inching closer to victory, as Senz masterfully commands the Warduo troops.

## Caught in the Web

Back inside of the castle, Wil arrives outside of Queen Tresa's chamber. The door crumbles at once, and turns to ash on the ground. Wil realizes Queen Tresa must know his plan and enters the chamber confidently.

WIL

It's over.

The room is still dark. Wil can't see if anyone is in the room. He creates an angled hole in the ceiling by using his powers to crumble that spot.

QUEEN TRESA

What do you think you're doing?

Wil looks closely and sees the Queen.

WIL

Uniting the land, saving the people... redecorating.

Wil creates many more angled holes in the ceiling. The light has filtered into the room. The Queen moves further back to one of the two dark places left in the room.

QUEEN TRESA

You're very predictable. Dina, get him.

Dina steps in front of Queen Tresa from out of the other dark area and looks at Wil. Dina takes a step to the side exposing the Queen. Wil acknowledges this and charges at the Queen. He launches some of the bricks from the floor at the Queen, continuing to charge. The Queen forms a glowing web with her hands. She launches the web at the flying bricks trapping them and carrying them back at Wil.

Wil slides to the floor on his stomach while continuing forward, to avoid the web. Wil's sword on his back gets knocked off by the web of bricks to the doorway of the room. Still sliding forward, the ground propels Wil upright and he grabs the Queen's wrists and holds her up. She is shorter than she appeared earlier.

WIL

I'm too quick.

QUEEN TRESA

No, just predictable.

Wil suddenly falls to the ground from the blow to the back of his head from Dina. Queen Tresa kicks Wil back to the front of the room. Wil gets up dazed and has some tiny spiders crawling over him. He swats the spiders off of him.

QUEEN TRESA

You expected it to be that easy. You're not worth my time. Dina will handle you while I regain control of my castle.

Queen Tresa grows taller and transforms into a human spider hybrid creature. She jumps out of the ceiling into the light. Wil looks at Dina.

WIL

I knew I shouldn't have trusted you.

DINA

You're zero for two. You shouldn't have trusted me, and you shouldn't have attacked us.

WIL

I don't have the time, so yours is also running out.

Wil picks his sword off of the ground and stares at Dina. He runs toward Dina and swings his sword at her. She grabs the blade of the sword with her hand. It doesn't cut into her at all.

DINA

Stupid.

Dina punches Wil in the stomach and kicks him back. Wil is able to hold onto his sword, but loses his breath. He stands back up.

WIL

This fight is over.

Wil charges Dina and swings his sword as hard as he can at her. She blocks with her arm, causing the sword to break. Dina swings a punch at Wil. Wil teleports behind her and places his hand over her eyes. He runs energy through her body from his fingertips. Her skin appears to crack like a rock.

Dina screams as she collapses to the ground. Her body slowly fades. Wil looks disturbed.

WIL (quietly)

I couldn't control it. I'm sorry.

Wil leaves the Queen's chamber. He sees some of the Warduo troops dead on the ground. Wil hops on Holt and rides to the front of the castle.

He exits the castle and sees Queen Tresa freezing some troops and throwing ice spikes from a distance, while Garrick is frantically commanding the troops. Queen Tresa is an even more bizarre mix of human and spider than before. She also has small spiders crawling all over her body. He jumps off of Holt and grabs a sword that is lying on the ground. Nobody is close to the Queen, so Wil raises the ground they are on. This forms a huge elevated circle, which isolates them from the armies.

WIL

Let's keep this between us.

Queen Tresa looks enraged.

QUEEN TRESA

I don't need to see them.

She continues to launch ice spikes. Wil walks toward Queen Tresa, throwing rocks at her. She stops launching ice.

QUEEN TRESA

Your confidence will kill you.

WIL

Not today.

QUEEN TRESA

You're correct, I will.

Queen Tresa launches ice spikes at Wil. He continues to walk up to her while the ice hits his body and just shatters.

QUEEN TRESA

So that explains Eclipsilon's interest in you. You're the fabled Unique able to possess any ability you choose. I always know how to control the people around me. Do you remember those spiders from my chamber?

Wil's walk slows down. He starts to shiver and his body begins to freeze. Queen Tresa extends her arms and freezes Wil completely in a thin layer of ice. She walks up to Wil and stares into her eyes.

QUEEN TRESA

Loser. What a waste of talent.

She places her hand on Wil's frozen chest. Spiders crawl off of her and onto Wil. Nyx and Garrick are scaling up the side of the platform on the back of Holt. The spiders start to burrow through the ice and bite Wil. Queen Tresa leans in close to his ear.

QUEEN TRESA (whisper)

How does that feel?

She takes the sword out of Wil's hand and with the tip, traces it over the body of Wil.

QUEEN TRESA

You joined the war to find peace? I can help you with that. This mound will be a fitting monument of my greatness on this day.

She raises her hands and lets out ice spikes in the air that come down around the platform. A couple of the spikes hit Holt and knock him down, off of the side. Garrick and Nyx jump off and Garrick stabs his sword into the side of the platform and grabs Nyx. He swings her up, and then she helps him up. Queen Tresa sees Garrick and Nyx.

QUEEN TRESA

You're just in time.

Queen Tresa lifts the sword with her right arm and starts to swing.

NYX

Noooo!

Unrefined red energy flies from Nyx's eyes and hits Queen Tresa in her right shoulder, injuring her badly. The spiders stay away from that area.

QUEEN TRESA

AHHHHHHHHH!

Queen Tresa drops the sword and falls to the floor in pain. Nyx stumbles back and looks dazed.

GARRICK

Nyx, focus that on Wil.

NYX

I don't know how.

GARRICK

If you don't, he's not going to make it. I'll hold her for as long as I can, but we need Wil to stop her.

Garrick turns invisible. Nyx tries but cannot unleash an attack. Queen Tresa gets up and sees that Nyx is trying to attack but cannot.

GARRICK (quietly)

Keep trying.

Garrick, who is invisible, runs up to Queen Tresa. She looks at Nyx.

QUEEN TRESA

William will pay for his failures and your poor aim.

Queen Tresa grabs the sword with her other hand. Garrick punches her in the face knocking her down. She swings her sword in the direction of Garrick as she falls, but misses. She stands up and some spiders crawl off of her and spread out sparingly around her. Queen Tresa speaks to nobody in particular.

QUEEN TRESA

You're delaying the inevitable.

Queen Tresa walks back up to Wil. Garrick tries to get closer to Queen Tresa for another attack. In doing so, he steps on one of the spiders. Queen Tresa hears it.

QUEEN TRESA

Got you!

She launches a web capturing Garrick and pinning him to the ground. He reappears and can only look up to the sky, and cannot turn his head in any direction. Queen Tresa looks at Nyx, who is still trying to use her blast ability.

QUEEN TRESA

Now you can watch both men in your life vanish.

Queen Tresa takes the sword in her left hand and swings at Wil. Nyx unleashes a blast that engulfs Wil. The blast leaves a scorched path and is powerful enough to kill Wil. The blast causes Nyx to fall back. She starts to feverishly rub her eyes. Queen Tresa's strike continues through where Wil was frozen, although he has teleported behind her. He takes the sword that Queen Tresa swung, from out of her hand, and in one smooth motion strikes her in the body through her side.

Queen Tresa slumps to the ground. Wil looks and smiles at Nyx, and then collapses. The web on Garrick fades away. Garrick stands up and runs toward Wil.

GARRICK

Nyx! Get over here fast!

NYX

I can't see or feel you.

Garrick runs to Nyx, and guides her to Wil.

GARRICK

He is suffering from the cold, but more from all of the spider bites. The poison is running through him fast.

Nyx places her hands on Wil and starts to heal him. Garrick backs up and looks at Queen Tresa's body.

Garrick walks up to her and removes the sword from her body. He then moves Queen Tresa so she is lying on her back. She turns her head to look at Garrick. She barely can speak.

QUEEN TRESA

I don't want to die.

Garrick takes out a small knife and stabs it into the queen's heart. He puts the knife away and lies on his back, next to Queen Tresa. Her fading body is drawn toward and into Garrick's body. He completely absorbs Queen Tresa. Nobody witnesses Garrick's actions. He gets up and returns to Nyx's side.

GARRICK

Is he going to make it?

NYX

It was close, but he should be fine.

GARRICK

Good.

Senz was able to lead the Warduo troops to victory over Saxon while Queen Tresa was being defeated.

Days pass by.

## One Step Closer

King Jared is speaking at a large castle ceremony. Garrick, Senz, Nyx, and Wil are sitting in a massive crowd and listening about the successful attack over Saxon.

WIL

Garrick, are you sure you're OK with Manco taking over Castle Saxon? We were the ones that won it.

GARRICK

I do not fight for the spoils of war. I fight for peace; the only thing worth dying for. We can continue to unify the rest of the land for King Jared.

King Jared continues to speak.

KING JARED

...and this is all thanks to one individual and his army. Sir Garrick Laurent, please step forward.

Garrick stands and walks up to the King. The crowd applauds.

KING JARED

Through Sir Garrick's brilliant strategy and amazing talents on the battlefield, Saxon fell in record time.

The crowd applauds some more. King Jared steps back to allow Garrick to speak.

GARRICK

Thank you for the praise. I should note that without the assistance of my top generals, this attack would have most certainly failed. Senz, Wil, and Nyx deserve much of the credit.

Senz, Wil, and Nyx stand and the crowd applauds. They sit back down.

GARRICK

King Jared's vision of uniting the land is shared by everyone throughout the region. This goal will be attained through the will of the people. Thank you.

The crowd applauds. Garrick steps back and King Jared moves forward.

KING JARED

This is the beginning of The Great Epoch. The times call for a celebration!

The band starts playing music and the celebration begins.
