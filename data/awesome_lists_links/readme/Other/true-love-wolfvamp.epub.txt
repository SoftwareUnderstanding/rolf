Chapter 1

"I can't believe my father made us go here," Monique said. Tiffany agreed. "Maybe it's not that bad; I mean they have a cheer leading team! We should try out!"

"Yea, I guess," Monique replied unsure, "but I'm going to check where my locker and classes are. Are you coming Tiffany," she asked. "No, not right now; I'm going to try out for the cheerleading team." Monique called out to Tiffany, saying good luck. In her mind she was saying the same thing...

Monique look around, seeing if anyone can show me the way to my classes. But, like always, nobody offers. So she was wandering around like an idiot, trying to get to my locker. I get pushed and shoved by these stupid, idiotic students like a piece of meat. Her eyes starting to turn red and her teeth were coming out. She tried to keep herself calm; she didn't want any of these humans to know that she a vampire.

Her vampire sense wanted her to rip these people to shreds. She wished that Tiffany were here to help her calm down; they always do things together, but she wanted to try out for the cheerleading team. Monique knew she would make it because of their vampire "abilities". Their "vampire abilities" help them run fast, have amazing flexibility, better sense of smell, and better hearing.
Chapter 2

Monique found her locker and opened it. When she turned around, there was a hot, amazing looking boy. she dropped her books. Some emo chick next to her said he so out of your league; he is the brother of the quarterback. "Sorry," she said, "my name Lexi, and you are..." Monique told her. She said, "I'm guessing you're new here".

"Yes," Monique replied, my friend Tiffany and I are, but she's trying out for cheerleading. "She better watch out for Courtney, she's the head cheerleader, Lexi warned, "she hates anybody that stands in her way, and, of course, her man Tony.

Well Courtney has these rules... Her idea is if one of the girls has talent, she becomes such good friends with them, then when it comes to prom, she says, "you're not pretty enough to become queen, so don't even put your name in the ballot"."Has she done that to you," Monique asked. "Nope but she did it to one of my friends; she made the cheerleading team then got all these great compliments from Courtney. She thought she was the most beautiful girl in school. Courtney made her believe these things.

"What happened to your friend," Monique asked curiously. Lexi replied emotionlessly, "She killed herself and hung herself in the bathroom at prom... "OMG" I said, "I'm so sorry!" "It's not your fault," said Lexi, "it's Courtney's. One second she made her feel so pretty then the next she shuts her down. "Courtney is a "Cruel" ,"Denial" , "Moron", "stupid", "cheerleader". She sounds like a..." "yeah I know" interrupted Lexi.
Chapter 3

Tiffany got to tryouts early to train and warm-up. She was watching the cheerleaders practice. They're really good. I hope I get in, she thought. She heard the cheer captain say, "Get in line if you're trying out!! I rush to get into line. "Hi everyone I'm Courtney. I'm the captain of this team. Before we get started, I want to tell you the rules. Rule #1, don't look at my boyfriend Tony; he's the quarterback of the football team. Rule #2, if I see u talking to him, you will be kicked off of the squad immediately. Rule #3, no talking back to me. What I say goes, is that clear?" A chorus of "yes's" and "it's clear" rang throughout the room. "Ok good so let's get started!!!" First up is Kim! Floor is all yours; let's see what you've got. Start the music and go.

"Wow Kim... that was... ugh, let's see... well I guess... NEXT!!! Next is Tiffany! Floor is all yours let's see what you've got. Start the music and go."

"Wow, impressive, you've got my vote! I'll post the names on the bulletin board first thing tomorrow. Good luck and I'll see you at tryouts."

Tiffany runs over to Courtney "Thank you for accepting me". "You're welcome, your so talented" Said Courtney. "You are so beautiful that I'm already accepting you to be one of us cheerleaders. I mean the girl in front of you she was so horrible her fashion taste of clothes is so disgusting. I'm not going to put her on the team she will make all of us look bad especially "ME". I mean come on did you see her clothes they were capital "AWFUL".

Tiffany just nods her head slowly she felt so mean. She thought that girl's clothes were really nice. But Courtney is such full of herself that she doesn't want anyone standing in her way. Tiffany really wanted to be on the team so she kept her mouth shut.

Chapter 4

Monique and Lexi looked at her classes. Lexi said, "hey we have all the same classes together!" In Monique's mind she was wishing that the good looking guy was in her class. Lexi said to her we better hurry up I don't want to be sitting in front with Mr. Spits. Monique was like whom? That's what I call Mr. Bone, he spits so much when he talks so let's get back seat Lexi said as she grabbed Monique's arm and rushed her to class. Lexi got her seat and was saving mine but soon as Monique got in BAM. She dropped her books and looked up. She saw that it was HIM! He said sorry, he was rushing. Monique quickly said me too LOL. Hey, aren't you new here? I'm Eric by the way, he said, shaking her hand. "Oh hi," she said, I'm Monique, nice to meet you. Eric said, "well we better sit down". She said, "yeah," and walked to her seat next to Lexi. Eric grabbed a seat next to her own and whispered in her ear, "good this seat was open I can't stand Mr. Bone and his spit LOL."

"I can't believe he is sitting next to me," said Monique. "I mean he choose me to talk to me; I'm not even the popular girl here". She always thought that popular guys would only talk to popular girls. Her guess was so off. She was glad Eric Sat by her; his blue eyes were so dreamy. Even is "biceps" were huge; She didn't think she'd be able to concentrate when he is sitting near her.

Eric probably goes for these big shot girls to be his girlfriend. He was so polite and mature than her ex; who was abusive. She was hoping she could be more than friends with Eric. That would be the best wish she would ever have. She look over at Lexi who was writing the notes on the board. She'd ask her after class if she could borrow her notes because she was in a "love trance" by Eric and his dreamy eyes...

Chapter 5

Ok everyone sit down said Mr. Bone. We are going to be starting a book called Romeo and Juliet. Lexi whispered to her, "finally something interesting for once". Ok class this is going to be a project please pick a partner and settle down. Lexi grabbed her arm OMG let's be partners!! Ok, she said. In her mind she wanted Eric to ask her to be his partner. Yo, Eric called, Tony be my partner man. Sure dude Eric said. Tony whispers to Eric you see the new girl on the cheerleading team? Eric says not really I have my eyes set for someone else. Well dude she hot her name Tiffany her best friend here.is Monique. That's the girl I like. Who man? Monique said Eric. Hey tony you already have a girlfriend though. Yeah about that can I tell you something? Yeah sure what is it? I'm going to dump her right before prom to ask Tiffany out nice huh??

Eric just gave a weird look back at Tony. "Really dude," said Eric. "Yeah" Courtney is a brat she is so demanding I can't stand her anymore. I seriously can't beloved she makes fun of all these people she is so immature. My honest opinion she is "Really ugly" and she shouldn't tell people they are when she should look in a mirror. I heard that she made that girl last year hang herself in the bathroom at prom. "Yeah I heard about that too" Said Eric. She is such a snob. She gets people to like her be best friends with them and then takes them down if they look prettier than her. Said Tony. If she doesn't win that crown she is going to flip and I want to see that said Tony. "Yeah that would be great".

"So how you going to get that girl Eric?" said Tony. With my awesome hotness, and my "lusting eyes". Tony was laughing don't forget your personality, and your co-captain on the football team. That girl will definitely say "yes" to you. Your my brother every girl would want to be yours you are "Popular" every girls dream is to become popular and that is her one way ticket.

Chapter 6

Tiffany ran to the bulletin board where Courtney posted the Cheerleaders that made tryouts. Tiffany scans the bulletin board for her name YES I made it. Courtney walks by me with her boyfriend tony. Great Job Girl you blew me away. Come sit with me at lunch today your one of us now. Ok I said. I started walking to my biology class. I walked in and saw Monique OMG I run over to her and we jump up and down. I told her I made tryouts. She like OMG good for you I knew you would you the best. Hey!! Lexi ran over to me. Oh Lexi this is my best friend Tiffany. Hey they both say. Do you know who the teacher is Tiffany and I say to Lexi? Lexi replies yeah its Mrs. Apple she is really nice I heard she gives everybody A+.Wow I'm starting to really like her.

Hi class I'm Mrs. Apple and... Sorry were late Mrs. Apple Eric and Tony run in. Mrs. Apple says it's alright but if it happens again you both have detention. Courtney walked in with a late pass sorry Mrs. Apple I was at the nurse. It's fine Courtney, please take a seat she sits right next to her boyfriend. So Class like I was saying Welcome to Biology. Let me tell you my rules for my class. Rules #1 do not be late for my class you only get one warning or you will have Detention. Rule#2 No talking while I am talking or you will be kicked out.

Ok Just one more thing I had to tell you guys after this class anyone who is getting a dorm please go to the information desk and they will assign you a dorm. Well class I'll see you tomorrow with your papers signed.
Chapter 7

We all rushed out of the classroom to get in line for dorms. Wow there was a huge line Tiffany, Lexi and I said. Lexi said I hope we get to be in the same dorm together. When we got up to the desk the lady asked for are names we said Monique, Tiffany and Lexi. She says please fill out these papers gave us a clip board and we sat down filling in the paper. We got back up gave the paper to the lady and she printed out a paper with are dorm number on it she gave us are room key and a map how to get there. Lexi said first can we get something to eat I'm hungry we both agreed.

We got in to the cafeteria and got are food and sat and ate outside in the court yard. Right beside us sat Courtney, Tony and Eric. Tiffany looked over and saw Courtney and Tony making out. Then she went back talking to Lexi. I looked over to look at the scenery but noticed I was being watched by Eric. I kind of felt bad for him he was talking to nobody at the table so I gave a hand wave to come sit over here. He nodded and got up and sat next to me.

Hey how were your classes? I said great I saw you run in to Mrs. Apple's class today. Lol Yeah we were running late slept in lol. So what dorm number did you get? Umm let me check #7 and you? I got #9 I'm sharing it with Tony. Courtney right next to us she got #8. She paid more to get a room by herself. Oh wow really lol. I guess she is in the middle of both of us then said Monique. I think so said Eric. Hey Eric Lexi and tiffany both say. Hey Eric said how are you guys how was your day at school? Lexi says Great. Tiffany says awesome I'll made the cheerleading team and you? My day was good but it got better when I got to talk to you Monique... AHH Totally blushing right now.

There was an amazing dinner on a table set and prepared. I felt like the luckiest girl alive. Hey beautiful said Eric he kissed me slowly on my lip. I returned the favor and kissed him back. So Eric said I prepared dinner for us... Next thing I knew I had my legs wrapped around his waist kissing him and falling on the bed. He put his teeth in my neck and marked me as his. I cuddled in bed next to him. Now for dinner said Eric lol I made Pasta.. "My favorite" said Monique. Let me just go fix myself. Monique walks in the bathroom and fixes her hair and puts her make up on. I look in the Mirror and saw the mark it was a paw...

Hi Gorgeous Sam said he kissed her passionately.. He brings her inside his cabin and puts her on his bed and gets under the covers and makes out with her... I love you Sam said Tiffany and Sam put his teeth in her neck and marked her with a paw print. Tiffany woke up and she was still cuddling with her Mate Sam. Tiffany looked at the time and she saw it was 5:00. She ran out of bed and got ready for the party at 6:30....

Sam woke up in bed and was wondering where Tiffany went to he could still smell her scent in bed. Sam saw Tiffany coming out of the bathroom with her hair wet from taking a shower. Hey where you going Tiffany ? The party at 6:30 REMEMBER??!! OH MAN said Sam he rushed out of bed and got dressed. Tiffany had a red short dress on and her hair up in a bun. Sam called the rest of the pack to come over because the limo will be here. Everyone from the pack was at Sam's cabin waiting for the limo to show up. The limo showed up and everyone got in and we were on are way to the party.

We all got there and we got into the club and saw the Fangs were here. Tyler and Mark were waiting at the bar. Tyler runs over with Mark to Eric. Let's fight man I want my woman back she better with me. I don't think so said Monique. What do you mean I don't think so said Tyler??? Well Monique said I'm marked as Eric's Mate and only his so you coming here was a complete mistake. So if I were you I would go back where you came from and leave us alone this is are club.

Tiffany runs up and punches Tyler across his face "you jerk"! Said Tiffany. Tyler holds on to Tiffany's neck... Sam comes barging through and knocks Tyler to the ground and starts punching him and kicking him don't ever touch my Mate again!! Mark jumps on to Sam's back.. Eric comes charging through when he sees a bruise on his mates face he turns to wolf and attacks Tyler and Mark....

Courtney and Lexi run over asking is Monique ok?? "No" said Tiffany she can't get up her leg is broken from falling down. We need to get her to a doctor, and you too Tiffany "said" Lexi. Eric and Sam run back over to us. Are you girls ok? "Said" Eric. "No" Lexi said. Monique has a broken leg and Tiffany's neck is all bruised up. Next thing I knew Eric picked me up and ran fast speed to the hospital Sam did the same thing with Tiffany.

Hi welcome to mating hospital how may I help you? Hi my mate broke her leg and she needs help. Ok sir please fill out these forms and a doctor will be with you shortly. For the meantime put your mate in the wheel chair over there to rest her leg. Thank you very much said Eric. Eric picked up Monique and put her in the wheel chair while he fills out the papers. Sam walks up my mate needs a doctor she has bruises on her neck from being strangled at a party by her ex. Omg sign these papers a doctor will be with you shortly. Thank you. A nurse comes walking over to us is there a Monique ? Yes that's me said Monique. Hi I'm Cassie I'm the nurse and I'll be taking u to room 7 will be taking your blood pressure etc. Hey Eric.

I'll be back with your cast and another question do you want a wheel cheer or crutches? Can she have both? Eric said. "Yes" she may say Doctor Pie. Well here is your receipt he hands it to Eric you can pay at the front desk.

Doctor Pie puts on my cast and puts me in the wheel chair for now because I'm still weak. Eric takes me home. Tiffany and Sam are still in the waiting room. The nurse comes over to them here is the cream to put on the bruise around your neck. Take it three times a day."OK Said Tiffany.

The next day, when everyone else was at school, Monique was in bed resting her leg. She was on the computer looking for prom dresses. She found the perfect dress but she had to go to the store to get it. Monique got her crutches and got into her pink convertible and went to the mall. I put on my black cast boot on my leg so I could walk with out my crutches. On my way to the mall I picked up Tiffany. "Hey" Tiffany said should we be doing this. I mean were supposed to be resting because of are injuries... "Yeah so" Said Monique we are preparing for prom lets go...

Eric And Sam get home from school noticing there mates aren't there. Courtney runs in saying they went to the mall to get prom dresses they text me telling me to tell you guys. Sam says I'm driving ! Eric hops in with Courtney in the front sit with her brother. Courtney gets out and runs into the mall, "Found THEM!!" Eric and Sam run to her and hug there mates. Why did you guys leave?? Monique spoke up I wanted to get prepared for prom. And I wanted Tiffany to come along..

Well you should be resting so for tomorrow please rest don't go anywhere Said Sam and Eric. "OK" Tiffany and Monique said. Tiffany and Monique went back to the cabins and slept for the rest of the day. Monique felt this long hand wrap around her waist when she was sleeping. She turned around and saw Eric looking into her hazel beautiful eyes. Gm "beautiful," said Eric. I thought you were going to school said Monique. I would rather be with you knowing you are safe than getting me worried like yesterday.

******************************

Tiffany woke up smelling this amazing smell from the kitchen. She hopped out of bed and ran to the kitchen seeing her mate Sam cooking breakfast for her. Sam heard her come in he turned and put the hot pancakes on the table and kisses her on the lips. GM sweetheart. What are you doing here ??!! "You are supposed to be in school" said Tiffany. I took the day out to keep you safe and I wanted it to be special when you woke up. Aww I'm sorry if I yelled at you she kisses him on the lips thank you for being here for me I really appreciate it. I love you Sam. I love you too Tiffany.

Next day at school Tiffany and Monique come back. Mr.Bones welcomes them back to class and tells them they have a new project to do. The project is on love. "That's easy" Tiffany and Monique screamed. "That's what you think" Courtney and Lexi say. "Why are you saying that" Tiffany and Monique said. Well because we have the same project for health class but health class is on abortion, sex and etc. We have to make a survey on one with are partners. When did we get put into health class??!! Tiffany and Monique say. "They put us in it yesterday" said Lexi. Its a requirement said Courtney to pass for this year.

The bell rang for lunch Eric,Tony,Sam and Evan ran for the food. Tiffany,Monique,Lexi and Courtney walked to the salad line. "Men are pigs" Lexi yelled. "I know right" said Courtney, Tiffany and Monique. Courtney tells Monique there is a Talent show you should sing your really good you saved are butts at the football game the other day. "Yeah you should" Tiffany and Lexi say. The boys run over next to us with a plate full of food. Eric says "What you guys talking about"?. He kisses Monique. "Get a room you guys"! Sam says. "We already have one are dorm" lol said Eric. "Come on you guys we have to go to health we don't want to be late lol" Lexi says.

(HEALTH SECTION )

We all walked into to Health class and we saw this amazing, stunning Hot teacher. We were definitely going to love this class.. We didn't care if are mates were late we were just staring at our teacher... Lexi raised her hand asking what his name was. He said my name is Mr.Cool. Any other questions ladies? The boys run in and take there seats. Monique raised her hand "How old are you Mr. cool?" I'm 20. Any other questions before we get started??Courtney asks "Are you single"? Mr.Cool says "yes I am". We could hear growls behind us from are mates. OK "Well lets get Health started shall we"? said Mr.Cool. Lets watch a movie about young teenagers that are pregnant. After this movie is over will have a discussion about it. Monique,Tiffany,Lexi and Courtney were trying to watch the movie but there eyes were focused on Mr.Cool.. The boys saw them looking over and growled MINE to Mr.Cool.. Well that's all for now I'll see u next class and we can discuss the movie.

We all walk back to are cars. Courtney,Lexi,Eric,Tony and Evan get in there cars and drive back to there cabin in the woods. While Monique and Tiffany go to are dorms. I say to Tiffany I forgot my books in health class. I run inside the school and into health class and grab my books. I turn around and bump into Mr.Cool. "Hi" Mr. Cool sorry I had to get my books. I could smell you and Tiffany across the room you two aren't wolves your vampires... "Your point"?? Said Monique. "I'm a vampire too" said Mr.Cool. Then why are you here Scott?? So you do know me then Monique. "Yes" your my fathers guard. So why are you here? I'm here to find my "Luna"... said Scott. Well you arn't going to find her here said Monique. I already found her...

So what do you guys think ?? Who is Scott's Luna? Scotts Pic>>

************************************************************************************************************

WHAT??!! Monique yelled. Who?? That blonde girl whats her name oh right Courtney. She smells nice.. I want to bite my teeth into her neck. "You will never ever go near her!" Said Monique. You can't stop me I saw her eyes glaring at me and drooling she couldn't take her eyes off me. In 1 month she will be MINE!!.

Monique runs back to her dorm to see Tiffany on her computer. "Whats wrong" said Tiffany. Scott is Mr. Cool and he came here to find his "Luna". "OMG" Said Tiffany who is it?? It's Courtney.. He wants to make her his in 1 month. We cant let him do that he is "EVIL". My father fired him for a reason."What did Scott do"? Said Tiffany. He tried to kill my father for the throne. "OMG" he is "Evil" Said Tiffany. We got to go tell the others grab your stuff and let's go...

********************************************************************************************************

We got to the cabins and it looked liked they were all near the bonfire. So Tiffany and I told them are teacher Mr. Cool is named Scott and he used to be my father's guard. He wants to make Courtney his in 1 month. We can't let him do that he is "EVIL". My father fired him for a reason. He tried to kill my father for the throne. "OMG" they all say. Sam steps in no ONE will touch my sister they will have to go through me first.

Next day at school we walk in to health class. Mr. Cool said "Good morning Class". We will be watching another movie about pregnancy. But first I'm going to hand out paper work from the last movie. You will be graded. And your time starts NOW!! While we were taking are test Monique saw "Scott" looking up and down at Courtney like she was a "piece of meat". Monique raised her hand to get his attention to her. "Yes Monique," said Mr. Cool. I'm done. Mr. Cool walks over and takes Monique's paper and goes to his desk to correct it. He gives my paper back he gives me a B and put beautiful for Tyler ;) "Excuse me!!" Said Monique. "Yes"? said Mr. Cool. This is indeed very inappropriate. My Mate is Eric not this Loser!! Mr.Cool comes up to me and whispers in my ear "not for long". "What did he mean by that?"Said Monique in her head. "What is he up to"??

He gives Courtney back her paper and it says A on it and including "My Luna" with hearts around it. Courtney shows the paper to Tony. Tony goes on a rampage and throws his desk at Mr. Cool. You will never go near her she is mine. Sam read the paper and runs over to Mr. Cool and punches him in the face. NEVER EVER Touch or talk to my sister or I'll rip you to threads!! The principle walked in and had to restrain Tony and Sam.

They both had to be sent to the principal's office to get long term detention and 4 days out of school for what they did. The Principle came in to Mr.Cool's classroom and I'm so sorry about are two students I have a nurse coming in to check out your face if you please come with me I'll take you to her.

Mr.Cool follows him. "What have they done" Said Monique,Tiffany,Lexi and Courtney. Courtney text Sam and asked him what's happening? ~Sam's Text~ We got long term detention and 4 days out of school for what we did. Courtney shows her text to Monique,Tiffany and Lexi. "OMG" Said Monique, Tiffany, and Lexi.
Chapter 11

Scott Pov

I will make her my "Luna". I will kill every man that goes near her and tear them to threads. But wait that man she is with is a werewolf... Hmm I'll get my other pack Tyler and Mark...

Tyler Pov

"What do you want Scott"? I have a deal for you.. Said Scott. "What is it then I'm listening". If you help me get my "Luna" I'll make sure that u get yours. And I know who it is Monique. Hmm you know I am in for MY GIRL. "Splendid" said Scott.

Mark's POV

"What do you want Scott"? I have a deal for you.. Said Scott. "What is it then I'm listening". If you help me get my "Luna" I'll make sure that you get yours. And I know who it is Tiffany. You got your self a deal said Mark. "Splendid" said Scott.

************************************************************************************************************

Tyler And Mark POV

"Man what a deal that was" said Tyler. "Yeah" Mark says. I wonder what Scott has planned...

Scott's POV

My plan is for Tyler and Mark to distract Tony and then once that happens they all will come to help Tony and I can grab Courtney and MAKE HER MINE MUAHAHA!!! He tells Tyler and Mark They love the idea. They already hate us they wouldn't know what hit them .....

Monique POV And Tiffany POV

We have to know what Scott is up to Said Monique. "So what is are plan" said Tiffany? My plan is to know who he is helping him. Scott knows me more from my father I will go in and "Make" him tell me if that doesn't work your turn Tiffany to do your plan. "Ok" Said Tiffany. So my plan is I'm thinking like Scott he would probably ask Tyler or Mark. Remember what he put on your paper. "OMG" Tiffany you're a genius! He was probably giving us a clue!! Yes i remember (He gave my paper back and he gives me a B and put's beautiful for Tyler ;) )

So should we just go with my plan said Tiffany?

Chapter 12 Fight

"Lets go!" Monique and Tiffany put there hands together and raised it up high. They went into Mr.Cool's Health Class together, and Monique walked up to Mr.Cool.

"Can I have a word with you after class?" Said Monique.

"Sure" Said Mr.Cool.

Monique sat right next to Tiffany, Courtney, Lexi, and Eric. Monique told Courtney, and the rest the plan, they loved it.

"We should definitely do Monique's plan first then Tiffany" said Eric.

They all agree.

"Anything to get that creep off my back..." Said Courtney

"Ok, students everyone get out your notebooks and pencils." Said Mr.Cool. "We are going to be learning about abusive relationships."

Tiffany and Monique laugh quietly.

"Yeah he is the abusive one." Said Monique

"I know right?" said Courtney.

"Anything important you wanna tell the class ladies?" Said Mr.Cool.

"Yes, actually I do" said Courtney. "Your a creep and a weirdo, I will never be your Luna!" Said Courtney.

"I could see on Mr.Cool's face that we upset him a lot" Said Monique.

"Oh yeah BINGO" Said Lexi.

The bell finally rings for lunch, they ran out and got their lunch. Monique goes off to talk to Mr.Cool.

"Hey, Mr.Cool I was wondering what you are up to because you have set your eyes out to Courtney."

Mr. Cool Grunted and responded "Why would I tell you?"

"Well," Said Monique "You did give me a clue yesterday on my paper I know you are using Tyler and Mark to your advantage but I don't know why."

"Clever girl" Said Mr.Cool, "But I'm not telling you so move along and go eat your lunch."

"I'll see you back here after lunch" Monique Responded.

"Bye now." Said Mr.Cool, flabbergasted.

"So," Said Tiffany,Courtney,Lexi and Eric. "What did he say?"

"He said, I'm not telling you so move along and go eat your lunch." Said Monique, imitating Mr.Cool's deep voice. "I'll see you back here after lunch, bye now"

"Wow, what a jerk!" Tiffany said. Tiffany phone started to ring, she picked up, and said "Hello?"

"We got a problem" Said Sam on the other end of the call. "Tyler and Mark are here and there waiting for someone."

"Oh my god!" Said Monique, "That's his plan he knows you guys will fight them and he will have advantage to take Courtney away!"

What are we going to do then?" said Courtney.

"Well we are going to get Eric to go look for Scott and Sam and Tony will fight them. Tiffany, Lexi and I will protect you Courtney will be in are cabin. Like the plan so far?" Said Monique.

"yes we love it " Said Courtney and company.

**********************************************************************************************************

"Lets go!" Said Monique.

They all went back to health class. Mr.Cool was just on his computer waiting for us.

"Welcome Back class" Mr.Cool said as the class started inside, he stood up, referencing the board. "Lets get back to abusive relationships. The first signs of a abusive and needy relationship are on the board. Please copy these down in your notes." He motioned twords the board, which said in his sloppy chalk hand-script:

EXTREME JEALOUSY,

CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR,

QUICK INVOLVEMENT,

UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS,

ISOLATION BLAMES OTHERS FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AND FEELINGS

"Has Everyone written down those notes?" Said Mr.Cool, "Next chapter is on Warning signs of a abusive relationship." Mr.Cool turned his attention to the board, erasing the first bits of notes, annoyed groans come from the class. Mr. Cool's stick of chalk squeaks and creaks as he scribbles down more notes onto the board, finally finising, Mr. Cool turns twords the class. "Please write down these notes, and check in the book for other refrences."

Checking your cell phone or email without permission.

Constantly putting you down.

Physically hurting you in any way.

Telling you what to do.

*********************************************************************************************************

"Next notes are What is Abuse?" Mr.Cool gruffly said.

Abuse can be physical, emotional, or sexual. Physical abuse means any form of violence such as hitting, punching, pulling hair, and kicking. Abuse can occur in both dating relationships and friendships. "Hmm" interesting said Tiffany it sounds like Mr.Cool.

Has everyone got the notes will be having a quiz for this. So be "Prepared" Said Mr.Cool. *Bell Rang School over* We all rushed out of our seats and ran to are car's and got to are cabin and doing are plan.Eric go look for Scott and Sam and Tony will fight Tyler and Mark.

Monique and Tiffany sing beggin on your knees!! THIS IS FOR YOU TYLER AND MARK FOR CHEATING ON US YOU DESERVE TO DIE!!

Tyler I wanted to say thank you for what you have done so me and Tiffany want to sing this song.

Tyler and Mark were about to charge at us but Tony and Sam got there before thay could all i could hear was ripping,growl and screaming. Next thing me and Tiffany saw was blood on the ground and parts out of the body of Tyler and Mark.

"What a relief!" both Monique and Tiffany Said. Tony and Sam run to us. Were going to help Eric! Were coming to said Monique and Tiffany. "Where is my sister?" said Sam. "She is with Lexi in the cabin all the doors and Windows are locked. "Tony go stay with my sister and Lexi I'll take the girls with me to take on Scott with Eric.

"Hello" were you looking for me said Scott. Eric says "yes" your "henchman" are dead you are all alone give up and go home. If not I will have to kill you. It's a kill/ Live situation. "Pick one" said Eric. I want my "LUNA" so I'll stay and fight for her. Fine your choice good I have back up to kill you more said Eric. Sam,Monique and Tiffany come in and fight.

The fight begins with Scott and Monique. Vampire VS Vampire. This is for trying to steal my father's thrown. Monique throws a punch in Scott's face.He catches my arm . I kick him in his "spot" and kick him in his chest he goes flying through the grass. Scott comes back up in vampire speed. We fight with puches, kicking and throwing. None of us are going to give up. My eyes turn deep red and my fangs come out I've had enough of this....

"Oh God" Tiffany says when her eyes get like that she cant stop. "ERIC YOU GOT TO HELP HER!!" Said Tiffany. Sam asks what is happening to you Tiffany? I'm turning my vampire is telling me I have to help her she is a sister to me. Sam sees Tiffany turning her eyes turn deep red same thing as Monique. Her fangs grow out and she speeds through with Monique and charge at Scott together punching,kicking,biting. Monique does back flips aiming for Scott's head .

"Scott is geting stronger!!" Said Monique. Next thing I knew he flies us to the ground and he is gone... "NO!!" Said Monique and Tiffany! Eric and Sam tried to run after him but he disappeared. Eric pulled Monique away we gotta go to school we are going to be late. Sam did the same thing for Tiffany. we all were on away to the cabins and Courtney and Lexi were geting in the car to head for school. We all hopped in.

We got to school and went to our first class that was health class. Surprisingly Scott wasnt there. The principle walked in and said that Mr.Cool quit. And he said your new teacher is Mrs.Love. Mrs.Love said "Good Morning Class". I hear there is a School Prom. That must be exciting."Yes it will be" Said Courtney I already have my outfit picked out. "Thats amazing can I see"? Said Mrs.Love. "yeah Mrs.Love" Said Courtney. Courtney shows her dress to Mrs.Love. "Wow" that's amazing you will look beautiful in it said Mrs.Love. "Thank you" Said Courtney.

"Well class" said Mrs.Love. It's my first day so will just learn about each other who wants to go first? Courtney was the first one to raise her hand. "Well" Courtney tell me about your self. "Well" I'm Courtney and I'm 18 and I love fashion. I'm head cheerleader of the football team. Everyone always come to me for fashion advice because they want to look good. "Well thank you Courtney". There were only a few claps because Courtney is very full of her self. "Next" Said Mrs.Love. Tiffany raised her hand. "Hi" I'm Tiffany and I'm 18 I'm a cheerleader at mating high school. And I don't care about fashion. I love my look and I don't need anyone to change that she stares at Courtney. My dress is so pretty look Mrs.Love. "Wow that is amazing". I started walking to my sit and I got tripped by Courtney she whispers in my ear don't you ever humilate me ever again. Or you will be kicked off the squad!! Monique rises up from her sit and tells Mrs.Love about her. "Hi" My name is Monique and I'm 18 years old I love to sing. Monique walks back to her seat but before she does that. If you ever threatened my friend again I would have Scott take you away with him. So don't temp me you know I will.

"OK" last but not least Eric? Said Mrs.Love. "Hi" My name is Eric and I am 19 and I'm on the football team. "OK" Well that's the end of class I'll see you guys tonight at the prom.
Chapter 13

"Come on Monique" said Tiffany I wanna see your dress!! Monique comes out with a pink dress. (see pic). "OMG MONIQUE YOU LOOK HOTT" Said Tiffany. You are definitely going to win prom queen. "No" Tiffany you are your way prettier than me and your cheerleader" Said Monique. "Stop thinking bad about your self you are beautiful the way you are Eric knows he loves you". I know but I don't know.. if i can win. Courtney barges in with her purple dress. I overheard what you were saying and "DEFINITELY NO" you aren't going to be queen. I'm always queen of the prom and Tony is always the king. So don't even put your name in the ballot "NO ONE" will vote for you. Goodbye ladies I'm late for my limo.

Monique looks out the window and sees Courtney getting in the limo with Tony. "I hope she gets dumped on that stage that will make my day" said Tiffany and Monique. I see Eric coming up the steps with Sam with a bouquet of flowers. I see mine there pink. Tiffany's were red. "Wow" said Eric your so beautiful. "Wow you are so beautiful" Said Sam. "Thank you" Tiffany and I said. We all hold hands and walk to are limo. Eric popped the cork on the sparkling wine. The wine went everywhere in the limo. We all were laughing our heads off. The limo driver said we are hitting some bad traffic so good you called me early.

Tiffany and I take lots of pictures and put it on are FaceBabe. We start jamming out to kesha new song "Die Young". "Were almost there" said are limo driver. "Were Here" said the driver text me when you need to be picked up. "OK" both Tiffany and I said we got are table put are stuff on are seats. We started dancing on the floor grinding are mates. Eric whispered in Monique's ear I voted for you to be queen. "Me Too" Said Sam "Me three lol" said Tiffany. "Really you guys" thank you so much but Courtney said "NO ONE" will vote for me. "Who cares what my sister thinks" Said Sam. She is a drama queen. We aren't supposed to tell you this but Tony is going to dump her on stage. "YES" Monique Said my wish came true!

"Hi boys and girls this is Mrs.Love" I've been chosen to pick the prom king and Queen. So if you havent voted yet this is the time now. "OK" Are King and Queen is.... ERIC AND MONIQUE!! "WHAT??!! "yelled Courtney. Courtney runs up on the stage "THAT CROWN IS SUPPOSED TO BE MINE I'M HEAD CHEERLEADER "! "NOT THAT LOSER I'M MORE PRETTY THAN HER!! Said Courtney. Courtney pushes Mrs. Love on the ground and takes the crown.

"See I look so much prettier than her". Sam runs up to the stage and puts Courtney's hands behind her back. "Eric" take the crown Sam says. "NO ITS MINE!!" Says Courtney. Eric takes the crown and puts it on Monique's head. "You are beautiful don't listen what Courtney says she is full of herself. "Thank you Monique kisses Eric on the lips.

The principle comes over with two cops. For your behavior Courtney you are kicked from the squad and you will be going to a psychotic institute. You are banned from ever coming back here. "Police take her away" Said the principle. "You cant Kick me from the squad I'm the best !!" "No ONE will Replace me!!" Your replacement is "Tiffany" Said the Principle. "NO SHE NOT GOOD ENOUGH I AM ARGH!!!!!" "Get her out of my site" Said the Principle.

Courtney wasn't done yet she punched one of the cops in the gut and ran for Monique for her crown and Tiffany for taking team captain of the cheerleaders. One of the cops tazered her five times for her to be on the ground. One of the cops handcuffed her and threw her in the back of the psycho bus. In my head I knew we wern't done she wanted revenge and she was going to get it one way or another... "Well if i wasn't interrupted" Lets have the King and Queen have there first Dance. "Shake your BUTT" said Tiffany.

Monique starts "crumping" like this Tiffany lol. Eric goes with it and puts his hands on my waist. Tiffany and Sam joined in. Tony grabs the shy girl from are English class Tina and dances with her.

"Thats the end of the song" Eric whispers in my ear. Go dance he smacks my butt "SHAKE THAT THING GIRL". I laugh out loud.

Eric walks out and sees it has been pouring out and gives his jacket to Monique so her hair wouldn't get ruined. Sam, Evan and, Tony do the same thing to there mates.

Are limo driver stoped right in front of the gates to the school, and walked around to open the door. We all got in to are limo and heard on the radio "Born This Way". We started bumping eachother on are way to are cabins to the song. We get to are cabins and Monique,Tiffany,Lexi and Tina head to the bathroom to change out of are dresses to are sleeping outfits.

Monique chooses her pink gown with her red silky robe. Tiffany chooses her purple gown with her purple silky robe. Lexi picks out her black gown with her black lacy devil robe. Tina picks out her blue gown with her green robe.

Eric,Tony,Evan, and Sam run into the bathroom to change there clothes to there sleeping wear. (Which is there boxers). Eric changes in his pink boxers with breast cancer on it. Tony changes in to his green boxers. Evan changes in to his black boxers with death skulls on it. Sam changes in his purple boxers with martini's on it.

Tiffany and Monique were hungry so they went into the woods to look for something to eat. While Lexi and Tina waited in the cabin for the boys to come over for their "sleepover".The boys knocked on the door and they were let in by Lexi and Tina. Sam and Eric were wondering where Monique and Tiffany were. Lexi said they were hungry so they went to get food. "Yeah animal blood" Said Tony lol.

"What's wrong" Tiffany Said. Monique says " I think I'm pregnant..." "OMG" That's amazing Said Tiffany. Why are you so down? I just want my baby to be normal not a vampire like me I dont want her to eat how we are.... "Maybe" says Tiffany she like Eric a werewolf. "Yeah I hope" Said Monique.

Monique says maybe you should get checked too.. "OK" Said Tiffany.Tiffany and Monique head back to the cabin but they get in Monique's red convertible and head to the hospital.

ERIC AND SAM'S POV:

I looked out the window and saw Tiffany and Monique head into the car and drove off. What were they doing we had a sleepover. "Where do they think their going?" Said Sam and Eric. Sam said come on Lexi,Tony, and Tina were going for a ride. "Where we going said Lexi?" Were following Monique and Tiffany they just hopped in their car and drove away without telling us where there going. "HURRY" Said Eric. We all hop in to Eric's Jeep and follow Tiffany and Monique.

Tiffany and Monique were almost near the hospital when Monique looked in her rear view mirror and saw ERIC's Jeep. "OMG" Said Monique. "What Said Tiffany" "Look who is behind us" Said Monique. "OH BOY" Said Tiffany. We park are car in the hospital parking lot and ran inside. The lady at the front desk said "Can I help you ladies?" I could see her name tag said Sandy. So Monique said "Yes Sandy". I think I'm pregnant said Monique and I think my friend here Tiffany is to.

"OK" Well I'll need you to fill out these papers and then come back with them and a doctor will be with you shortly. "OK Thank You Sandy" Tiffany and I Said. Tiffany and I handed are signed papers to Sandy. We waited for are doctor."Hi" I'm Lucy and I'm your doctor if you too will come with me I'll take you to your room. Monique you will be in room 7. And Tiffany you will be in Room 8. I have to go get the nurse so she can check out your blood pressure and then I'll be right back.

"Excuse me" Said Sam and Eric to Sandy are mates just came here and we were wondering why? "Oh" you mean Monique and Tiffany? "Yes". They came in to see if there pregnant. Eric and Sam dropped to the floor. Good tony was right behind them to catch there fall. "THEY'RE PREGNANT??!!" Said Sam and Eric. "I'm going to be a DADDY!!" Said Sam and Eric.

The Nurse comes in Monique's room first and takes her blood pressure. The Nurse says your blood pressure is fine. Then the nurse walks over to Tiffany's room and takes her blood pressure. Nurse says your blood pressure is fine. She told us both to lay down and wait for the doctor but first she put this gel on are bellies. Doctor.Lisa came into Monique's room.

"Sam" Said Eric. "Yeah man" Said Sam. "GOOD LUCK" Said Eric.

"Thanks man I think I will need it. Said Sam

Sam heads on his way to the Psycho Institute. He stops at the gate where there are too guards. One guard comes up to Sam's window and asks "Who are you here for?" Sam said Courtney. "Come on in." The other guard presses the button and the gate opens and Sam drives in and park's his car. Sam locks his car and walks up to the building, he walks to the front desk where this lady in white is on her computer. He walks up to her and said "I'm here to see my sister Courtney..." The lady pressed this button on her desk and called someone to come and take me to Courtney.

I see this big man with huge muscles come up to me and said "Follow me." I followed him into the visiting room and he says "Sit any where you like and I'll go and get her." He comes back with my sister handcuffed and dressed in a white cloth and sat her down in the sit. And went to the door and stood right in front of it. Courtney says "Sam you came to get me out of here?" "No you belong in here what you did to everyone at school. Courtney says" Well they are all jealous of me and they don't have the looks like I do. And my crown which Monique took from me and Tiffany who took head cheerleader of the school from me. "I didn't do anything wrong". "You killed that girl last year you made her hang her!" Screamed Sam. "You are all to blame" Said Sam. "Puh-lease that girl got what she wanted popularity I gave it to her but when she started getting better than me I had to take her down, she deserved that," Said Courtney. "You made a really nice girl kill her self for your actions what you said to her made her feel bad." "You don't even care" Said Sam.

" Your right brother I don't because I am way better than these people". "I don't deserve to be here I deserve to be pampered". Said Courtney. And when I'm out of here I and Tony will live Happily EVER AFTER!" "Yeah about that ... Tony dumped you he going out with Tina." Said Sam. "WHAT??!! THAT LITTLE UGH" Said Courtney" When I get out of here she is the first I will kill for taking MY MAN" Said Courtney. In your dreams sis she will be protected by us and by the way your not in are pack any more. Eric has become Alpha and we all discussed it that you are forbidden to be in are territory. "You can't do this Sam I'm your sister".

"Not any More you aren't once your kicked out you are not my sister." "Fine when I get out of this place I will make my own pack and my pack will kill YOU". "Whatever sis you're never getting out of here this is where YOU belong" Said Sam. "You are a CRAZY,UGLY,CRUEL PERSON I HAVE EVER KNOWN AND I HOPE YOU DIE!!" Said Sam. "You don't mean that I'm the most nicest, BEAUTIFUL PERSON EVER!!!" Said Courtney.

"Courtney you're so full of yourself" Said Sam. "Your always a Brat and I hope you get what u deserve. Sam walks away and nods at the man near the door and let's him out. Courtney tries running after him but lands in the big staff guy. He picks her up and brings her to the therapy room to talk to Mrs. Haul. He straps her to the seat so she won't run away and goes to stand by the door letting Mrs. Haul in.

Mrs. Haul sits down at her desks and takes out Courtney's file and starts skimming through the pages. "So how have you been?" Asked Mrs. Haul. "Horrible if I was out of this stupid place I would be better" Said Courtney. "I'm sorry but you're staying here for the rest of your life. In your records it says you got a girl to kill herself by hanging herself in the bathroom at your prom last year and you told her she was not "pretty".

"Am I correct"? "Yes" Said Courtney. She was taking over my spot so I had to I'm more beautiful than her she can't steal my popularity. "Hmm tell me more Courtney". Well the girl had no taste in fashion so in my head I wanted to help her if she was going to be in the cheerleading team. But then she fame higher than me in everything so I had to take her down. I told everyone in the school to laugh at her, throw stuff at her, and tell her she ugly and pathetic.

The day of prom my planned work I went straight up to her and said your off the squad your to ugly for this team get off my territory. "Is there anything else you want to tell me"? There is this girl who stole my man and she is going to pay when I get out of here she will be ripped to shreds with a chainsaw!"

And Tiffany stole my head cheerleading spot that's not hers. I worked so hard to get there and be #1 in completion. Well I want her to drink lots of water and to have two tablets. She hands the guy her medicine. And tells him to go with her to the cafeteria and feed her I don't want her touching any utensils that will harm us all. "OK Said the guy in white will do".

He takes Courtney to the lunch room and ties her handcuffs to the chair that is plastered to the ground and heads off to get her food. He puts her food in front of her and on her plate was chicken, peas, corn, chocolate cake, Jell-o and French fries. Some of it was for the staff. Courtney yelled "I'm a BIG GIRL I CAN FEED MY SELF!!" The man says "I'm sorry little lady but no can do you are here because you are psycho. And you are a murderer so we want to "pamper" you and keep you safe from hurting yourself or others."

"This is not "pampering" this is ABUSE!" Said Courtney. "I order you to unhand-cuff me!!! Said Courtney. The guy picked up his walkie-talkie and said we need more guys in the cafeteria Courtney has gone whack bring the taser! Then 4 or 5 guys come in with a blind fold and a wrap to put all around her so she can't move. One of the men tasered her 10 times to put her down and throw her in the big box. Where there aren't any windows or doors.

Courtney wakes up saying "Hello someone get me OUT OF HERE!! I need to go to the bathroom!! And take a shower. I'm beautiful I can't be in here!! "GET ME OUT OF HERE I AM ORDERING YOU TO COME HERE NOW!! I CAN'T BE TREATED LIKE THIS!! Courtney tries biting her self out of the white cloth. Dr. Haul was behind the glass which you can't see writing down all her behaviors on her laptop. She was trying to figure out what was wrong with her. Why had she done all these things?

Even MURDERED a girl. "I don't think she hung her self I think she killed her" Said Dr. Haul. The way she acts she wants to be the only attention. She doesn't want anybody standing in her way. Dr. Haul asks one of her supervisor's to get a background check on Courtney. The supervisor said "OK Ma'am right away". The supervisor came back with reports saying... that her parents died from being in a car crash. The girl in the picture which was Courtney picking up her mother's locket on the ground. Seems to me said Dr. Haul that she had some grief and she wants to be like her mother. Dr. Haul said her supervisor I don't think your seeing it correctly that girl is holding a knife... Dr. Haul said let me see.. OMG you are right this girl killed her mother and father but why on earth would she do that. Could you call her brother Sam in I want to know if he knows. "Yes Ma'am right away". Sam walks in to the conference room waiting for Courtney who he really didn't want to talk to. Courtney comes in with Dr. Haul and the big guy.

We all sit down and Dr. Haul asks me do you know what happen to your mother and father? Sam says "All I know is that they died in a car crash." Dr Haul hands me an old newspaper. She says do you see anything out of the ordinary. I saw Courtney holding a... What is she holding? Dr. Haul said she is holding a knife. Sam charges at Courtney and slams her against the wall what did you do??!! The big guy was going to tear them apart but Dr. Haul said let them she will tell him. Courtney laughs. "OK FINE I KILLED THEM ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?? Sam slams her back into the wall "WHY?" "I wanted to be like mom she was so beautiful I did everything to look like her. People were starting to notice me and I had to get rid of her so I took my bike got a knife from the garage and followed them to the nightclub. But I ran my bike in front of the car they swerved and hit the side bank. But they weren't "DEAD" so when they started limping to the tree I started stabbing IT FELT SO GOOD TO SEE THEM DEAD!! Their bodies laying there helpless. The last thing Mom said to me was "WHY". I said because I'm you and I look like you there should be only one me so you have to die. And then I got on my bike and got home and took a shower and went down stairs to play with you. Then you turned on the tv and saw mom and dad and we both cried. "YOU MURDERER" YOU KILLED MOM AND DAD!!"
