#  Focus & Mindset Is Key to Success

As you know the internet is overloaded with so much information that it is distracting many people and they just grab every course that promises to make money but they are still nowhere. Is this because all the courses offered by internet gurus are junk? No, certainly not; it is only because they don't focus on one thing.

What is Focus?

Focus is the ability to stay on track and keeping the goals in mind. It is very important for the success in any business whether it is online or offline.

It is important that you stay focused because I want you to be with your family all the time and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars like everyone else. But it is only possible when your life is organized. Unless your life is organized, you cannot stay focused to your task.

**H** **ow to** **F** **ocus?**

I always write down my priorities on a piece of paper and try my best to achieve the written goals. Writing my tasks help me in determining the less or more important tasks. This way I know exactly which project or task need to be done first and which one is next.

Writing a task on a piece of paper helps in tracking your progress. The best way is to write down everything you want to do. Then cross the tasks which you think are unnecessary and can waste your time. Sort each one priority wise once your task list is final. After you are done sorting you will see which projects you want to do first.

Do a valuation of time to be spent on each project and write it in front of every project. Keep the paper all the time in front of your eyes. In my case I stick it to the sides of my LCD Screen. This way I stay on track and never get distracted by anything.

You need to stick to it and do what you have written. Promise yourself that you will do it and remind that promise to yourself whenever you feel like distracting.

Sometime we will feel so lost and overloaded by the information that we do lots of things at once but if we look at the end result we are actually completing none of them. If you are feeling the same you can try these exercises for focus and building a positive mindset. They are not only simple but also work very well.

**F** **ocus E** **x** **erc** **i** **se**

Whenever you feel lost you can stop doing anything and ask these two questions from yourself.

  * What are my priorities in order to achieve success online?

  * Am I focusing on unnecessary things, if yes then how do I get rid of them?

Now those are the questions which will make your life if answered in a practical manner. You have got the priorities so it's time to write them down and make some rules for yourself in daily life.

**P** **os** **i** **t** **i** **ve M** **i** **ndset**

Having a positive mindset is the most powerful as well as very important tool for an Internet Marketer. Positive thinking, visualization and affirmation help us in getting, any high achieving goal. It helps us to transform our lives and our self believe gets stronger and stronger.

A positive mindset helps in developing a powerful and positive attitude which is of course an essential part of the future success. We can easily our turn the past failures into present and future success.

Whenever negative thoughts enter your mind, you can print these affirmations and read first thing in the morning and when you are going to sleep.

  * I'm A Genius And I Use My Wisdom Daily.

  * I'm Persistent and Make It Happen Whatever It Takes.

  * If They Can Do It, I Can Obviously And Easily Do It.

  * I Create My Own Success.

  * I Can Attract All the Wealth And Opportunity.

  * Money Comes To Me Easily And From Numerous Ways.

So, those were few things which are essential for anyone. If you get them in your everyday life trust me you will see the happiest time of your life soon. You will see the positive impacts on your personality and business.

#  What is Kindle & Kindle Publishing?

So what exactly is the "Kindle?" The Kindle is a revolutionary electronic- paper media reader that provides a sharp, high-resolution screen that looks and reads like real paper. Other companies have tried to enter the digital media reader market in the past with limited success. What makes Amazon's Kindle different is its ease of use, instantly accessible content and its real "book" like look and feel. It's like a book with a small computer wrapped around it.

With this Amazon Kindle, what you will be doing is providing content in the form of digital books and reports to the millions of current and future Kindle users. You'll earn a commission when one of your digital books is bought and downloaded by a Kindle user. And the best part is, once you do the work to get your books uploaded to your Kindle store, they'll be there indefinitely -- earning you commissions for years to come.

In this book, you're going to learn how you can partner with one of the giants of Internet commerce, Amazon, to sell digital content to their growing Kindle User base.

#  Why Do You Want To Get Into Kindle Publishing?

This is an important question and one I would ask you take a moment to ponder. Why this out of the thousands upon thousands of ways to make money online? Do you want to become an author/publisher?

Is it because you have a passion for books and reading? Is it because you want to be a successful and respected author? Is it because you think having a successful publishing business is exactly the right business for you?

Or is it because you think you can make some fast, easy money uploading a few e-books to KDP, hoping enough readers scoop them up so you can make rent before something better comes along?

Unfortunately most people pick that last one. And it's because of that I made this book. I actually swore to my friends I was out of the "info product" game for good. After cranking out over 50 books and started making decent money with it, I promised I'd never actually sit down and layout the process. But I have to. You see there is so much garbage information floating around right now it's clogging the system and is making it hard for legitimate authors and publishers to flourish. It's gotten so bad I feel it's my duty and obligation to at least attempt to repair some of the damage.

Can you make money with Kindle? Oh yes. There are plenty of people making healthy 5 and 6 figure monthly incomes doing this. In the grand scheme of things success in this business can be fast and easy. Much easier than any other form of online business I've ever seen. But there's a "catch".

To become successful and to not be wiped off the map you must care about your readers and about your titles (which are your books you are uploading to Amazon Kindle). You MUST care about quality. What Amazon provided for us with their KDP Self publishing platform the single greatest opportunity the world has ever seen since the birth of the internet?

But it will all vanish in a puff of smoke if people do not care about quality and only seek to milk what they can while they can.

**Be Forew** **a** **rned:** While this book you are about to discover can generate a phenomenal income for you and your family, you must treat it with respect and care. You are about to see a never before shared, 100% legitimate, long-term business which can be quickly set up and easily sustained for many, many years. However, if you act without regard for your readers or the ever evolving ecosystem known as KDP, your hopes of riches will turn to ash and you will fail. This I promise.

On a lighter note... at the end of the day it's actually easier to work with this book rather than trying to game it and stay 1 step ahead of the ax man. Since I started publishing this way none of my titles have been "slapped", I've seen a dramatic decrease in my expenses along with a HUGE boost in my monthly income. You'll see why in just a few minutes.

Note: If you're selling e-book on any topic on Amazon then follow the 2 advices.

**#1: No Aff** **i** **l** **i** **ate** **L** **i** **n** **k** **s**

Why? Because it's direct violation of Amazon terms of service. Having affiliate links in books has not yet become a big issue with Amazon but don't ever try to do it because they will either terminate your account or will block your e-books. Amazon uses readers as their eyes and ears all the time for market research. How do you think they knew about all the junk PLR (Private Label Right e-book which are available for few cents and every second person is uploading such content to Amazon and Amazon has kicked them out by terminating their accounts? If nobody complained they would not have cared and we'd all be gleefully uploading the 11,987th copy of "How To Lose Weight By Juicing Naked" written in 1999 by someone back when he needed the money to pay his rent.

**#2: Stop** **S** **e** **l** **li** **n** **g** **1st** **D** **raf** **t** **s**

If you're going to sell books you need to make them good books! They don't have to be great books, they don't have to change the world... they just have to be Good books people want to read and will enjoy.

If your books are not edited, not well formatted according to formatting policy of Amazon and filled with errors, Amazon will pull them and you'll get slapped.

They're doing it already in other markets and your books could be next if you don't follow the advice.

#  How To Succeed In A HUGE Way With Kindle Publishing

Stop asking "what books are selling?" It's not the correct question. Well, it is a good question, but it's not the one you need to be asking first. The correct question to ask first is:

**Why do read** **er** **s buy b** **o** **oks?**

When you flip the question out of being all about the book and instead make it all about the reader you can see how the equation changes. It forces you to realize there are living, breathing people at the end of those devices and they have needs, wants and desires. This single starting question now changes the entire landscape of your kindle publishing business in the most simple, yet profound of ways.

When you begin with "why do readers buy books" you then must follow up with questions like "why do readers keep buying books?" and "What sort of titles are they buying?" and most importantly: "What can I produce that will make them come back for more?"

You see? We need to begin with the human element and work backwards from there. Let's break some of these down...

**Q: Why Do Readers** **Buy B** **o** **o** **k** **s?**

A: In over half the cases most readers buy to escape. Reading is a form of entertainment for most people. Those who buy and read religiously do so because it simply makes them feel better!

In other cases readers buy books to figure out how to solve a specific problem they're having. Another simple reason is to expand their knowledge about a subject they find interesting. As simple as these three reasons sound, they are fundamentally powerful and will shape how we operate from here on out.

**Q: Why Do Readers** **KE** **E** **P** **Bu** **y** **ing Boo** **k** **s?**

A: This is vital to your success... Readers keep buying books because the initial purchase/reading experience was a pleasant one. They keep buying because that author was able to satisfy their needs and like a sex addict, they are crawling back, drooling for more.

**Q: What Sort Of B** **o** **o** **k** **s Are They Bu** **y** **i** **n** **g?**

A: If the answer is "escape" then they're probably scooping up all manner of Fiction and entertaining Nonfiction. This is why books on Celebrities can often sell like hotcakes.

If they have a problem to solve then they're more than likely scooping up tons of books on the subject.

An important fact to note is that people looking to solve a problem or expand knowledge will often purchase many, many books on the subject all at the same time.

**Q: How Can My G** **o** **a** **l** **s And In** **t** **er** **e** **sts Be** **Leve** **ra** **ged** **T** **o Se** **r** **v** **i** **ce The** **M** **ar** **k** **et?**

A: Just like any marketing exercise if you are going to be personally involved with the creating of these books it is vital you have an interest in the subjects. This is the point where you should jot down 5 - 10 different subjects you have an active interest in or you have researched (research the market will be discussed in the coming chapters).

From here we start to narrow down our potential quality entry point to the market.

Do you want to create Fiction? If so what sort: Fantasy? Sci-Fi? Mystery? Romance? Paranormal?

Do you want to create Nonfiction? If so do you want to help people move towards a solution or away from a problem?

Towards A Solution: How To Make Money Online? Away From A Problem: How To Stop Sweating?

The reason you want to better define this is because while you can create books in each direction, there is a very different psychology behind the buyers decision to purchase.

**Q: What Can I P** **r** **o** **duce Th** **a** **t W** **i** **ll Ma** **k** **e Them** **C** **o** **m** **e Back** **F** **or** **M** **or** **e** **?**

A: After discussing all important questions, we need to look inwards and see what your personal goals are for becoming a publisher. This question is best answered with a healthy combination of what you like and what is selling (what's already selling is part of market research and will be discussed in the next chapters)...

So for all that... let's go to next chapters.

#  Market Research – Amazon Research Method

**M** **ost** **I** **m** **porta** **n** **t:**

While researching the market, you need to keep in mind that you have to create e-books in series of 2, 3, 4 or whatever you like. I normally publish my books in a series of 3 to 4 books and then publish all of them together on Amazon and once they go live then take the links of the book and add these links in all books of the series at the end in the ABOUT AUTHOR portion of the book. This way when the customer or user likes my book which he/she completes, he/she can read my other books by just clicking on the links at the end of this book and I also increase my profits. So let's dive right into market research.

We want to break through and get our e-book to really sell. Once that happens, new options open up for you. You can jump to a different type of book, you can create a new series of books, and you can create a sequel to your first book.

So we want to emulate books that are already selling well. We want to write a genre book. That means if Thrillers are selling well, we are going to write a Thriller. If Teen Vampire books are taking over the planet, we are going to create a Teen Vampire book.

Of course, you are going to put your own special mark and style in your genre book. But we need to have that one book that breaks through and gets attention. Getting sales gives you options. Let's go on over to Amazon and see what's selling like hotcakes.

We see the usual suspects doing well. Crime, Mystery, Thrillers, War. We also know that Vampire books are taking over people's minds and wallets. Dig down into these different genres and pick one that you can write about. There is already a huge, built in audience for these books.

Amazon doesn't have its own keyword search tool that will tell us how many searches a particular keyword phrase gets in the Amazon or Kindle Store. However, Amazon does give us some tools that will allow us to deduce which niche markets are most profitable (and which ones to avoid). Let's look at these tools.

If you go to the Amazon home page at http://www.amazon.com you'll see a search bar at the top.

Click the drop down box and select Kindle Store. This will restrict any search made to only items that are in the Kindle Store.

Next, enter a search into the search bar. Pay attention to what's happening while you type.

Notice that Amazon is suggesting keyword terms.

Notice anything interesting about the order of the suggestions?

They're not in alphabetical order. "Improve eyesight" should be the first alphabetically but it's last. If they're not alphabetical what order are they in? There has to be some logic to how the results are being displayed. Amazon isn't the type of company to leave something like this to chance.

I think Amazon is telling us which keyword phrases are the most popular searches.

Now, this doesn't necessarily mean the keywords are leading to e-book sales... just that a lot of people are searching for these keywords.

Notice Amazon only returns ten results. You can get more results by entering a space and a letter after the initial search phrase.

You can do this from a – z however you won't get results for every letter.

Let's look at one of the suggestions Amazon is giving us: improve your photography

That's not a keyword phrase I would think a lot of people are searching. Let's see what the

Google Keyword tool has to say about that phrase:

I selected both broad and exact match types. Exact match means people are typing in the exact phrase, "improve your photography" in that exact order and with no other words.

Broad match means people are typing in the words, "improve" and "your" and "photography" but not necessarily in that order and possibly with additional words.

So 91 people per month search for "improve your photography" in all of Google every month? That doesn't sound like a very good niche does it?

But Amazon is telling us it's a keyword term that gets a lot of searches (at least a lot of searches compared to other "improve" type keywords.)

Which is correct? Probably both are correct in their respective universes.

There probably aren't a lot of people using the search phrase: "improve your photography" in Google. People search Google for information. If you were looking for free information to improve your photography skills which keyword terms would you use in your search? Maybe one of these phrases:

How to take good pictures

Photography tips

How to improve my photography skills

Photography lessons

Photography classes

Now let's take a closer look at the search phrase in Amazon:

Note there are only 12 results. Also note the Related Searches: jim harmer. That's the name of the Author of the first six e-books that show in the results. And that's the answer to the question of why people search Amazon for the keyword phrase: improve your photography. It's a book title. Actually it's a whole series of books in the same niche and by the same author.

People come to Amazon to look for products (especially books and e-books) they want to buy.

They bypass Google entirely because...

**They Alre** **a** **dy K** **n** **o** **w** **Where** **t** **o Go** **t** **o Fi** **n** **d the** **P** **roduct They Want** **T** **o Pur** **c** **ha** **s** **e!!!**

Sorry for shouting but that is an important point and I want to make sure you get it: People come to Amazon to Buy.

Incidentally, Jim Harmer OWNS the "Improve Your Photography" niche on Amazon. It's not a niche you would want to compete in.

Now another important tool Amazon gives us is Best Sellers Rank. According to Amazon "Best Sellers Rank" is calculated every hour for every e-book. You'll find the Best Sellers Rank information in the Product Details section of the listing right below the Product Description and Editorial Reviews.

The image above is a screenshot of Jim Harmer e-book, Improve Your Photography: How Budding Photographers Can Get Pro Results. It's the first e-book listed for the search term: improve your photography and it has a Best Seller Rank of 5,164.

A Best Seller Rank of 5,164 is excellent! Best Seller Rank is inversely proportional to the number of sales. So, the lower the Best Sellers Rank the higher the e-book sales. At this level Jim's probably selling 50 or 60 copies per DAY of just that one e-book. At $7.99 gross per e- book Jim's netting around $300 per day. Way to go Jim!

If you see an e-book without a Best Sellers Rank it means it's either been published within the past 48 hours or it hasn't had any sales yet.

If you look at the Best Sellers Rank for the first five of Jim Harmer's e-books (he also has a sixth one that he co-authored) you will see that they are ranked from 5,164 to 36,134. All are very respectable rankings. Altogether I'd estimate Jim is selling 120 – 150 e-books per day.

Now look at the other listings by the other authors. The best of the lot is ranked at 127,059 which equates to four, maybe five sales per month. The others are 387,000 – 686,000 which equates to one or two sale in the past six months.

This tells me this is a market to avoid!

So what would be a good market? Here's what I'm looking for in a market:

At least 37 total results (4 pages)

No more than 200 results (17 pages)

At least one big player on page 1

At least one smaller player on page 1

A lot of players doing poorly (on any page)

A position on page 1 I can take over

We'll look at an example in a minute but first I want to show you another tool Amazon is kind enough to provide us with:

Notice the results are automatically sorted by Relevancy. And if you click on the Sort by drop down box you'll see this:

There are five other sort options the person searching can use. But, since Relevancy is the default sort it is the most used. Probably > 95% of the time.

We're going to talk more about Relevancy in the section on Ranking. For now take a look at the second sort option: Popularity.

Take a guess what "Popularity" used to be called before Amazon changed it a few months ago:

"Sales Rank!"

To see the e-books with the most units sold just select Popularity from the Sort by drop down box when you do a search.

Also, note you can sort by price Low to High. We'll be looking at that in the Ranking Section as well.

Now that I've given you the background information I want to show you how to use this information together to find a market with the potential to be profitable.

Let's look at a market that has potential for profitability: Belly Fat

_N_ _ote:_ _I coul_ _d_ _n't_ _get_ _all_ _12_ _li_ _s_ _ting_ _in_ _o_ _ne_ _s_ _creen_ _s_ _hot_ _so_ _I la_ _i_ _d_ _it_ _out_ _in_ _t_ _w_ _o_ _column_ _s_ _._

Looks like Jorge Cruise is the top dog in the "Belly Fat" market. He has six e-books on the first page of the Kindle Store for the term "Belly Fat."

But, remember what I said above, "Results are sorted by relevancy NOT popularity." Sort by Popularity and this is what you'll see:

_N_ _ote:_ _I coul_ _d_ _n't_ _get_ _all_ _12_ _li_ _s_ _ting_ _in_ _o_ _ne_ _s_ _creen_ _s_ _hot_ _so_ _I la_ _i_ _d_ _it_ _out_ _in_ _t_ _w_ _o_ _column_ _s_ _._

Jorge Cruse still has one e-book on the first page but it's in the 12th position. We now see several other e-books listed at the top. And the results are on all different kinds of topics besides Belly Fat: Everything from Fat Burning to Gluten Free to Sexy Abs. Only a couple of the results are specifically about Belly Fat.

Here's the first one that appears on both pages (sorted by relevancy and popularity)

The 5-Second Flat Belly Secret - Lose 2-3 Inches from Your Belly in Less Than 1 Month by Jennifer Jolan

Jennifer's Best Sellers Rank is #1,327.

But that e-book appears to be targeting Flat Belly not Belly Fat. The term Belly Fat doesn't even appear in the title.

That tells me Belly Fat is probably not a good niche to target. Why? The most popular e-books that appear on the first page of results for that keyword phrase are only marginally about Belly Fat.

So let's keep poking around in the same general area and see if we can find something better. Take a close look at the title of Jennifer Jolan's e-book: The 5-Second Flat Belly Secret – Lose 2-3 Inches from Your Belly in Less Than 1 Month

Let's explore the term "Flat Belly."

_N_ _ote:_ _I coul_ _d_ _n't_ _get_ _all_ _12_ _li_ _s_ _ting_ _in_ _o_ _ne_ _s_ _creen_ _s_ _hot_ _so_ _I la_ _i_ _d_ _it_ _out_ _in_ _t_ _w_ _o_ _column_ _s_ _._

This is the first page of results for the term "flat belly" this time sorted by Popularity. Now, are these results mostly related to "flat belly?"

Of the 12 listings six have the exact phrase "flat belly" in the title and a seventh has the words "flat" and "belly" in the title.

Flat Belly looks like a much better term.

Now, let's look at the Best Sellers Rank for each:

Let's refer back to what I'm looking for in a market:

At least 37 total results (4 pages) -- this one has 39.

No more than 200 results (17 pages) -- 39 is still good.

At least one big player on page 1 -- any sales rank under 10,000 is excellent.

At least one smaller player on page 1 -- any sales rank under 20,000 is great.

A lot of players doing poorly (on any page) – over 100,000 ranking is poor.

A position on the first page I can take over. – I call this the goat.

Looking great so far. Lots of big and small players in the market who are all doing well. Plus a couple of goats I should be able to take over.

As a double-check I'll also run the results for the same keyword but this time sorted by relevance. What I'm looking for is how many titles are on the first page for Popularity and Relevancy. This is what I call the intersection of Popularity and Relevancy.

The ones that are common are indicated with a red border:

8 out of 12 are on both the Relevancy and Popularity pages. I usually shoot for 2 or 3 so I would say this is an excellent niche.

How do you find niches like this? Just look around like I did. Do some broad keyword searches. Look around in the categories and look for the top 100 best sellers for each category.

This link will take you to a page that has all the Kindle e-book categories on the left side:

http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-e-books/

Each category will have a sub-category and many times those will have multiple sub-sub- categories. Drill down and start exploring.

When you get down to the last level of sub-categories look at the first page of results. Use the same criteria as above to determine if it's worthwhile to try to enter the niche. Again, that criterion is:

No more than 200 results (17 pages)

At least 37 total results (4 pages)

At least one big player on page 1 -- any sales rank under 10,000 is excellent.

At least one smaller player on page 1 -- any sales rank under 20,000 is great.

A lot of players doing poorly (on any page) – over 100,000 ranking is poor.

A position on the first page I can take over. – The goat.

 http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Kindle-Store/zgbs/digital-text

Step 2:

Click on the Kindle e-books

Step 3:

Click on the Nonfiction

I know fiction books sell better but you need to be a novelist to write fiction. Non-fiction books work better for the majority of us at the moment.

Step 4:

Find Out What Most People Are Buying in the Top 100 Paid Books. You want to follow the successes of these Top Paid 100 Books that people are paying.

You are looking at these books because these books are selling very well in kindle. If nothing interests you in the first 20 pages, go to the next 20 pages. If nothing grabs you, continue moving to the next 20 pages until you find what INTERESTS YOU.

Note them down as you go through the list. This will only take you 5 to 10 minutes.

Step 5:

Now, Zero in on the first 2 books to Create Your Own Success:

1st Secret Tip:

I do my books in couplets. The purpose is to save time to get double results.

2nd Secret Tip:

Find books that are selling between $2.99 and $9.99

You want to get 70% Royalty for the time and effort you are putting into this.

Remember, you are creating your own success, so don't pick those books that are selling $.99. (I have books selling $1.17, but these work better for the 'borrowed' feature than for the 70% Royalty sales.)

This is so easy and fun!

Just find 2 books that grab your interest. Write them down here:

Book 1:

Book 2:

Step 6:

Do your books in COUPLETS

You are going to do your books in couplets so you are going to work on these 2 books together!

The 2 BOOKS that I chose are these 2:

Steve Jobs is #4 now.

But when I created this book back in November, it was #1.

Reason why I chose this book: It was Amazon Best Book of the Month in November. (This means this book is selling crazy)

This is what you can do – watch out for the Best Books of the Month. You notice the price there for Steve Jobs book is $14.99. That's because I live in Pakistan. If there is Amazon in your country, it should be $9.99.

The second book that I chose was: 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is #36.

Reason why I chose this book: This topic interests me and that's why I picked this one even though this book is not within the first 20 best sellers. This one is quite good and selling for $7.81.

Step 7:

Create your success with these 2 books with HIGH QUALITY CONTENT. How?

a. Click on Steve Jobs Book:

You come to this page:

Of course, when you see who the author is, you know you are not in competition. But We want to piggy back on this great author. Everyone knows who this author is, so I make sure in my book, I include a chapter to talk about this author.

b. Scroll down to Customers who bought this item also bought. At the right hand side, you see this is only Page 1 of 11 pages.

There are 11 pages of material for you to look at. Can you see that you are not working from a blank page? These are your Ideas for your Table of Contents.

I picked out 3 from this list: From Page 1:

From Page 3:

From Page 8:

So now I have 4 Content Ideas. I write them down:

1. Write a short summary/discussion/review on Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacron – you need to quote the big guy's name.

2. Golden Quotes of Steve Jobs – His Own Words & Wisdom

3. Steve Job's Legacy: The Life & Death Of Steve Jobs

4. The 7 Great Habits of Steve Jobs, a Highly Effective Person

If this is not enough material for your book, I go one step further.

I search for "Steve Jobs" books in Amazon Search Engine for Kindle Bookstore:

The list of books on the first page usually sell quite well so I want to see what others write about Steve Jobs.

So I grab 3 more content material from here:

5: Steve Jobs 3 Presentation Secrets

6: The Story of Steve Jobs and Apple in the Year of  _.

7: How Steve Jobs Led the Way of iLeadership for the New Generation

Step 8:

Put your Table of Contents Together with these 7 content materials.

Chapter 1: Review of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacron.

Chapter 2: Golden Quotes of Steve Jobs – His Own Words & Wisdom

Chapter 3: Steve Job's Legacy: The Life & Death Of Steve Jobs

Chapter 4: The 7 Great Habits of Steve Jobs, a Highly Effective Person

Chapter 5: Steve Jobs 3 Presentation Secrets

Chapter 6: The Story of Steve Jobs and Apple in the Year of  .

Chapter 7: How Steve Jobs Led the Way of iLeadership for the New Generation

7 Chapters is pretty good – not too long and not too short.

If you have about 7 pages for each chapter, you will have about 50 pages. You are not expert on these chapters so you either do some research and write your own books which I do normally, or you outsource this part, which I also do if I don't have enough information about the topic or when I'm busy with my university studies and projects. I leave you to make your own decision. In the next chapters, I'll show where to find excellent writer and how to select one for your e-book creation project.

People out there who buy these books just like to read about Steve Jobs from all angles. They don't care if they had bought the other books but they want to read and find out more about Steve Jobs. Be creative in your approach.

So QUALITY content is what you are going to give from your ANGLE and PERSPECTIVE. So you need to be professional about this. Don't put a bunch of PLR stuff together. For sure that will hurt your sales and hurt your Kindle Career.

And there you have it your 2nd Method of Market research and table of content for your e- book.

#  Don't Worry If You Can't Write

If you're a good writer, then this business is going to be a dream for you.

If you're not a good writer, then there are options that you can use to be highly successful, and that is in the form of outsourcing your e-books and hiring the services of ghostwriter.

A ghostwriter writes books, articles etc and give copyrights to another person in exchange to get paid.

Now you might be probably thinking whether it's legal and can I afford it?

The answer to both of your questions is YES. Having your e-book/series of e-books written by a ghostwriter is highly legal and ethical.

Conventionally, celebrities who are not very impressive writers hired ghostwriters to write autobiographies for them and this concept was not only used in the past but it used today as well. Ghostwriter also write book for other well-known and highly respected authors like Tom Clancy.

With the invention of internet, e-books and e-readers, ghostwriters have started writing e- books on almost any topic. Normally, when you'll be hiring a ghostwriter to write e - book/series of e-books for you, you'll pay them fee for writing e-book/series of e-books for you. When you get the completed version of the book from the ghostwriter, you'll own the copyright and you will be able to stamp your name or any other pen name on it because it's now your intellectual property. In the next chapter, I will show you what a good ghostwriter can do more for you.

# *-*-*

#  Ghostwriter Can Do More For You

You might be thinking what else a ghostwriter can do for. Well, a ghostwriter can research the topic for you on which you want to write your e-book as we did in the previous two Market Research chapters. They can convert their knowledge on a certain topic in the form of book for your readers. They can interview people for you.

An experienced and good ghostwriter can review your table of contents and propose a better and effective table of contents along with a strong and attention grabbing title for your e-book.

One of the best qualities of a ghostwriter is that she has got the ability to write the book in such a style and language that it'll resonate with your target audience. And the best of all, an experienced ghostwriter can write an e-book for you very quickly.

But it's important that you mention time for the completion of an e-book. For example, if you want your ghostwriter to write an e-book containing 20 or less pages (the font size must be 12pt and font style must be Times New Roman), then it should be completed in 10 days. And if the e-book contains 20 to 30 pages then it should be completed in 15 days and so on and so forth.

Ask your ghostwriter to provide you with 1 to 2 paragraph attention grabbing description for the e-book because you'll use it in the description when you'll be publishing your e-book on Amazon. And this description is very powerful sales page for your e-book. In the next chapter, I will show where to find excellent ghostwriters and what to write to get a great one in your ad.

#  Where You will Find Ghostwriters – Template Included

There are a lot of sties for outsourcing but the two famous websites with a lot of ghostwriters hanging out there. #1 Elance.com and #2 Guru.com. Both sites essentially operate in the same way. Basically, what you do is post your ad about what you want, in this case an e -book and after that you wait for the responses from ghostwriters then you choose a writer from the ones who responded and agree on schedule and the fee for the e -book. Once these things are set, the ghostwriter will write an e -book for you and after you get e-book, you'll pay them the fee.

Other Book Writing Services Include:

#  Give Your E-book a Killer Cover – Template Included

_"Wait! Why would an_ _e-_ _book n_ _ee_ _d co_ _ve_ _r art?"_

Once again this step is going to drive the more "practical" people out there crazy...The ones who believe a book should only be judged on its content, and not by its appearance.

But the fact is that a professional looking cover gives your e-book a professional image....giving your e-book the feel that it was written by a professional - and not someone on their sofa...or in their home office...or at a Starbucks.

The more "practical" people will say that a poor cover only speaks to the designer who created

it...or if the author created it, to the authors design skills...and not his writing or content.

The problem with that is that in the eyes of potential customers an amateurish cover just screams "amateur" about the entire e-book...not just the cover. Perception is reality...whether it's true or not. I absolutely love when I find a book or e-book that is selling well despite a lousy cover.

This tells me that I can publish a related product with a killer cover, and know with almost certainty that the book will sell. The problem for many people when it comes to this is that they don't have the skills needed to create their own cover. There are several ways around this.

##

## Hire a Designer

If you can't design your own covers, you can always try to hire someone else to do it for you. There are several freelancers offering this service, with more and more popping up as the demand for Kindle e-book covers increases. As with any type of service, the prices will vary...and the more talented designers are likely to cost you more money.

I've put together a list of designers, just search for them on Google. I know of that offer this service:

_St_ _r_ _ee_ _tLight Graphics Ronn_ _e_ _ll D._ _P_ _o_ _r_ _t_ _e_ _r_ _Designs Ex_ _te_ _nd_ _e_ _d I_ _m_ _age_ _r_ _y -_ _Ca_ _r_ _l_ _Gr_ _av_ _e_ _s BookCov_ _er_ _P_ _r_ _o_

_Delaney D_ _e_ _signs_

Boo _kCov_ _er_ _D_ _e_ _sign_ _e_ _r_ - _Kar_ _r_ _ie_ _R_ _oss_

Here's the thing about covers for Kindle e-books though...

There really is no layout involved, so the reality is that almost any graphic designer can create a cover for you. It's just a flat image...

Sometimes you can find some very talented designers willing to work for less money because they are looking to build up a portfolio or simply because they live in a part of the world where they can afford to charge less for their services.

While many American or European designers may not be willing to create a cover for you for less than $50 or $100, you may be able to find someone with similar skills who lives in another part of the world, like India, that allows them to charge less.

Your $20 or $25 may not be worth the effort for some designers to even respond to your email. However, for someone else in another country...it may be enough to feed their family.

One more little tip

When hiring a designer, make sure that if they use images in the design of your cover that the images are properly licensed. Most designers know this...but it is especially important if you are hiring a cheaper designer. Make sure they obtain the proper licenses, even if it costs you a couple of extra dollars to buy the rights to the image yourself.

It's much better to deal with that then to have to deal with someone's lawyer down the line when you come to find that your graphic designer just copied some images from Google Images.

Here is the Book Cover Template

===============

Hello,

I am looking for a cover for my Kindle book that is simple but professional and attention grabbing. The cover is one of the key factors determining whether my book will sell.

Just a few more information so you can start working on the cover:

Title: [please enter]

Subtitle: [please enter]

Author's name: [please enter]

In case you satisfy my expectations and deliver a high quality cover, I will leave a very positive review on your profile and order more covers the next week.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

===============

Important:

We don't recommend specifying the color or design. Let the designer come up with something! Furthermore, it is not necessary to attach an image. Assumed you found an image that the designer should use, you are free to attach it though.

#  Creating Your Own Attractive Covers

I completely understand that for some people the idea of hiring a designer to create a cover for them doesn't make sense financially. If all you can afford to invest is your own time and effort, then there are still ways you can create professional looking covers for your products. First things first...

If you are going to create your own covers, please follow this one golden rule:

**K** **e** **e** **p it SI** **M** **P** **LE!**

The biggest mistake someone can make when trying to create their own cover is to try and create something too complex. Professional designers get paid well because what they do takes creativity and a certain skill set.

It's very likely that you have neither. This doesn't mean that you can't create a killer cover though...you just have to go about it in a different way. You can create something that looks professional while also being simple.

Here is one example of a self-published e-book on Amazon that I feel does a great job of that.

As you can see, this cover is able to look professional while also being very simple and minimalistic. Take a stock photo of a switch, a white background, and some basic text...voila....

We get a professional cover. You don't even need expensive software like Photoshop to create a cover like this!

Check out this FREE online image editing option - Pixlr.com

It's not as powerful as Photoshop, but it will allow you to do just about everything you need. Here is another example of a self-published author doing it the right way...and understanding that sometimes the easiest way to create a professional cover is to be as simple as possible.

How to Create a Book Cover for Your Kindle E-book

His covers don't blow you away...but they have a professional look and feel to them. They aren't sloppy or cluttered.

And remember this... Stock images are your friends!

Sites like **iSto** **c** **k** **P** **ho** **t** **o, Fo** **t** **olia** , and **BigSto** **c** **k** **P** **ho** **t** **o** provide you with millions of professional photographs at your fingertips for a couple of dollars.

You can always go the FREE route with images from a site like **Stock.xchng**

Finding free option on Flickr is also an option

For me, I prefer to save myself the time and just purchase credits on the stock photo sites. That way when I need an image, I can just go get one...right now.

**Fotolia** and **BigStock** are the way to go if you are on a tight budget, while **iStockPhoto** will sometimes have some more creative images, but they are often a more expensive option.

If you do have Photoshop, then make sure you make use of the resources for sale at **GraphicRiver**

Take particular advantage of the different Photoshop styles offered. These will save you time and money while giving you the ability to create powerful text effects without hardly any work.

The **Photoshop Textures and Patterns** can also be a huge resource.

#  Ranking Your E-book on Amazon Kindle

If you've been following along with my recommendation in the Research part of this report you should have a great start at getting your e-books ranked high in the Kindle Store.

That's because the criteria I used in the Research section takes into account the competition. Here's a rule to live by: If you're not on the first page for your chosen Sub-Category and/or keyword phrase you're not going to make many sales.

This is because most people don't go beyond the first page of results when looking for an e- book. (or pretty much anything else)

There are only 12 positions on the first page (only 10 on some Kindle e-book readers) of results. You want to hit the first page as soon as you can then work your way up as far as you can.

Note: When I'm talking about first page rankings I'm talking about ranking on the first page for the Relevancy sort order. This is because most people use the default sort order when they search and that order is by Relevancy. See the section on Market Research for details.

Amazon doesn't tell us exactly how they rank their e-books. But, by doing some reverse engineering (basically by searching certain keywords and analyzing what shows up) I've been able to determine which fields are important for relevancy.

## The fields are:

Title

Category

Author

Description

Search Keywords

Title of the book is very important to amazon. The closer your book titles matches with the keyword or category you want to rank in, the higher the relevance.

Let's say, you are keyword or category is "Dog Training" and your book contain that keyword in the title then that is completely relevant.

Don't forget to place your main keyword phrase in the start of your book title. But it doesn't mean to repeat your main targeted keyword in the title, it won't help you rank, it is called spamming. Avoid it.

After the title is your 7 keywords option. They are very powerful. Add all of the 7 keywords and again don't repeat them. Use all sorts of keywords related to your category and type of book.

After that, another important thing is CATEGORY. You are allowed up to 2 categories. They are also very important. Use both of them for ranking in amazon search engines. Don't forget to keep them relevant. The closer you are to your book, the better.

Description is another very powerful SEO tool. Write a persuasive sales copy in here and also include different types of related keywords.

Finally, there is one more field that is searchable and that is the author field. If you are credible author and people like your books, then people can search for your name in amazon and your books will show in the search results. This is very powerful for ranking high in amazon search engine.

Ok, after you list your e-book wait a couple of days and check to see where it shows up in the rankings for your keyword term or sub-category.

I always keep a spreadsheet and check the position every day.

After two or three days you should see a sell or two. People usually get very excited when they get a couple sales after only a couple of days.

While encouraging, this is a false flag.

What's happening is your e-book is showing up on the first page for Latest Releases.

Here are the latest releases for the keyword "diets" from the past 30 days.

Not a lot of people click the New Releases link. Most people don't even see it. But a small percentage of savvy Kindle readers do.

And right after your e-book goes live, for a brief shining moment (well, maybe a brief shining day or two) your e-book will show up on the first page of the New Release results for whatever niche you're in... regardless of the competition in that niche! Just like with American Idol you'll get a chance to show your stuff onstage to the judges (i.e.: the buyers.) If they like what you've got you'll make a few sales and climb in the rankings (the relevancy and popularity rankings.) And if they don't like it that should be a big red flag that something is wrong with your e-book, the niche or how you have it listed.

I use the New Releases info as a barometer of how the e-book will do when it makes it to the first page of the regular Relevancy results (i.e.: the default results when you do search in the Kindle Store)

If my e-book makes a couple of sales by being a New Release I know it has a pretty good shot of doing well if it's on the first page of the default Relevancy results. If it doesn't have any sales after being on the first page for New Releases I usually don't work with it to increase its position in the search results.

If you've followed my advice so far your e-book should be in a pretty high position when it goes live. But, if it's not on the first page you need to pull out the big guns. Actually even if it is on the first page you should still pull out the big guns unless:

1) You're already in the top position for your keyword or category. Or

2) You're on the first page and not making sales. In this case, no use bothering.

Ok, so what are the big guns?

Your ability to run a free promotion for your e-book. What???? Why would I want to do that?

Because offering it for free will cause more people to download it which will increase the rankings!

Free promotions work through the KDP Select interface. I have included a bonus report with this package that explains the KDP Select program in detail. But for now all you need to know is if you enroll an e-book into the KDP Select program you can take advantage of 5 free promotional days over the next 90 days.

That means you can put your e-book on free promotion for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days. And you can schedule up to 5 separate free promotions for each e-book enrolled.

So, for example, you could schedule a one day free promotion this week, a two day next week, and two more days the next week. Or you could schedule a five consecutive pay promotion (not recommended, by the way)

Or you could run a promotion one day and monitor the results then do another day, monitor the results, then another day, etc., etc., etc.

I suggest you do the later.

Here's how to run a promotion:

First your e-book has got to be enrolled in KDP Select. I go over all the pros and cons in your free KDP Select bonus report but basically it's a no brainer. The pros far outweigh the cons.

Basically, unless you're also selling your e-books through another channel (such as Nook or on your own website) I would advise you to enroll all your e-books into KDP Select.

You can enroll your e-books by clicking the Enroll link for each e-book in your Bookshelf:

Once you've enrolled your e-book select it by ticking the checkbox to the right of the listing:

Then click the Actions drop down box:

Click the Manage promotions link.

Then click the "New" button to set up a promotion.

Name the promotion and your beginning and ending date. If you just want to do a 24 hour promotion (which is what I recommend) make the start and end date the same. It will start right after midnight on your chosen day and end right before midnight of the same day.

Monitor your results. Lather. Rinse. Repeat up to four more times.

Tips on Pricing Your E-book

1. In the pricing of the books, I usually use odd numbers.

2. I don't like to price them close to $9 because I want more people to buy.

3. I don't like to price them too low around $2.99 because I want to receive more return for my effort.

4. For a book with about 70 to 100 pages, I price them around $7 to $8. In this case, I priced it at $7.27

5. For a book with about 35 to 70 pages, I price them between $3 to $7 and in this particular case, $3.57.

Whether to test for 1 day or 2 days promotion, you need to test it out yourself. Go for one day first and see what happens. When you put your book on promotion, you get the number clicks as if they are units sold.

You don't get any royalty on these free promotion clicks, but you do get to go high up on the Top 100 Free. So try to get to #1 in your category.

You can check your status in this area:

If for some reason, your book does not reach to the first page of the Top 100 FREE, do one more day of promotion. I usually get to #1 with 1 day promotion but you need to monetize your own books. Doing keyword research might be too big a science for you and will bog you down if you don't know some SEO tricks, but with the KDP select free promotion that just got started with Amazon, just take advantage of this right now while it is free.

You are allowed to have 5 promotions in the slot of 3 months. But for now, keep doing the promotion until you see your book #1 in the Top 100 Free Section.

When the promotion is over, this is where the MAGIC happens & YOU GET ROYALTY SALES!

This is what I did to my Steve Jobs book combining with the Highly Effective People in early January, and then my sales of these 2 books shot up. I can only show you the second week of January. It's not exceptionally high as I have other books that went up higher but I want to show you that for a book that I started off in November, the number is quite good, and this will only get better.

That's it! If you follow these instructions you should be well on your well to Kindle Publishing Success!

#  Professional Kindle Promotion – The Beginning

Congratulations, you're a published author! Now what...? While it's possible to sell your book without doing any marketing, you can easily increase your sales with this 10 step marketing plan.

In this chapter and next one, you learn how to explode your Kindle sales using only free, little known tools that are provided primarily by Amazon. Each step builds on the others, so you should finish the previous step before continuing on to the next. The good news is that much of this can be outsourced, and within the guide I have indicated which ones you should definitely outsource.

This easy-to-follow plan provides system to promote your book using only free tools. Once this plan is in place, it acts as the foundation and requires only little maintenance. By setting up this system once for each pen or author name, you can focus on writing more books and let the system do the selling for you.

In addition, many of these tools can be used to promote any of the books you publish, not just your Kindle versions.

This chapter assumes you have some familiarity with publishing to the Kindle, and have published books that you are ready to promote.

This chapter and the next one provide step-by-step guidance with screenshots. You may want to have your internet browser open so you can follow along with each step. Let's get started promoting!

**S** **tep** **1:** **S** **etup** **an** **A** **m** **azon** **A** **uth** **o** **r** **C** **e** **n** **t** **r** **a** **l** **A** **cco** **u** **nt**

This is the first and most important step of your promotional efforts. Amazon's Author Central page will list all the books associated with your author or pen name. When people go to any of your book listings, they will see a link to your author page and be able to find out more about you. It's also a great place to see all of your book's ranking information and reviews in one place.

**Setting up y** **o** **ur p** **r** **of** **i** **le page**

Visit the Amazon Author Central Page: https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/home

1. You will be prompted to sign into your Amazon account.

2. Sign in with whatever account you use to publish your Kindle books.

**P** **e** **n Na** **m** **es**

Do you write under different pen names? You can manage up to three separate pen names from one Author Central account.

1. Click on the books tab at the top of the Author Central page

2. Click on the Add more books link which appears

**Pen N** **a** **m** **es**

1. Search for your book by title or author.

2. Click on the _This is my book_ button. Once your pen name is verified (usually instantly) you will have a second page for that pen name.

3. If you want more than 3 names, you will need to create a new account, using a new email address with Author Central.

4. DISCLAIMER: Amazon's terms of service only allow you to create only one Kindle Publishing Account; but, I have not discovered any rules for creating multiple Author Central accounts

**Author C** **e** **n** **tr** **al P** **r** **ofile Tab**

Now, we'll fill in the various areas with our author information. Most of this should be prepared ahead of time so you can simply cut and paste.

Biography

1. Fill out a basic biography and include an author photo if you have one.

2. Include your interest and expertise about your niche.

**Step 2: Set-up Your** **Exte** **r** **n** **a** **l Pro** **m** **ot** **i** **o** **n** **al Too** **l** **s**

Some of your promotional tools will need to be set-up outside of Amazon, and then linked to Amazon and to your other promotional efforts. The good news is, once you set these up, they will work for you indefinitely.

Blog

Amazon displays your blog posts via an rss feed, so you will need to setup a blog on a free blogging service such as Blogspot, or on your own domain (recommended).

Link your RSS feed to your Author Central page.

More information can be found here on locating your RSS Feed:

 https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200649550#needBlog

Start out with 5 articles or blog posts about your book or related niche topics.

Up-date your blog periodically and your RSS feed will also update.

**T** **witt** **e** **r**

Setup a Twitter Account http://Twitter.com

Outsourcing option: Have a Twitter account created with a custom background. Twitter post ideas:

Tips related to your niche

Chapters Titles of your Book

Links to any other social media promotions

Feed your blog posts to Twitter

Link your Twitter account to your Author Central page

**Twie** **n** **ds**

Link your Twitter account to Twiends: http://twiends.com/

Twiends is a free-to-join website that provides a number of Twitter promotional tools. They provide introductions to other interested users through the use of 'seeds.' This is a great way to start building interest in your book through your Twitter account. There are some paid options, but they are not necessary.

Videos

Author Central allows you to upload videos. Videos are uploaded directly from your computer. Make sure to review Amazon's author video guidelines:

 https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?topicID=200649570#guidelines

The best videos to create are book trailers. Similar to a movie trailer, a book trailer provides exciting highlights about your book.

Here is a good step-by-step guide on how to create a book trailer with free tools:

 http://kingdomelectlady.hubpages.com/hub/Create-Your-Own-Book-Trailer-Free

Once you have a video, upload to YouTube, other video sites, and your blog for additional exposure. You could also create a dedicated YouTube channel and add additional videos.

It's always a good idea to bookmark and share any pieces of content you publish, include videos.

Outsourcing option: have someone create a book trailer for you. Fiverr has a number of providers.

You now have a fully configured Amazon Author Central Page. This will serve as your main base of operations.

**Step 3: Configure** **Y** **our** **A** **m** **azon** **C** **us** **t** **o** **m** **er** **P** **age**

Now you want to create your customer profile page. This is different than your Amazon Author profile. Amazon gives every customer a page to display their contributions, wish lists, and favorite items. We're going to leverage this option by using our profile page to create contributions that help promote our books.

Go here and sign into your Amazon account:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/

You want to use an Amazon account that can be associated with your author or your pen name.

Click on the Edit profile button in the top right corner. Here you will see all of the options for your customer profile page.

**P** **e** **r** **son** **a** **l** **i** **ze your pa** **g** **e by** **u** **p** **lo** **a** **d** **i** **ng your au** **t** **hor phot** **o** **.**

Fill out the sections underneath the photo, including the email and website associated with your book. Shape your profile to match your author profile.

**Creating Our Cus** **t** **o** **m** **er P** **r** **o** **f** **ile P** **e** **n Na** **m** **e**

Now we want to match our name to our author name.

Click on the 'edit name' link underneath the photo.

You will now have the option to edit your pen name, signature and where you live.

Pen Name-Make your pen name is the same name as your author/author pen name.

Edit your personalized signature: in this box create a tag or signature-this will be a promo for your book and will appear every time you post something with your customer profile.

When people click on your name and signature, it will take them to your customer profile page, which equals free promotion for you. This is a fantastic way to get more interested readers seeing what your book has to offer.

**Here are s** **om** **e exa** **m** **pl** **e** **s:**

Andy Sernovitz"Author, Word of Mouth Marketing: How Smart Companies Get People Talking"

John Jantsch "Duct Tape Marketing"

Kim Skildum-Reid"Author, speaker, consultant"

For your signature, put something like author of (latest book), or you can brand yourself with a tag or a slogan.

Now that your Amazon customer profile is setup to match your author profile, your

Amazon activity will help promote your book.

**Step 4: KDP Voice** **o** **f the** **A** **uthor** **F** **o** **rum**

Now that you have all of your book information in place, it's time to head over to the KDP forums and let others help you promote your book.

Login to your KDP account at  https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/dashboard

Click on the 'Community" Link at the top of the page.

Next, you'll see a list of forums related to KDP, there is a lot of valuable information, so spend some time browsing the forums.

For our purposes, head to the Voice of the Author Forum.

You can register for the forums with your author account. This forum is a treasure-trove of promotional help. You'll see many threads here where you post your book for others to: tag, like, and review.

Take a look at the current threads, and insert your book link where appropriate for others to tag and like. Include your suggested tags from the previous step.

On the next screenshot, I've circled three threads here I found on the first page that allow you to promote your book.

Make sure to review the books of others.

Visit the forum weekly to stay up-to-date with new threads.

#  Professional Kindle Promotion - The End

I have divided the Professional Kindle Promotion chapter into 2 sub-chapter to make it easier for you to better understand all the concepts and strategies of professional kindle promotion, so with any further delay, let's started where we left in the last chapter.

**S** **tep** **5:** **C** **re** **ate** **A** **So** **Yo** **u** **'d** **L** **i** **k** **e** **T** **o...** **Gu** **ide**

A _So Y_ _ou_ _'d Like to..._ Guide is similar to a Listmania list, in that it is customer- generated content. You will often see these guides on a book's detail page near the bottom. Here is an example:

You will often find the _So Yo_ _u_ _'d Li_ _k_ _e to..._ Guides underneath the Listmanias on a book's detail page. Guides are basically mini-essays that answer a question. For example:

Stop feeling guilty over eating meat!

Make better Paleo meals

Requirements:

Guides need to be at least 100 words and cannot exceed 5000 words.

Like Listmanias, you can include product links.

Your guide can be basic or in-depth.

Examples

For an example, check out this guide:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R1QLWDIGWY38JL/ref=cm_srch_res_rpsy_alt_3

This example includes a short introduction, and lists 5 books, with a sentence or two explaining each book. It's basically a glorified Listmania.

Here is another approach:

Lose Weight Really Fast: Paleo Diet / Slow Carb Diet

 http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R2EP430ZO52KVA/ref=cmsrch_res_rpsy_alt_4

The author includes how they lost weight, recipes, books, and accessories.

The author includes how they lost weight, recipes, books, and accessories.

Create Your Own

Your guide should be content of value. You may want to include an excerpt of your book as the main guide content, and also include your book as one of the product links.

To write your own Guide:

Navigate to the your Customer profile page

Click 'Edit Your Profile,' and Contributions

Select the Guides tab and click on 'Create your first one now.' You will then see this screen where you fill out your list:

So You'd Like To...Screen

Follow the directions to format your guide. Tips:

Write a compelling title. You guide should solve a problem and engage interest. The more compelling your title, the more traffic to your guide.

Your Author Signature should be placed in the "Enter Your Qualifications" Field

Write a guide for each book that you publish.

As always, it's a good idea to bookmark, link to, and promote your guide for added visibility.

**Step 6: Reg** **i** **ster** **at** **P** **opu** **l** **ar** **B** **o** **ok** **R** **evi** **e** **w** **Sites**

There is a number of thriving book communities online. Many of them give you the chance to promote yourself an author. Here are three I recommend that you join.

Shelfari.com

http://Shelfari.com -Shelfari is an online book library and social networking site for book lovers. It allows users to see what others are reading, and to share their own reading lists and discussions. It is sponsored by Amazon, and actually integrates with Amazon. As an author, this is another free tool Amazon is providing to help promote your book.

When the book extras information is filled out, per Amazon, it will be visible:

_On the Kindle de_ _v_ _i_ _ce_ _, while rea_ _d_ _ing, a li_ _n_ _k to Book E_ _x_ _tras ap_ _p_ _ears b_ _e_ _l_ _ow C_ _u_ _stom_ _er_ _Review_ _s_ _._

_On Kindle for iP_ _h_ _one and Kindle for iPa_ _d_ _, wh_ _i_ _le r_ _e_ _adi_ _n_ _g, to_ _u_ _ch the b_ _o_ _ok icon at the bott_ _o_ _m of the s_ _c_ _re_ _e_ _n and s_ _e_ _le_ _c_ _t B_ _o_ _ok E_ _x_ _tra_ _s_ _._

To setup your author account on Shelfari:

Login to your Author Central Account at Amazon.

Under the _books_ tab, click on the published book you want to promote.

Click on the _book extras_ tab, which is the last one

  * At the top of the page, you'll then see a link to visit Shelfari where you can edit and add information about your book.

  * When you click on the _Learn More_ link-it discusses how Shelfari integrates with Amazon.

  *  https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/help?ie=UTF8&pn=irid25724630&topi cID=200651270

  * Click on the _Vis_ _i_ _t_ _S_ _he_ _l_ _far_ _i_ _.c_ _o_ _m_ link and sign in with your author account.

  * Because you are signing in with your Author Central Account, you are identified as the book's author automatically.

  * Once you've filled out your author profile on Shelfari, go back to your Amazon author account and select the book extra's tab, and click on the _visit Shelfar_ _i_ _._ _c_ _om_ link at the top again.

  * That will take you directly to the book extras tab on Shelfari where you can fill out information about your book.

  * As the Author, it's a good idea to create the initial information for your book's profile, as anyone can make changes to your profile (although content can be flagged as inappropriate).

  * There is also a box you can check on the book profile page that will let you know when any other page changes are made.

Shelfari also offers groups and other interactive tools for authors to explore.

**G** **ood** **re** **ads**

http://GoodReads.com - Goodreads is the largest social networking site for book readers. Similar to Shelfari, users on Goodreads keep a virtual bookshelf, recommend books, and participate in book clubs and discussions. Good reads provides yet another easy opportunity to promote your book.

Register for an account, using your author, or pen name. Once you've signed up, do a search for your book. When you find your book, click on the author's name, and you will receive a request to join as an Author.

You request may take a day or so for approval. Although you should receive an email, if you don't, you can try logging back into your account in a few days. If your request has been approved, you'll see the ability to edit your author's profile on your general profile page.

Fill out your profile with any related user and author information.

Once you fill out your author's profile, you are ready to interact on Goodreads as an author. Click on the author's dashboard link at the bottom of your author's profile. There are many tools that Goodreads offers to promote your book. Start by reading the author tutorial on your author's dashboard to get an overview.

**T** **he Bo** **o** **k Ma** **r** **ke** **t** **ing N** **e** **two** **r** **k**

http://the-bookmarketingnetwork.com/ -This site is for authors only. You will need to be manually approved when you sign up, which takes a few days. Once approved, you will have the opportunity to fill out your author profile.

This is primarily a forum-based website, and you'll find plenty of tips and ideas in the different forums that are being offered. There are also several opportunities to promote your book. This site is somewhat unorganized, but it can be worthwhile.

**Step 7: Submit Yo** **u** **r B** **o** **ok** **to** **A** **m** **azon** **'** **s Top** **R** **e** **v** **i** **e** **we** **r** **s**

Amazon also has a build-in way to get your book reviewed by real people. It's Amazon's Top

Reviews list. You can find it here:
http://www.amazon.com/review/top-reviewers

Although top reviewers receive no payment, they do receive special badges that appear next to their pen names. They are ranked according to how many reviews they write and how many people find their reviews helpful. Many reviewers enjoy writing reviews and are trying to review their rankings. This is a great place to locate people who will review your book at no - cost.

**F** **inding Review** **ers**

I would suggest not starting with the top reviewers as they get many review requests. There are nearly 1000 pages of active reviewers (10,000 reviewers!), and you will receive a better response from reviewers who are still building up their ranking points. Start near the middle or the end of the list.

This task in particular is a good one to have outsourced.

Start by browsing the reviewers and selecting one. Click on their name, and you'll see an in-depth profile.

Here you'll find several important pieces of information:

What they prefer to read and review. Some of the reviewers only review physical products, although many review books.

Find all of the reviewers that review the same kind of books that you write.

Create a spreadsheet where you or your outsourcer can place the relevant profile urls.

Create additional fields for any related contact information, such as websites, email addresses, and profile pages.

Another way to find reviewers is to locate books in Amazon that are similar to yours.

Read the reviews, and look for good quality reviews that have a profile name with a _See_

_All My R_ _e_ _v_ _i_ _e_ _ws_ link next to it: Locating Reviewers

Click on the link and see the reviews. If they have a number of reviews in your book's subject area, then they are probably a good quality reviewer.

Click on their profile (in the above example, _roman_ _c_ _e r_ _e_ _ad_ _e_ _r 1326_ ), to see their contact information.

**Contacting Review** **er** **s**

Many reviewers will list their website and email to contact them for reviews in their customer profiles. Some reviewers many not have any contact info on their profiles. I would suggest weeding these people out. Although you might find their information somewhere online, they would include additional contact information in their reviewer's profile if they were interested in receiving contact.

Contact them directly though one or two of their listed contact methods. Having it all on the spreadsheet will make this job much easier.

Give them a bit of information about your book, and mention that you noticed them on the list of Amazon top reviewers and thought they might be interested in a free review copy since they have reviewed the subject of your book previously.

You can also go ahead and enclose a copy of your book (in pdf format). Don't forget to include your Amazon URL where they can leave a review.

You probably won't hear back from everyone, but if you contact 20 people, there is a high probability of getting 2-4 reviews. Also, once you have a list of reviewers, you can use it for additional books you write in that niche.

**Step 8: Enro** **l** **l in** **K** **D** **P** **Select**

KDP Select is a relatively new option offered by Amazon. You can find more info here: https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/KDPSelect

• By enrolling a book in KDP select, you make your book available free for Amazon Prime members for 90 days.

• However, you will get paid for any borrowed books out of the KDP book fund.

• The digital format of your book must stay exclusive to Amazon during the time period.

• You can enroll your book either after it's published or when publishing.

• It will auto-renew, but you can click on the KDP info button by your book and uncheck the box for auto enroll.

• Your book will remain exclusive to KDP during the complete 90 period that you enroll.

**K** **DP** **S** **e** **le** **c** **t Pro** **m** **o** **t** **ions**

The main reason to use KDP select however, is because you can run a free promotion. Amazon allows you to promote your book for free for 5 days out of every 90 when your book is enrolled in KDP Select. Here is a recommended promotional strategy:

• Initially publish your book for .99 in the Kindle store. Using the promotional tools discussed in this guide, your book will get some purchases and reviews.

• Once your book has 3-5 good reviews, enroll in KDP Select and promote your book for free for

1-2 days. You will receive a massive amount of downloads. This will increase your visibility and your book should receive even more good reviews.

• To utilize the promotional manager, click on the live title of your book in your KDP bookshelf. You'll see a promotions manager link for books that are enrolled in KDP.

• Click on the link and select the day you want to run the promotion. I recommend running a promotion for only one day. You will have options then to run the promotion again, at least 4 more times during the 90 days.

• After the promotion is over, raise the price on your book to at least 2.99 so you will receive the 70% royalty option.

KDP select is a powerful way to receive a large amount of visibility for your book.

The power is in the free promotional days, not necessarily in the option to have the book free for Prime members.

I hope these two professional kindle promotion chapters have given you a solid framework that you can use to promote your Kindle books. Once you have done these ten steps, there is very little you need to do to maintain your promotional efforts.

Every one-two weeks:

• Publish a new blog post. You can also drip-feed related articles to your blog over time.

• Promote your posts on Face-book/Twitter.

• Visit and interact on the recommended forums.

• Promote your videos on YouTube.

#  3 Top-Notch Strategies for Getting a lot of Amazon Reviews

In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of Amazon reviews. Reviews are absolutely crucial to the success of your Kindle book. They will add credibility and help you gain higher rankings on Amazon. Based on the reviews, people make their decision on whether they will become your customers or not!

The type of reviews you want to appear on your sales page should be marked "Amazon Verified Purchase" meaning that the customer who wrote the review purchased the item at amazon.com. In contrast to "unverified" reviews, "verified" reviews are much more trustworthy. Customers simply prefer reading Amazon Verified Purchase reviews from people who purchased your product already. It will simply add more credibility to your product than an "unverified" review. For this reason, our ultimate goal is to get as many positive "Amazon Verified Purchase" reviews as possible.

#

#

Let us share with you TOP FOUR strategies on how to get positive Amazon reviews. Instead of waiting for buyers to post a review, we will take action on this.

##

## Strategy 1: "Family & Friends"

Ask your family and friends to review your product! Most likely, they will post a positive review and you have full control about the kind of review they are posting. Just make sure the reviews look natural. This way it will be easily possible to get 2-5 reviews within 24 hours.

Since we are looking for "Amazon Verified Purchase" reviews only, ask your friends to buy your book and send them a gift card upfront or buy your own book and send it to your friends by clicking on "send as gift."

## Strategy 2: "Top 10,000"

Another strategy is to contact top reviewers on Amazon and ask them whether they can review your product. You won't believe it, but there are people who don't do anything else but reviewing products. Those people are definitely a great source to get honest and high quality reviews.

CLICK HERE to see a list of the top 10,000 Amazon reviewers. As you can see, it is very easy to get access to the top 10,000 reviewers on Amazon. Contact each of them by clicking on their profile. On the left-hand side you can see the email address of the reviewer you want to contact. Simply send them a review request and offer them your Kindle book for free. Send them your book as a gift once they agreed reviewing it.

This method it is a great way to get valuable and high quality reviews from people trusted in the community. You will not have to worry about negative reviews if you offer a high quality Kindle book packed with awesome information. In this case, there is no other option except getting positive reviews only. Quality is key to positive reviews!

Type in "Kindle review" into the search bar and join all groups having the purpose of reading and reviewing kindle products. Join those groups and ask authors and readers to your book.

You might want to take a look at the following groups:

## Conclusion

With a mixture of all 4 strategies you should be able to get to at least 8 reviews within a short period of time. Once you have obtained that amount of reviews, simply raise the price to $2,99. With at least 8 positive reviews you can be sure that people will start purchasing your book for $2,99 as well! At this point, it is time to go for the 70% royalty payment! However, bottom line is: the more positive reviews you get, the more sales you will eventually make.

#  Strategically Promote Your Book with KDP Select

This chapter is designed specifically to help you strategically promote your book to increase long-term sales as much as possible.

To enroll your book in KDP Select, you simply need to click the checkbox at the top of the submission page when you first submit your book through the Kindle Publishing Platform at http://kdp.amazon.com.

By enrolling the book, you are unable to sell a digital version of the book on any other platform, including PDF through your own website, for 90 days.

However, there are a couple of huge advantages it offers. First, it enables people to "borrow" your book as an Amazon Prime member. Prime members are allowed to borrow one book per month, and if they borrow your book, you are entitled to a portion of a pool of money that Amazon sets aside each month. This pool of money varies each month, and ranges from around $400,000 to $1 million.

The amount you earn is based on the number of times that your books are borrowed compared to the total number of borrows for all KDP Select enrolled books. You certainly won't get rich from it, but it's a nice addition to royalties.

**Note** : I just got an e-mail from Amazon saying that the amount of extra royalties for the month of February amounted to $2.01 for each "borrow." Each borrow can quickly add up!

Second, and more importantly, enrolling in KDP Select enables you to offer your book for free for up to 5 days over the 90 day period of your KDP Select enrollment.

You don't earn any royalties for the days that your book is offered for free...so, why do it?

It drastically drums up the overall interest in your book when you offer it for free, and increases the exposure of your brand to more people.

Most importantly, without fail, you'll see a boost in sales (and rank!) in the days following your free promotion. My experience shows so far that this effect seems to be everlasting. Sales seem to permanently increase anywhere from 5% to 20% per week after a single promotion...

...and you get 5 promotion days!

**This gives you a huge advantage over books that aren't** published with KDP Select - not to mention the fact it's only "natural" that Amazon would want to rank your book higher, as you're giving them exclusivity over your product.

So, let's talk about how to maximize the effect of your KDP Select Promotions...

## Using 24 Hours Promotion

As mentioned, enrollment in the KDP Select program enables you to offer your book for free for up to 5 days over the 90 day period of your KDP Select enrollment.

To maximize the effectiveness and visibility of your promotions, I suggest that you break up your 5 days of promotion into 5 separate 24 hour promotions, rather than running them concurrently and using up all of your free days at once.

In other words, when scheduling your promotions, you'll want the START and END date to be the same. That will equal one 24 hour promotion and will set your book's price to free for the period you choose.

I would separate each 24 hour promotion by a span of at least 1 to 2 weeks. This allows your book to "naturally" gain popularity, slowly and organically over a period of time, rather than having a large spike followed by a drizzle of sales in comparison.

Scheduling these promotions is easy. You simply need to log in to your KDP account, choose a book title of a book already published and enrolled in KDP, then choose "Promotions Manager."

Then click "New," add a campaign name (anything you want), choose your start date, the same date as the end date, and you're ready to go.

## Best Days of the Week

There are two days I've discovered that are the best for maximizing the power of your 5 free KDP promotion days. Although there are no "bad days" that you can really choose, we want to get the most bang out of our free days as we can.

As you'd probably expect, more people tend to use and download books with their Kindle during the weekend than during the weekdays.

With that in mind, the strategy I follow with most books is to offer a free promotion day on THURSDAY. Attention gets drummed up on Thursday, and then the "buzz" tends to leak over into the weekend to increase sales.

Another strong day to offer a free promotion is SATURDAY, particularly for the book niche. Many families have a large Sunday dinner, and the cooks of the family spend part of their Saturday gathering ingredients and figuring out what they want to have for their Sunday dinner.

As a result, offering your book for free on Saturday will typically get you a lot of purchases on Sunday and the following week, moving you up in the rankings and creating permanent increases in your sales flow.

#  KDP Promotion Enhancement Secrets for Huge Number of Downloads and Reviews

Once you have set up your KDP promotional period, either 1 -5 days, then you need to get behind it. Most people think that just setting up the KDP promo is all they need to do, but if you want a really successful promotion you need to give it a little help. That is what this chapter is all about, getting you the most leverage possible for your KDP promotional days.

## Kindle Directories

The 1st KDP Promotion Enhancement Secret is to submit your book to the following the list of Kindle directories at least 7 days (!) before your free promotion period starts. Those directories will promote your book for free on their website. This way we can achieve an even higher download rate, reviews and increase the visibility of your Kindle product!

## Facebook Secret

Facebook is definitely an awesome strategy to guarantee the exposure of your book. In order to promote your Kindle book on Facebook, simply create a new Facebook account. Make sure you come up with a trustworthy Facebook name.

Next, you will have to join all the groups, which are listed below.

Once you got approved, post the following message into each group on the first day of your free promotion period.

Listen up! My book (name of your book) is FREE for download from (insert date) to (insert date) on Kindle! Download NOW: (link). Don't forget to leave your precious review if you like the free book. Cheers, (your name).

This method is truly the BEST technique to promote your book on Kindle. People in the groups we listed love to read and discover new books, especially because they are for free. It will just take you a few minutes to post the very same message. However, you can expect several thousand downloads within a few days if you wrote your book in a popular niche. Your rankings will skyrocket and it is simply the best method to start selling your books.

#  Advanced Secrets For Expanding Your Profitability & Sales

Although everything you need to know has already been revealed. In this chapter, I will reveal advanced techniques for expanding your profitability and sales with as little effort as possible.

Many of the techniques revealed in this chapter will be of no use to you until you take action on the content in the previous chapters. Hopefully this is obvious to you - you need to have already gotten started in order to increase the profitability of your book/books!

So, if you haven't yet taken action on the content you've already learned, do it NOW before continuing with this chapter.

OK, if you're still reading, it should mean that you've published at least one book on the Kindle, hopefully more.

Don't be discouraged if your book doesn't rate well on the Kindle immediately, as it often takes time for it to move up the rankings.

However, occasionally you'll find that even with all of the proper "nudging" that you can possibly give it with your free KDP promotions; the book still won't make you any sales. If this seems to be the case after 45 to 60 days, it might be time to pull your book from the market and try to get it re-ranked.

## Re-Rank By Re-Publishing

Before you make the decision to "pull the plug" on your book, you'll want to do some analysis to see how it's ranking for your targeted keyword phrases. I suggest you do this ranking analysis process somewhat often, within the first two weeks of publishing your book, and then at least once per month after that.

If you find that your book is ranking decently for your targeted keyword phrase (result #10 to #20), I would suggest giving it more time before making the decision to pull the plug, especially if it has made a few sales.

Continue to run free KDP Select promotions to help bump it up in the rankings, and re-enroll it in KDP Select once the initial 90 day term expires so you can get the additional 5 free promotional days.

You should find that your book will continue to be bumped up over time if it's hovering around that ranking area, which should result in a substantial increase in sales once it breaks result #10 or better.

If your book is already ranking in the top 10 results for your chosen keyword phrase but doesn't seem to be receiving the amount of sales that you believe it should be, it is likely that the title of your book is optimized for rankings, but isn't enticing enough to get readers to click through to it.

It is also possible that the description of your book isn't strong enough to close the sale or is lacking an essential benefit or feature that the reader is looking to get.

To fix this, simply take a look at the other books that are available for sale in the same niche (particularly ones ranked better than yours, and that have a better sales ranking) and then analyze the descriptions to make sure that your book description hits the same benefits.

If you find that your book is ranking very poorly for your keyword phrase (past result #30), it's likely a result of the keywords and title of the book.

If the title of the book contains a problem, you're going to want to pull the book from the market, make some additions and edits to the contents of the book to make it different than the previous version, and then publish it with an improved title (shortened, possibly with double keyword usage), keywords, and description.

To help add "insurance" that your book's ranking improves, you may want to add a contributor's name to the book that is related to the keyword phrase you're targeting.

After you re-publish, your book will likely be placed differently in the rankings, hopefully with an improved standing. Don't be alarmed if there is no immediate improvement.

You will need to wait until you are able to use your free KDP Select promotions to help boost your ranking to determine how much of an improvement has been made.

Re-publishing is a powerful technique that you do not want to abuse. It allows you to correct for mistakes, but re- publishing all of your books could very well send up a red flag to Amazon and may have some negative repercussions on your KDP account.

## Build Physical Books

This is an easy step to take as soon as it's obvious that your books are popular, and it adds significant amounts of instant perceived value to your books as well. Many people are willing to pay a premium for a physical version of a book because it allows them to easily make notes in the margins

To create your own physical book, simply take the exact same content that you used for the Kindle version of your book and use CreateSpace to create a physical version of it. The rules of formatting are slightly different for CreateSpace compared to the Kindle marketplace, but shouldn't require too much (if any) alteration from the Kindle version of your book.

You should sell the CreateSpace version of your book for at least $15 (probably more), as the significant price difference between the physical version and the Kindle version will increase the demand for the Kindle version, as the perceived value will be increased.

The sales page for the book on the Kindle clearly displays both the physical book price and the Kindle price, and when they see a significant savings between the versions (the percentage of savings is calculated by Amazon automatically), it will increase the chance of a sale.

The important part about physical books is that they hold more "real value" than a digital Kindle e-book, which means that you can use them as prizes and rewards for people, and also as contests for people who comment the most on your blogs, leave great feedback on your books, recommend your books to friends, and so on.

The possibilities are endless. Physical books are low-cost, high-value rewards, especially if personally signed by you.

You can also use physical books to send to publishers down the road, if you ever wanted to try to get published by a major publisher and distributor.

Of course, this requires a significant amount of books sold (10,000s) and a powerful brand presence, which is possible, but requires a level of commitment that most people simply are unable or unwilling to give.

## Outsource Everything

I absolutely love outsourcing. I live it and breathe it. My virtual assistants do a lot of the grunt work for me that I simply don't have time to do on a daily basis. I give them instructions on what to do, and they do it.

Researching, compiling and writing books is not difficult. There is absolutely no reason you can't use a virtual assistant (I find all of my VAs via oDesk.com) to speed up the process wherever it makes sense for your business.

I recommend figuring out what part seems to slow you down the most and then use virtual assistants to accelerate that part of the process.

Whatever part slows you down the most, simply outsource it. You'll be able to produce books twice or three times faster with the help of just one person.

There are a lot of uses for virtual assistants beyond creating books and promoting the books and if you use them correctly, you'll find that they're actually invaluable assets...rather than an expense, as so many people view them.
