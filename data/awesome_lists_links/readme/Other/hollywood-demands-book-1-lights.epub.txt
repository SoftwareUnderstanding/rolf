To the workaholics, remember to never turn down an opportunity to fall in love.

Chapter One

Mya Basset stepped out of the town car with her curly hair pulled and gelled back into a side bun at the base of her neck. She felt more like an imposter than a legitimate member of the Hollywood film circuit.

She nervously readjusted the shoulder line of her long green off-shoulder lace dress, which exposed her smooth, brown shoulders. Its light fabric laid comfortably across her large breasts. Layers of fabric created ruffles at the end of her dress which hid her thick thighs and shapely calves.

It was a last-minute, expensive purchase. The price tag stayed intact at the back of Mya's neck. The occasional scratch from the hard, cardboard paper reminded Mya that she would be able to return the $1200 dress the next day.

And her newly broken in, matching green heels added a couple of inches to her usual 5' 5" height.

Taking out her pocket mirror, she looked over her make up. Emerald eye shadow was brushed across Mya's almond shape eyes. The striking color perfectly complimented her dark caramel skin. A touch of blush rounded her high cheek bones, framing her cute flat nose in the middle. The tint of reddish brown, like the color of sand in the Outback, was painted on her thick lips.

Next, Mya checked her matching green purse for the hundredth time, making sure her customized business cards were still there. She had had them made a year ago. In anticipation of her promotion to publicist at Iris PR firm, she had made the cards prematurely to motivate her to push for her dream. Now, the first step of her dream was finally coming true. She was getting a chance to prove her ability to represent her PR company and exercise her contact skills.

For almost four years, she had worked as a PR assistant for Kyle Ross. Underappreciated and overused for minimal pay.

Mya remembered the first time she had walked into Kyle's office. She had been an excited graduate from University of Alabama. After having applied to hundreds of Public Relation firms, Iris PR on Hollywood Blvd had called her in for an interview. She had been so juiced as she crossed over Sidney Poiter's star to enter the black and grey office building.

Later, Mya had been full of nervous energy when she had sat down in front of Kyle. Not just because of the prospect of finally getting her foot into the door of Hollywood, but also because of her hot interviewer.

Kyle's suit had given his 6" well fitted form a slick, stylish look on his lean, muscular body. Mya had thought he was sexy in his light blue shirt. He had had the first two buttons open as if he was setting up to model for a photo shoot for Hugo Boss. Later, she would find out that he rarely wore ties except for special occasions.

Kyle's pale cheeks and chin were smooth. Kyle's blonde hair was cut short on the sides and back. An inch of it was gel back on top of his head.

Many women found his appearance attractive, until he opened his self-entitled cocky mouth.

He had looked at her resume before he flicked those confident brown eyes up to meet her anxious stare and said, "You look and sound very.... articulate for a... huh...country girl."

He had slowly recovered from his borderline racist statement.

Mya had learned how to smile through the cloaked language. He wasn't the first white boy to be surprised that people of color were intelligent. If he spoke to more of us, he might know that, she thought. He probably only dated white blond girls, anyway. Wait, why do you care? Stay focus.

He had interrupted her thoughts by saying, "You just graduated and have no experience in publicity, or know anything about Los Angeles?"

Mya hadn't been sure if he was making a statement or asking her a question.

"Not many last in this office for very long," he had added.

Mya had begun to feel uncomfortable under his long stare as it intimately swept down her body, taking pauses at her breasts and legs. She had unconsciously folded her arms across her chest and closed her legs tightly together. Mya had felt as if he knew exactly what she looked like without any clothes on.

"I think, however, you have exactly what we need here," he had suddenly smiled. "Welcome to the team."

After his announcement, he had stood and took both her hands in his, Mya had stood up, as well. Her head had had to pull back to look into his face. She had watched in horror as he brought her hands to his nose and lightly breathed in their scent.

With an exhale, he had said, "This is a start of a beautiful friendship."

Mya had laughed after a beat when she realized his old film reference.

"Funny," she had said as she tried to back out of his reach. Suddenly, she was a bit uncomfortable by his closeness. She was attracted to him but something about Kyle made her feel creepy.

"Yeah, you like that, huh?!?" He had smiled back. "Let me walk you to the elevator."

Kyle had opened the door to allow her to pass by him with as minimal amount of space as possible. Mya had had to walk awkwardly out the door so as not to graze her ass pass his crotch. As soon as she was passing through the door's threshold, Kyle quickly walked behind her. His crotch making swift contact with her round butt. Mya's back had stiffened from the unwanted grope.

Mya had tried to fight back the headache of what had transpired after those first couple of years working as Kyle's assistant. Lesson learned.

He has been working her like a dog ever since. In fact, the only reason why she was at this American Cancer Society's Gourmet Garden Party was because he hadn't wanted to go.

On Friday, Kyle had started out being difficult.

"What is this!?!" He waved his hand. Then, he had turned a confused and outraged glare at Mya. His silently annoyed manicurist worked hard to move around his hand movements as Kyle sat at his black leather couch.

She looked over at the grey, almost blue suit that hung on his open private bathroom door.

"It's your suit for Sunday night. Remember, you had it especially tailored..."she had explained.

"No, I specifically remember Toni fitting me for a plaid grey suit. This is blue."

Mya had stared dumbfoundedly at the light grey suit. How am I supposed to respond to that, asshole? It's pretty much grey.

"Angie, get in here!" Kyle had bellowed through the open office door.

Angie Guttuso had swayed in with a big smile above her big, push up bra. Her blond hair swept past her shoulders and curled just above her silicone tits. She had a pointy, thin nose and cold blue eyes.

Mya had stared her down while Angie slowly walked in her red high Manolos and tight, short red dress.

"You wanted me?" she had said as her thin lips formed a sweet smile.

"Yes, come here, beautiful."

She had easily obeyed. Kyle had turned her to the suit. His hands rested on her shoulders as his crotch had stood too closely to her ass. Mya had grinded her teeth as she watched his fingers lightly rub the top of her breast.

"What color would you say this suit is, darling?" He whispered close to her ear like an intimate lover would speak his loving endearments.

"Oh, aw, light blue?" She had answered.

Don't act dumb, Mya had thought. You know you could hear everything we say with that office door being open. If I was fucking the boss to keep my job, I would say stupid shit like that, too.

"You see, blue," he had smiled back at Mya, in triumph. "Go to Toni's an get my grey one, now."

"That's downtown and I still have to prepare the junket details for tomorrow's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit event."

"Then you better work through lunch," he had said while he walked back behind his glass desk.

"But..."

"You should be happy that I'm gracious enough to allow you to fix your mistake. If you're not willing to take this opportunity, maybe I should find someone else who is." He had said before giving her an icy smile.

The threat had laid in the air for a moment. Mya's heart pounded in her chest. Fear of losing her job that she had worked so hard at was vibrating in her ears.

Without waiting for a reply, Kyle had dismissed his manicurist along with a coldly, silent Mya. "Now, get out you two. I need Angie to stay and take some dictation for me. And Mya?"

Mya had turned from the door and looked him in his smug face. "Yes."

"Close the door behind you. We wouldn't want to be disturbed."

Mya had eyed Angie up and down. Angie had had a sly smile on her lips. One of her eyebrows was lifted in self-appointed superiority in being given special treatment.

Will you be needing a cheap motel 'Don't Disturb' sign, too? Mya had bit back the comment. And instead, she had flashed a fake smile before saying, "Sure thing."

Mya's ears picked up the slow, long sound of "riri" from the unzipping of Kyle's pants as she hurriedly walked out the door.

Chapter Two

Mya stood by a table covered with a white linen cloth. She had had to she walk through posted signs of Sony Pictures Studio over a half hour ago. They were the photo displays used to entertain the dinner guests at the party. With no clue on what to do next, she placed herself among the cluster of standing only round tables.

Others at nearby tables were mingling. The occasional laughter hinted to the groups' homogeneous. Alone and by herself, Mya felt excluded. An outsider. Did I really belong here?

She was starting to see why Kyle had decided not to come at the last minute. Yesterday afternoon, he had sat down at his desk. A fork was in his hand as he had pushed around the pecans in his salad. Without looking up, he said, "A garden party is so boring. I'm too busy to mess around with that crap."

He had shoved a loaded fork into his mouth, ending the conversation.

"It's for charity," Mya had reasoned. "Besides, the contacts you can make will give this company some good..."

Through his stuffed mouth, Kyle interrupted by saying, "I can't stand that Fran bitch. I don't need to have her bore me about her health."

"She survived cancer!" Mya said.

I forgot how much of an asshole he could be, she thought.

Kyle had shrugged, "Everybody's making cancer such a big deal. Yet, everyone keeps surviving it. She was sick, now she's better. When I had my appendix taken out, I didn't throw a big party and go around talking about it. Move on."

Mya had shaken her head at his bold and horrendous statements. "It's not like she's got a facelift, or boob job," she tried to explain. "She is a guest speaker who had a life-threatening..."

"You go, then," he had said between chews.

"What!?!" Mya hadn't known if he was joking.

"Yeah, represent me in this firm."

"I'm an assistant," Mya's doubt had spoken up.

"So, you say you want to be a publicist," Kyle had pointed out. "Well, get on your big girl panties and do it. I'm sure you can go through a boring party for a couple of hours."

Mya had gone into shock. For three years, she had been asking for a chance to show she was ready for a promotion. Her throat had gone dry. Her heart had pounded in her ears with nervous excitement. Could this be my chance?

"Just show your face around. Drop our firm name a few times. Oh, and don't fuck it up."

Mya swallowed hard as she continued to look around the manicured garden that was the background of the multiple stalls and casually dressed Hollywood hitters. She stiffened her spine against the nervous energy that had wrapped around her.

I can't mess this up. You can do this. Just have a few drinks. You can shake a few hands. Introduce yourself. Make connections.

She had given herself the same pep talk all evening. It was like a mantra she had spoken while she got dressed. And, again, in the car ride to this event.

A waiter walking by stopped and offered her an oyster from his tray.

"Care to try one, my sister?" he bent down to her.

Mya grabbed one and said, "Yes, they look good."

"Not as good as you do," he winked before walking away.

Mya softly laughed after him. She placed the oyster into her mouth. Tabasco sauce and green chilies slid down her throat in one motion. Salty spice pleased her taste buds as she swallowed the last of it down. Her hand dripped with the excess juices of the oyster's shell.

Mya looked around for a napkin or at least a trash can to discard the shell. Since neither were insight, she deduced that her only next step was either to put it onto the table and risk staining the beautiful white linen with the oyster shell's red juices, or dropping it to the floor. Both options made Mya feel that she would be acting too common and low class. not the impression she wanted to make on the peers of her profession. Torn, all Mya could do was hold her slimy trash in her hand.

"Looking for something?" a smiling voice asked from beside her.

Mya looked to her left side in surprise. She was eye level to an attractive Asian man with dimples and pearly whites. He wore a white, brown and green plaid color shirt that was tucked into his khaki pants. Large muscles formed his upper body while his waist and legs remained narrow but toned. He was the tantalizing Asian version of Dwight Johnson.

His smile widened at Mya's quiet surprise. Then he jokingly asked, "Do you speak English, mama?"

"Yo-you're Mike Chang!" Mya finally found her voice. "The action star from the film, Smackdown. I love you."

Before she could stop herself, Mya had wrapped her arms around his neck. Still conscious of her wet hands she was careful not to get the juice on his shirt.

Wait, she thought. Why am I gushing over him like a fangirl? Act professional. Realization kicked in and she remembered herself. Mya ended the hug as quickly as she had begun it.

"Wow," his eyebrows lifted in slight amazement when she slipped away from his rock hard body. "Well, I love you too. What's your name, sweet thing?"

He graciously handed her a paper napkin that had been wrapped around his plastic cup of beer.

Mya thankfully used it to wipe her hands before offering one for him to shake. Then, she said, "Mya Bassett, publicist with Iris PR."

Mya hoped she had said it as confidently as it had sounded in her head when she was practicing the line in the town car during her ride here.

"A publicist, huh? Tell me how would you make me look good in the public eye," he flirted.

"Well, first, I would stop having you posed in tank tops for film posters. It makes you look like you're a poster child for porn. Then, I'd place you in charity ads with lines to make you more appealing to the audience. Having one-liners make people think you don't know the language, or that the producers are trying to hide how badly you act. Either way, it disconnects a large demographic of Americans...," Mya stopped when she noticed Mike's smile had dropped.

I've mess this up, haven't I?

She quickly backpedaled by saying, "Sorry I didn't mean to..."

He interrupted her with a kind shake of his head, "Wow, I don't think I have heard that type of honesty in a very long time. What firm are you with again?"

Mya handed him a card from her small black purse. After a quick glance, he slipped it into his pants' pocket. The casual movement was equal to a flyer someone would hand out at a grocery store. One would smile as they received it and put it somewhere to throw it away later. Knowing that he was just being polite, Mya waited for the next words to be a brush off.

Instead, he said, "Come with me. I have some people you should meet."

An hour later, the sun was setting and Mya was buzzing from all the people Mike had introduced her to. She had met celebrities, directors, managers, producers, agents, CEOs of production companies and more. Mya couldn't believe how many numbers and contacts she had made. She even scheduled a lunch with an up-and-coming director named Paul Malcolm. She was smiling from ear-to-ear as her new career path had finally opened up. At last, she was getting on the right foot for everything she had ever wanted.

Mike and Mya walked towards the refreshment stand to get a drink. A phone buzzed near them. Mike stopped walking, took out his phone from his front jean pocket, and glanced down at it.

"Mya? Can you grab me a beer? I have to take this phone call," he said as he walked to a quiet corner.

She walked to the refreshment stand and stopped dead in her tracks. They're hunched over the stall was Hollywood heartthrob, Chris Foley. He stood with a brown belt holding up his blue jeans that curve nicely around his tight ass. His plain white collared shirt contrasted beautifully with his dark tan skin. His normally close shaven blond hair had grown out about a few inches and his strong jaw was covered by a close stubble.

She had remembered hearing that Foley had been linked to rumors of breaking up a famous celebrity couple because of a secretive hook up at a Playboy party. He had dated models and actresses. The perpetual playboy. Chris always had a new girl on his arm. The press followed his sexual involvements at strip club and bar hopping events. Also, most recently he had been caught leaving a seedy motel. It was rumor that he was fleeing the scene of a raunchy orgy that had happened the night before.

Chris was raw and sleazy but his looks and bad boy behavior made him the top earner in action films and romance comedies. However, his drunken, and sometimes, uppity attitude was starting to make him difficult to work with. It caused production to slow and film offers to weaken. People were whispering that he was labelled as Hollywood poison.

Mya fought back her inner starstruck, fangirl response. It didn't help that he looked even better in person. Mya shook off the tingling feeling in her body and casually walked to order drinks next to him.

Chris straight into his full 6 foot 2 inch when Mya placed a hand on the stall table beside him. Her skin burned as she felt his crystal blue eyes run up and down her body. Mya's breasts warmed to his focused attention.

She cleared her throat. Then, she ordered a glass of water and a beer.

"Wha!?! an Australian accent shouted out as he ignored the pronouncation of the "T". Then, Chris waved a dismissive hand at the bartender. "Wha! Nar, nar, she means a shot of tequila. Give her a shot."

" No, really, I..."

"It's okay. It's on me," he smiled at her.

Distracted by his dazzling smile, she barely got out the words, "It's a free bar".

"Really!?!" he gave her a look of mocked surprise. Then added, "In that case, give the lady two shots."

He winked at her.

Mya looked down to check if her panties had dropped. His accent was one thing. But when he added a wink, Mya imagined phantom panties slinging at his hard chest throughout random times of the day.

"Hey, Foley, how are you?" Mike had returned from his phone call and was leaning over Mya to shake Chris's hand.

"Well, mate. And you?"

"Good. Have you met, Mya Bassett?"

"Yes. In fact, she was offerin' me a shot," he smiled down at her taken aback expression. Before she could deny his fictitious claim, Chris asked Mike, "Would yoou like to join us?"

"No, I can't. I have to run." Then, he turned to Mya. He placed a gentle hand on her arm. "Sorry, I have to go. It was really nice meeting you."

"You too. And thank you for introducing me around. That was really kind."

"No problem. I'll give you a call sometime," he kissed her cheek.

"Yeah, it will give me a chance to insult you again," she laughed.

"Looking forward to it," Mike flashed her his dimples and was off.

Mya was left alone with heart-throb Chris again. She looked over at his confident smirk.

Mya swallowed a giddy smile as Chris slid closer over to her and asked in a deep voice, "So, how about that shot?"

Chapter Three

"You're dangerous company, aren't you?" Mya flirted back.

"Me? I'm harmless," Chris came over closer. "There's nothin wrong with offerin a beaut like yoou a drink."

"A shot," she corrected him.

"Well, a mini drink. Anyway, who needs all that soda in a cocktail."

"Yes, it's just extra calories, isn't it?" Mya playfully said. It was a jab at LA's health crazed diets that most stars and residents pledged their lives to.

"Roigh," he smiled again. His smile was bright and wonderful as if you were the only one a part of his inner joke on the world. Mya felt special to be in his close circle. "Gorgeous and health conscious. I like that in a woman."

Mya stilled her wobbly knees at the mention of him calling her gorgeous. It rolled off his tongue in a slightly nasally sing-song voice. Chris's Australian accent curled around her ear which perked up in pleasure.

In the back of her mind, she couldn't help think this was another one of his smooth moves to get a groupie into bed. Mya's instincts told her to distance herself from him before she ended up on Access Hollywood walking after him from some hallway closet with disheveled hair and makeup.

That would be great, she thought. Classed as another one of Chris Foley's sluts.

"Well, what I hear, you bump into a lot of women that fit that description." she slyly hinted to his playboy reputation.

"Oh, I wouldn' worry about hearsay," he spoke softly. His eyes bright with merriment and sexual drive. Then, he lowered his voice. "Tonight, you're the only one I'm interested in."

Mya's heart raced. Her face and the back of her neck got hot. She tried to hold her ground. Mya couldn't allow herself to fall for his charm and devilish good looks.

She turned a playful smile towards him and said, "From most men, I would find that sweet, but most don't have every flavor of the week following."

"Ooooh, yoou would prefer one like Mike Chang," he blew out a ridiculous huff.

"What's wrong with him? He's sweet and you don't hear about his orgies," she cut into him in a protective need to defend her new friend.

"I don' know," his 6' 2" body leaned down to her face that was a good 6 inches down from his.

Chris's breath brushed her ear as he whispered, "Yet, if I was him, there would be nothin' so important that I would leave without yoou."

The way he had caress the word "yoou" made Maya's panties soak. Her heart bounced off her chest plate. Blood rushed around her body, sending her head spinning. She was two seconds from leading him to her town car when red manicure nails rushed around his chest and grabbed his pumped pecks.

Chris turned to wrap his arms around Top Model, Amanda Slater. Her long legs went up to her neck, barely covered by the light pink day dress she wore. A complete contrast to Mya's short legs and thick thighs. Amanda's rosy skin was radiated by the color of her pink dress. Her blond hair was pulled into a tight bun on top of her head.

"Chris, darling, how are you?" she asked during a long hug.

"Great, now that I got such a gorgeous beaut at this party."

I thought I was gorgeous, Mya thought with pursed lips.

"Yes, the fun has arrived," Amanda said. She was referring to herself. She began chatting on about a party in the hills that night.

Mya had obviously been forgotten. Chris absent-mindedly moved back nearly stepping on Mya's heel.

You're just going to step all over me, huh?!?! She thought. Like I'm not here.

Mya was surprised and her pride hurt from being discarded and forgotten so quickly. Even if it was over a Top Model. Annoyed by being ignored, she turned to leave. A ripping sound in her dress stopped Mya's flight.
Chapter Four

She looked behind her. There along the length of Mya's green dress was a hole revealing her thigh and the side of her ass cheek. Chris's foot stood on top of the last ruffle of her dress.

He quickly glanced over at Mya's exposed area while Amanda spoke excitedly about her weekend. Mya second guessed her decision to wear a thong. My ass is out for everyone to see, including this pig, she angrily thought.

To Mya's shock, Chris quickly turned back to Amanda. Then, he discreetly lifted his leg. Mya was now free from his foothold.

She remained there for a second, staring at his silent non-apology. Flashes of red throbbed in her head. Mya didn't know what was more humiliating: her torn dress or a film star brushing her off when a better woman came along.

Mya grabbed hold of the back of her torn skirt and rushed for the bathrooms. Behind her, she heard Chris raise his voice and laughter followed by a glass loudly smashing and the sound of splintered wood. She looked back to see that Chris had somehow crashed into the stall, breaking the wood table and glasses of the bar.

That drunken idiot, Mya inwardly cursed him. I hope he hurt himself good.

"Don' worry! I'm okay!" Mya heard him shout as she slammed the restroom door behind her.

Motherfuckin' bastard! she silently screamed as her head laid against the closed restroom door.

Mya felt humiliated, hurt, and angry. She had been starting to warm up to Chris. He was proving to be funny and charming. Then, in a blink of an eye, he casts her off like she was a used condom wrapper.

He destroyed my dress like it was no big deal! she thought. Oh, so what if my ass is hanging out for half of Hollywood to see.

Actually, Mya was angrier at herself than at Chris. Mya should know by now how to deal with douchebags and players of the film industry.

How could I almost fall for that jerk! You need to toughen up girl. This can't end up like last time.

Kyle had been rough with her in the beginning of their long ago love affair. At first, she hadn't wanted to rush into sleeping with him, but he never took "no" for an answer.

One night, he had driven her to his condo in the hills. He had told her he was taking her home but he had lied and taken her to his place.

Mya still remembered the stench of scotch on his breath as he had kissed her neck. She had pushed him away and said no.

"Oh, you want it rough, huh!?!" he had laughed. "You like that, don't you?"

Mya had turned to walk towards the door. She would get a taxi home. Kyle had grabbed her hand and forced her back towards him. Mya had pulled back again when Kyle's slap across her face echoed through his front hallway.

Mya had fell to the ground in shock and pain. Kyle had used that moment of temporary stupor to crash his body on top of Mya's. Before she had known what was going on, he had lifted up her skirt and had ripped off her panties.

Fear paralyzed Mya. She couldn't find her voice. All she felt was the raw, roughness of Kyle's dry dick ramming inside her, in painful jerks.

When he was about to cum, he pulled out of her and sprayed his semen all over her blouse. Some white drops flew into her curly hair. Then, he had collapsed on top of her, mumbling his love for her. Almost three years ago, Kyle had fooled Mya into thinking that he was in love with her.

She blocked out all the humiliating things he would make her do. He had so many twisted role-paying ideas and sex toys. One time he wanted me to pretend I was his slave wet nurse, she thought. The image of him pretending to be breastfed and having to change his diaper haunted her even now.

It took her a couple of years to realize that his force on her was just a sex power move. When he was done with her, she was stuck in a position where he kept holding a promise of a career over her head. She had tried to go to another agency to start again, but Kyle had blackballed her during an interview. He later threatened to blacklist her in Hollywood if she ever tried to leave the PR firm again. He claimed he would give her the shot she had been waiting for if she was patient. That promise was almost two years ago and it had finally come.

Now, she almost blew her shot for a movie star hottie. Never again!

Mya surveyed her torn dress. She had to fix this and get out of there, unnoticed. Mya yanked off the price tag. She wouldn't be able to return the dress now.

$1200 down the drain. Maya gritted her teeth at the annoyance of having to pay for a dress she couldn't afford. Plus, she would never be able to wear again. Mya wanted to cry knowing that she would barely be able to pay her rent. Plus, she'd be forced to eat tuna with rice that month.

Just perfect, she thought.

If he had only torn the ruffle part of the dress, she might have been able to tear the rest, leaving the dress with a high hemline. Unfortunately, part of the tear was across the side of her left butt cheek.

Uninterested in having her first day as an unofficial publicist be ruined by her ass spread across hundreds of entertainment magazines and newspapers, Mya looked into the mirror and thought up a plan. Her eyes narrowed in determination as the wheels in her mind turned.

With this dress you can't tell which is the back, whispered an inner spark of inspiration.

Mya ripped off the rest of the ruffles from her skirt. She easily slipped her arms out from the top of the off the shoulder outfit. Then she turned her dress around so that the back was in the front.

Mya checked herself out in the restroom mirror. The rough rip was now transformed into a nice slit that showed a bit of her chocolate thigh. Her long green dress with ruffles had transformed into a short green cocktail dress. Satisfied by her new outfit alterations, Mya nodded her approval to the restroom long mirror.

That should work. At least enough to get me to the town car and get the hell out of here.

Mya made her way around the white tents end tables of the events, unnoticed. She casually walked to the line of black cars and limousines. Luckily, she recognized her driver and waved him over.

After a quick exchange, the driver left to go pull up the car. Mya stood in the shadows, not completely confident that her wardrobe disaster was fixed.

She breathed out an easy breath as she stood alone and watched her car turn around towards her concealed position.

Suddenly, the hairs on her neck stood up when she heard the familiar Australian accent ask, "Leavin' without me, possum?"

Chapter Five

Mya turned. Her vision was greeted by Chris's solid chest. His white shirt had a wet spot that clung to one of his formed pecks. Mya's nose flared against the hint of tequila that was wafting from the damp spot. Her eyes shifted up to his sideways smile.

Don't fall for that, cute look, she told herself. Remember he is reckless and loose. It still stung at her pride that he had dogged her over a supermodel. Yeah, Amanda Slater is gorgeous and on a hundred magazine covers, but it's just plain rude to flirt with someone, and then ignore them for a hotter woman, asshole!

"I thought you had already left with...," Mya stopped as he leaned closer to her. Her heart leaped up to her throat.

"Nar, not after I met yoou," his voice was husky and his eyes felt as if they pierced into her.

Mya was afraid he could see how hot she was for him with his seemingly x-ray vision. She had to stop herself from crushing on him again. A need to squash his pride filled her.

Mya smiled icily and said, "Well, I'm sure that will pass with the next girl that walks by. I'll even hear about it on TMZ tomorrow."

Chris laughed. "Such wee of little faith. Yoou know yoou shouldn' believe everythin' yoou see on TV."

"Is that right?" Mya turned her head. Her car waited patiently on the street near them.

"In fact, let me take yoou out to dinner. Yoou can form your own opinion."

"As I am sure you will give a great performance, I do have to go," Mya started to step away when Chris grabbed her wrist and slammed her against his body. His arms were wrapped tightly around her waist.

Mya tried to resist at first by pulling back. Chris's arms wrapped around her tighter and pulled her deeper into the concealment of the dark trees and bushes. The shadows formed around their bodies.

Despite her instinct to flee, Mya's body warmed to the closeness of him. She automatically lifted her face towards his, surrendering to her deep attraction for him. Fully expecting his lips to crash down on hers, she slightly parted them in eager anticipation.

Chris's attention was focused on movements behind her. Shadows passed by his still face. Soon relief swept over his face.

"Sharon Garner from The Hollywood Taddle is gettin into her car now," he said in a warning voice. "You don' need that kind of press."

He had thought of me, she thought.

If the tabloids or paparazzi learned she was in a ripped dress with Hollywood's notorious playboy, no amount of talking about wardrobe malfunctions could save her from the 15-minutes of fame she'd get for being another one of Chris's sexual conquests. Her career would never get off the ground with that media stigma etched on her for life while Chris would remain being labelled as playboy of the decade. His career would only continuing to fail from his own self-destructive behavior.

Hiding Mya closely in the shadows wasn't a way of him to get a quickie in the garden. He was trying to protect her almost non-existent reputation. The selfless gesture began to force her to let her guard down even further. It made Mya wanted him even more.

The threat obviously had gone. He stared down at her open expression. Matched desire churned in his blue eyes.

Mya only had to stretch her calves up to taste his rosy lips. Chris could bend his head further down to slip his tongue inside her waiting mouth. He hesitated. A request for permission flickered in his eyes. It was enough to snap Mya back to reality.

What am I doing? she thought. I'm like a sex-crazed teenager.

She stepped back some, making him loosen his grip from around her waist.

Through the awkward silence, he asked her again, "Why don' we go somewhere more private?"

Mya gave him a look of scrutiny. I had a momentary lapse, I not going to ruin my career by sleeping with you, she thought.

Noticing her questionable look, Chris quickly added, "For dinner and a drink? I mean."

Mya began to shake her head no.

"One drink."

A thought popped in her head, Mya smiled sweetly up to him and said, "Ok. If you can tell me, what is my last name?"

Chris's jaw stilled. Mya could see him thinking of any plausible last name. One that might be close and wouldn't offend her.

If he says Williams or Johnson, I may smack him.

Mya watched his clueless expression change to one of assured confidence. Her breath caught. She feared what might happen if she did have a private dinner with him.

He spoke with genuine cluelessness, "Honestly, I have no idea."

Mya laughed in relief.

To further her point that he considered her another easy ass female, Mya gave him another chance. "Ok. What's my job?"

Still he shrugged that he had no idea.

Mya walked off to join her car. She waved Chris a farewell. He stared back at her in longing and regret of a missed opportunity.

"Nice meetin' yoou," she heard him call out as her car door closed.

Mya sat back in relief.

I missed a bullet there. Luckily.

She hated to think what might have happened if he had spoken her last name.

Unknowingly, a dark window rolled up on a closely parked black limousine. The occupant was a woman with her hair pulled back in a brown ponytail. Her bangs covered her forehead. A triangle shaped birth mark on the side of her right eyebrow was barely covered up by her long bangs.

She had witnessed the whole exchanged between Mya and Chris. Chris has another crush, she smiled smugly to herself while adjusting her red glasses. Then, she began to think of ways to use this new information to her advantage.
Chapter Six

The lunch Mya had scheduled with Paul Malcolm, a up and coming director, was pushed to a quick brunch at The Sycamore Kitchen on La Brea Ave. She hadn't seen it as a problem since Kyle rarely came in on Monday before 12. He was usually nursing his weekend party hangover.

The brunch proved to be invaluable. Paul sat in his silver metal chair across the wooden table from Mya. He had been so excited to get ideas on promoting a strong co-star to play the father in a new film he had written to direct. He had felt that his small reputation wouldn't get him the star power he wanted in casting. However, Mya had reassured him that he was in capable hands,

"Let me read the script and see what I can do to swing it to a few people that may interest you. We can try by getting a positive buzz around the script from the right people then go from there," she had told him.

In fact, the "right" people Mya was referring to were the networking base of Hollywood. Cooks, waiting staff, valets, and salon attendants were just a few of the soldiers she had been making relationships in her war to get to the top. These were the unknown faces that took care of the Hollywood elite. They kept all their secrets as bargaining chips to cash in on future favors.

And Mya had befriended them. She would level information from goodies and promises of upcoming favors. After years of work and finessing, she was going to test out the value of having these types of friends.

While running errands, Mya had dived into the new script. She was excited for her possible first client and was eager to get started. Her bubble was momentarily busted as she saw Angie sitting at her desk, reading through Mya's agenda.

Her arms were carrying a whole food Asian salad, an organic green tea smoothie from LA Press on South La Brea Avenue, the photo prints from downstairs, and mail packages. Kyle's new suit hung over her left shoulder.

She noticed Angie's almost cleared desk. Mya glanced over to her desk which contrast with an inbox full of letter correspondence and forms. Not mention the hundreds of emails she would have to sort through later.

Does that girl do any work? Mya rolled her eyes and thought.

Without offering any help to unload her weight of things, Angie said in a condescending voice, "You're finally here! What took you so long?"

Mya took a long silent period without answering her while she put down her things on her desk. Breathe, she thought. It's too early to snatch the bottle blond strands out her scalp.

"You really should use your time better," Angie lectured. "More things would get done around here if you prioritized your time better."

"And what work did you get done while I was gone?" Mya snapped, no longer able to play nice.

She had had it with Miss Slutty McFuck Everybody. She was almost out from under Kyle which meant she was close to getting away from Angie. Mya wasn't going to put up with her fake ass mess anymore. Then, Mya added. "What have you been doing besides working on your knees? I guess we have different priorities."

"What is that supposed to mean? " Angie grew defensive.

"Whatever," Mya said. She wasn't in the mood to play games with her act dumb routine. "What are you doing at my desk?" Mya asked with her hand on her hip, in annoyance.

"Looking at your schedule," Angie admitted.

"I know that. Why are you going through my things?"

"Well, since you are too big and important now to come to work on time," she stressed. "Someone has to pick up your slack."

"What are you talking about? It's Monday. He's not even here yet. And the phones are usually dead until then."

"Not today," Angie sang.

"What is that supposed to mean?"

"He was scheduled for a 11 am appointment this morning."

"What!?! I didn't arrange that!"

"I know. I did. And important client called last night and I took the call," Angie picked off an imaginary lint from her tight white pants suit with a plummeting neckline. "She was very persistent and demanded she meet with Kyle this morning."

"What were you doing here so late on a Sunday night?" Mya could only imagine.

"Working, of course."

"Hum huh." Mya pressed up her lips and folded her arms. "Working those knees again?"

"I..."

Mya cut her off before she could come up with some lame excuse. "Save it. I could care less how often you work Kyle. I'll be leaving soon anyway. Then you'll have to actually do some real work around here."

"Don't be jealous because he prefers me over you," Angie said. "Maybe, if you weren't so boring in bed, you would already have been promoted."

Bitch, Mya thought.

She pushed back the sting of knowing that Kyle talked about their past relationship with this ho as well as told her she was a terrible lay.

"Is that working for you?" Mya said after a short recovery. "Has he promoted you from dick sucking to ass fucking already?"

Mya heard a female clear her throat. She pause for a shocked moment. And then, she looked behind her.

A woman with her hair pulled back in a brown ponytail adjusted her red glasses as she frowned down at the floor. Her bangs covered her forehead but her hair only barely concealed a triangle shaped birth mark on the side of her right eyebrow. She quickly looked back up at Mya with a look of recognition which Mya could not match. She was certain she had never seen this small, mousy woman before.

In front of the small woman stood Susan Dunee, Hollywood's favorite romantic film star. She wore an embarrassed smile. Her long wavy blond hair was swept behind her ears. Susan wore a loose flowing flowery blouse above her pink slacks that stretched over her long thin legs. A tall woman. She nearly matched Kyle's height of 6 foot.

In interviews, Susan was always sweet and joyful. She stayed away from scandal and had a charity to help poverty-stricken kids to read at grade level.

Her publicist is a genius, Mya had always thought. But, there is no way that woman doesn't have something in her closet no one is that perfect. Mya secretly hated Susan Dunee and loved her at the same time.

Mya's fearful glaze looked up at Kyle's icy expression. Except for the vein that pulsed at the side of his neck, he remained completely still. Mya tried to swallow down the large foot in her mouth.

Kyle forced a smile to Susan and said, "Susan, it is always a pleasure to see you. I will get on that project right away. Angie please walk Susan and her assistant out."

"Certainly," Angie smiled smugly as she hurried around the desk and escorted the two away.

Once they were out of earshot, Kyle hissed between clenched teeth, "In my office now!"

Kyle walked to his small refrigerator. It was concealed in a long wooden file cabinet behind his desk. Then, he took out a Monster drink.

Mya stood near his desk, waiting anxiously for the firing squad to commence. She feared she was going to be fired before she could make it as a publicist.

"I cannot believe how unprofessional you have been this morning," he began. "You show up hours late for work and are yelling fucking filthy lies in front of star clients."

"I didn't know about the meeting," Mya tried to defend herself.

"So, that's okay then. Just show up when you want as long as there is no scheduled meeting," the same brown eyes that had turned her on in their first few months working together, now chilled her to the bone. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire your ass right fucking now!"

Mya's world shattered around her. She had worked too hard for the opportunities she had received in the past 48 hours. She wasn't going to give it up without a fight.

"You can't do that," she almost collapsed to the floor. Her knees felt like Jell-o. "I've never done anything but put my sweat and tears into this company. In fact, I wasn't late. Before getting your lunch and things, I was at a business brunch for a potential new client."

"You're taking clients now!" He barked. "You went to one party. Now you think you are fucking Ava DuVernay."

Mya ignored his reference to her idol who was one of the top Hollywood publicists. A very popular and powerful Black woman. Mya knew he was trying to have a dig at her dreams to be just like DuVernay.

"No, I...," Mya said.

"What, are you gunning for my job now, huh!?!"

Mya's heart fluttered in a panic. She had to get a hold of the situation before it got out of control. She said, "No, I just want an opportunity to..."

"Look, bitch, without my generosity you'd be some waitress at Mel's Diner, like all the other country bumpkin black girls who thought they could make it in this town. I made you and I can end any opportunity you think you have a shot at."

Mya fought back her tears. This is it. I'm done before I even got started.

"What you think this firm is running some kind of Affirmative Action here? Do you know I had to fight to convince Brad Slate to let me keep you here? He said why put your trust in some poor black girl from butt fuck Alabama. I stuck up for you. I put my neck out for a sweet piece of ass like you. And this is how you repay me by playing publicist and embarrassing me in front of Fucking Susan Dunee!!"

Mya couldn't push back the frog in her throat. She remained silent, afraid that she would cry if forced to speak. Part of her thought he would use this in his advantage by asking her back into his bed. Or worst, he might make her get on her knees right there to show her loyalty and appreciation. He was that much of a pig.

Mya knew both options were out of the question, which meant she was soon to be out of a job.

Kyle rubbed a thumb across the tips of his fingers as he eyed her up and down. After a long-exhausted breath, he leaned back in his chair and took a long sip of his Monster drink. Then he placed it on his table, and added, "You're lucky I'm such a nice guy because I've decided to give you another chance."

Kyle stood up and walked behind Mya. She expected him to unzip his pants at any minute. She braced herself for the rejection she was about to release. More than three years of playing bitch and taking demands were wasted.

Mya thought about what she would pack up to send back to Alabama. Maybe, I could sell some of my furniture.

Her shoulders stiffened as Kyle rubbed his hands over them. His crotch dangerously close to her plump buttocks.

"Here's what's gonna happen," he whispered close to her ear. "First, you are going to apologize to Susan for your crass behavior."

"Yes, I...."

"Shhhh, I'm not asking for your acceptance. You are going to do these things," he said as he turned Mya around. Her body grew stiff as she anticipated the pervert redemption he was cooking up for her to do.

Kyle bent down to her so that they were making eye contact while he continued, "Next, you are going to transfer all your responsibilities to Angie. In fact, get someone from a lower office to handle your workload. Some one less attractive. You know how jealous Angie can get."

Great, you kept me on to do the work because you weren't attracted to me. Why did you have sex with me then? Mya's self-esteem was plummeting even further. She lowered her head in defeat. First, you dump me. Then, you work me like a mule. Next, you told my bed fellow replacement that I'm a boring lay. Now, you tell me I'm ugly. This day just gets better and better.

Kyle lifted up her chin and said, "You, sweetheart, are going to put on your best business outfit that shows off that nice round ass of yours and reveals those big titties."

He wants me to dress up and role play- Oh hell no!!!

Mya cringed at the thought of Kyle's rough touch over her body. She remembered the physically painful way he entered her during the numerous times she had mistaken his forced sexual performances for acts of love.

Kyle eyed Mya for a long time in silence. His sugary, vitamin breath mixed with hers. Mya held her breath and looked away so not to confused him into believing she was offering him an invitation to kiss her.

"And get your fucking ass to Lou Garner's Santa Monica office. He's expecting you by 2," Kyle completed his demands and went back to his desk.

"I'm not sleeping with...,"

"I'm not surprised," he shot back. He raised his energy drink to his lips and finished it off in a long gulp. Then he added, "Luckily, that's not why you are going over there."

"Then why?" She eyed him suspiciously.

"You wanted an opportunity to be a publicist. Here it is. You have one client. It's a favor from one of our top client's Susan Dunee herself. She asked for you specifically so, don't fuck it up or you're fired."

Mya grinned from ear to ear. He's giving me a chance. Finally! If she wasn't so disgusted by him, she would have kissed him.

"Who's the client?"

Kyle gave a wide Chester cat smile and said, "Hollywood poison himself, Chris Foley."

Oh, fuck, no! She thought. Not that pig.

Chapter Seven

Chris Foley's head still pounded from the night before. He almost regretted going to the afterparty that Raphael DeLucci had thrown at this hot club on Sunset. He knew where all the great clubs were in town. Raph was a constant partier which was fine for Chris since they shared so much in common when it came to women, drink and having a good time.

Last night the liquor was flowing and the hot young ass was out on the prowl, but Chris was off his game. He sat and flirted in the VIP section. That was all. He didn't take anyone up on the roof for some sex stargazing. He even refused the double D twins that jumped into Raph's limo early this morning.

Chris had been with many different types of women, from the whore to the sweet girl around the way. All of them didn't get him interested as much as Mya had.

Even his ex-girlfriend Susan, that he had spent two years with, had never made him feel that excited before. Susan was a good friend and kind but there hadn't been a spark in their love affair for over a year before they had ended things. Besides, Chris always felt that he had only been an accessory to her stardom.

There wasn't any love lost between them. Chris had never been the relationship-love type. Yet, there was something about Mya that made him have to have her. It wasn't love but it was more than just an itch he had to scratch. Something made him want to possess her and make her melt in his arms while moaning in his bed.

Maybe it was because she wasn't impressed by his flirting or fame when they first met. Most girls jump all over him within the first few minutes of their greeting. Mya was different. She had actually treated him like he was a piece of shit that she would never be interested in. Chris wanted to prove her wrong and show her he could flip her his way.

Chris had spent all night trying to distract himself from her. The last thing he remembered before passing out was getting a lap dance from the Asian hottie, Trixie, at the Dames N' Games Strip Bar in Van Nuys. She still had white on her face from blow she had tried to get him to take in the bathroom earlier.

Chris wasn't a choir boy by any stretch of the imagination but he could never bring himself to do hardcore drugs. At parties and get togethers, he would dapple in weed and muscle relaxers. Sometimes you could persuade him to do E. However, that was where he drew the line.

As Trixie popped her butt up and down his lap, Chris's mind wandered for the hundredth time to Mya. The cute black chick he had held in the shadows of the garden party. How he wanted to bury his nose into her sweet coconut scented hair. His dick popped up a little as he re-pictured her ass when she had walked away from him that night.

When he had bumped into Mike Chang at the same strip club, Mike was coy in sharing too many details about Mya. Chris had got a last name. That was a start.

He would get his boy, Raph, on it. Raph was the master at hunting down fine ass tail.

I think he has an app on his phone for it, Chris laughed to himself.

As the sun came up, Chris sat back on his sofa in his seaside condo in Long Beach. Mya's bright smile flashed across his mind. He remembered the deep indentation the light fabric of her green dress had on top of her big, wide tits.

When he accidentally ripped her dress, he had noticed a dark caramel, shapely calf. He pictured it raised over his shoulder has he drove deep inside Mya. One of his hands moved down his stomach to wrap around his dick. He stroked it while whispering over and over again: "Mya Bassett".

A TV entertainment show had spun a picture of Chris Foley looking gorgeous in a close shaven haircut and crystal blue eyes. The show anchor's jovial voice over announced, "Rom Com film heartthrob, Chris Foley, has dazzled audience with his charming smile and boy next door looks for the past 5 years...."

He is cute, Mya thought as she stared at his chiseled chin. For a dog.

"... but his rise to stardom came in the form of the Flash film franchises of recent years," continued the reporter. " In fact, Flash 3: Race Against Time was released in early July with some mixed reviews. I wonder if that had to do with his recent split from America's Sweetheart, Susan Dunee..."

A photo of the tall blonde in big sun glasses and jean cut offs spun on to the screen. Her long wavy hair covered a good amount of her peach sleeveless blouse. The picture was in a parking lot. Paparazzi must have caught her on her way somewhere around town. She gave a sheepish smile and wave to the cameras while in mid strive.

How could a beautiful woman like her have been with such an asshole for so long? Mya wondered. It must've been low self-esteem.

Most girls were with jerks because they didn't think they were good enough to be happy in a healthy relationship. Mya knew too well about that self-decrepitation. Kyle had made sure of that.

Never fall for a pretty face who treats you like shit.

"...Chris Foley has been connected to various scandals around Hollywood," the announcer interrupted Mya's thoughts again. "The latest being the leaked sex tape of an orgy which happened last week at this motel room that Foley is exiting now."

The camera shot to Chris shamefully walking out the front door of the seedy looking motel. His dark blond hair was fared out in all types of directions. He wore a thick beard and a torn "The Vines" rock band t-shirt.

Even though, he looked like a homeless aging skater, Mya had to admit that Chris still was hot. Like the majority of people, Mya couldn't peel her eyes away from him. Whatever "IT" was he had it.

All that waste, Mya shook her head.

"Foley has been linked to rumors of breaking up famous celebrity couple,..."

"Well, well, here I thought I had to go huntin' yoou down. When, in fact, yoou found me," Chris interrupted the entertainment broadcast that Mya had occupied herself with as she waited for Chris to show up.

She glanced at her watch in annoyance. Then said, "I was hoping to fine you two hours ago, sitting at Lou's desk. But I guess, that was a stretch. What happened? You were supposed to be here at 2pm."

"I don' wear a watch," he showed her his bare wrist before crossing his large arms. His black Wilco t-shirt stretched around the base of the sleeve. A pair of worn jeans hung from is hips.

Unable to stop herself from taking in a quick glance of his arm candy, Mya forced her eyes up to his playful expression.

"If this is gonna work, you need to be on time," she told him flatly and squared her shoulders.

Crikey, she does get bent out of shape, Chris thought. No worries. She did come lookin' for me so she must wanna hit it. His eyes boldly travelled down her body.

Mya wore a long black skirt that hugged her hips. The short sleeve light green shirt had buttons open just over her breast. From his standing position, Chris could see a part of her round, wide tits. He couldn't wait to motor boat between those chocolate mounts.

I hope she brings that fire to the bedroom, he thought.

When Lou had called him to his office for a meeting, Chris had thought that it was another pitch for some action crappy film, or another romance comedy to get his teenage girl demographic to explode. He had not guessed Lou was setting him up with the girl of his current wet dreams.

Lou had thrown a few surprise stripper parties back in the day. It usually happened after he had received a bonus from one of Chris's blockbuster roles. But this was the best fuck surprise he had ever had.

Lou was due a bonus after this, Chris thought. But first, I need to make this bitch heel. Nar one tells me when to come and go. Not even your hot ass. After all, we just met.

"Look, possum," Chris walked over to her. "Yoou shouldn' be takin this so seriously. We don' know wha this could be yet."

She surprised him by saying "I do."

His eyebrow lifted as his mouth formed an "O" shape. Chris said, "I do like a sheila who knows wha she wants."

"Good," Mya said. "Well, let's get started. Follow me."

Chris watched her stroll into Lou's empty office. The small, windowless office had stacks of brown boxes and scripts scattered around the floor. Grey filing cabinets stood against the wall.

Walls were stained tan from the thick cigars Lou smoked inside there. There was a side door that led to Lou's toilet, where he spent most of his time jerking off to porn on his mobile phone.

Chris's penis started to get hard as he watched Mya's nice ass stop in the middle of the room, in front of the small brown desk. He imagined lifting up that tight long skirt. He had hope she was wearing a thong similar to the night he had accidentally ripped her dress.

Chris thought back to the nice chunk of her ass that he saw between the torn material. He wanted to smack her fat ass just to see it bounce.

Mya turned towards him and nodded to the brown chair in front of her. "Take a seat."

"Very businesslike," Chris said with a smile. He obediently came into the office and sat at the indicated chair. He was excited to see how her little sex game was going to play out. "I know we don' know each othah well, but I have a few ground rules."

"Such as?" She asked sternly and a little annoyed.

"I'm not one for bein' bossed around."

"Not good with authority, huh!?! A bit rebellious?" He nodded at her question in agreement. "Well, we have a lot of hard work to do and I'm going to need you to do as I say for this to work. Don't think for a second that I'm going to be tied down...."

"Hey, I don' mind bein' the one tied down. Just don' ordah me around, or slap my face. I hate that," he clarified. His dick grew harder at the idea of her tying him down.

Mya gave him a disgusted look. Does he always have to make perverted jokes? she thought. I guess I have to learn to baby another child.

She rolled her eyes. And with a heavy sigh, Mya added, "Ok. I'll be sure to control myself as long as you act reasonable."

"Deal."

"So, you use to date Susan Dunee?" she asked him.

Chris offered a nod.

"Is there anything I should know about that?" Mya asked. "Is there anything there that will bite me in the ass down the road because it is important that I know everything before I can proceed any further. I don't want any surprises."

She is so responsible, he thought as he shook his head. Susan is a clean girl and I'm always careful when having sex.

Then he had another thought. Or she might be jealous of Susan. How cute!

Mya's eyebrows lifted while her eyes pierced into him in a questionable way. Chris realized that she would need a verbal confirmation.

Chris lifted his head and sweetly addressed both doubts, "Possum, yoou have nothin' to worry about. I'm clean and safe. Also, forget about Susan. She's not a threat." He winked.

He is so sleazy, Mya thought. Just get through this meeting and maybe you can use phone and emails for any further contacts. Well, except for press junkets. But that will be fine since there will be others around to buffer his sexual behavior.

Mya turned to the desk as Chris stood up behind her. His cock hard and ready. She had laid out some papers to go over. Chris thought maybe they were some gag contracts. A way of legally silencing both of them from telling what happened here to the press. That was fine by Chris. He didn't expect her to be so stern and rigid about a quick roll in the hay.

Well, hopefully not too quickly, he thought to himself.

He wanted both of them to enjoy this. Chris wondered if he should push her on the desk so she would be flat on her face. Then he could pull down her thong while he rested on his knees behind her. From there, he could stick a wet tongue in her pussy.

Or, should he lay her on her back? Her legs resting on his shoulders as his face dug between her legs. He thought about how she would taste.

Maybe, she wanted to hop on his dick. Chris pictured her ass jiggling up and down on his dick. He hoped she could easily get wet. It made quick, hard fucks better.

"Okay, let's do this," she ordered.

A quick, hard fuck then, he thought.

Chris was happy to obey and walked over to her. He was a bit disappointed to be skipping the foreplay, but he figured they could do it during the second round of fucking.

Mya swiftly turned back towards him in a look of horror as she watched him unzip his jeans. He untucked his dick from its boxer brief confinement.

"Don' worry, possum. I'll be gentle," he had mistaken her fear as a reflection to the wide girth and long length of his dick.

"What the fuck!?! Put that thing away," she screeched as she backed up against the desk.

Alarmed at her distress, Chris tucked himself back into his jeans. "Wha's wrong?"

"What's wrong?," she asked back in bewilderment. Then she angrily added, "You just pulled out your penis in front of me."

"Aye, how else were we goin' to have sex?" He fired back in matched anger.

"We aren't!"

"Then, why the fuck have yoou tracked me down?" Chris asked.

"Oh, hey Chris," Lou said. A wrinkled black suit without a tie hung on his 6'6" lean body. His height made him have to duck under the doorway so, to pass into the office. Lou walked in with an iced mocha and a stained brown paper bag of a day-old pastry. The single light bulb of the office glared on top of his bald head. "I see you've met your new publicist, Mya Bassett."

Chris stared back from Lou to Mya in shocked and embarrassment before he said, "Oh, holy fuck!"
Chapter Eight

"Wha the hell is this crap?" Chris said underneath his breath.

He looked at the dirt field in disgrace, wearing a white T-shirt and red soccer shorts with white stripes running down its sides.

I know I've messed up a lot in the past couple months, he thought. And makin' a complete dick of myself in Lou's office with Mya was rock bottom, but I can' believe I'm doin this. I hate rugby.

Mya walked over to him after speaking to a few people from the press. She looked confident in her grey suit and black high heels. Occasionally, she'd stop to tug her leg up when her heels got stuck in the dirt.

Regardless of them being completely ruined, she walked as if she was gliding on air. Nothing could touch her. Chris admired her with pride. Despite how out of place she looked, it made her even more beautiful.

"Okay, you ready?" she asked when she stopped in front of him.

"Wha is the point of this?" he asked her a bit annoyed.

"Well, it's just a quick little press junket to show how human you can be without a bottle of tequila in your hands," she said. "God knows, we need a little bit of good press on you if we are going to touch up your image."

"Wha happened to: 'Bad news is bettah than no news at all"? Chris remarked.

"True, but I think you've hit your quota on bad news coverage this year. Let's try to sprinkle a little bit of good in, shall we?"

She threw a rugby ball into Chris's stomach. He bent over and held on to the ball with an expelled breath that had ripped out of his shocked body.

"Isn' this a bit racist?" he asked her when he could breath normally again. "I mean just cuz I'm Australian doesn' mean I play rugby, or even like it."

He turned the rugby ball around in his palms as if it was something disgusting to touch.

"Well, I figured an athletic body like yours can take a few hits on the field for an hour. Plus, it's all good fun, bloke." Chris smirked at the way she used "bloke".

"'Bloke' is English, not Australian," he cleared up.

"I mean, mate, or whatever," she recovered at his amused look.

"So, yoou think my body is athletic? Wha part exactly do yoou think has the most muscle?" he shamelessly flirted.

"I don't know but I could tell you which has the most fat," she said. "I'll give you a hint. It's four feet above your ass."

Unfazed by her diss, Chris added, "But a nice ass, yoouv to admit."

Mya swallowed back a smile at his cute remark, but not before Chris saw her lips purse into a slight grin. His heart swelled a bit for making her laugh, or at least almost smile. Chris got the feeling that he would like to do that more often.

"Alright, get out there," she said. "Don't forget to smile for the cameras and remember just have fun."

"Fun? Have yoou ever seen rugby before, or even know wha it is?" he asked. After she shook her head, he added, "It's 12 men in a hole, given an excuse to pummel each othah and get in cheap shots."

"Don't worry I told them not to touch your face," she smiled. "Get in there, pretty boy."

And with that, Mya gave him a playful slap on his ass as he ran off onto the field.

Chris entered the hole and was greeted with the meanest, ugliest men he'd ever seen in his life. A few had missing teeth. One or two already had a cut across their face and head.

"How yoou goin'?" he greeted the men in the huddle.

Most of them grunted and nodded a "hello" while others just ignored him.

"So, you're the famous Australian star, aye?" a burly fellow asked him from the left.

Chris turned his head towards him and nodded a yes. He placed his arms around the men's shoulders to his left and right.

"Well, we'll be sure to go easy on ya, princess," the man told him.

Chris had noticed that his tone suggested otherwise.

As soon as the whistle was blown, Chris felt pressure in his arms and shoulders sockets. Within seconds a big huge push knocked him onto his back. A foot stomped on his abdomen while another one stepped on the side of his head. Bells began to ring as Chris laid there in pain.

"Are you okay?" Mya's angelic face hovered over him in deep concern.

Chris was tempted to reach up and touch her cheek. Unfortunately, he could not move yet. When he finally did move, everything hurt and the marching band in his head had stopped stomping.

Mya grabbed his hand in a poor attempt to lift his heavy body up. A team member came by and was nice enough to help her lift Chris the rest of the way up to his feet.

"That was a good hit, mate," his team member gave Chris a hard pat on his back. It almost made Chris fall over again. "The trick is yoouv got to get your footin' so ya can push back in all this muck."

Chris's helpful team mate was a tall bear of a man with broad shoulders and a solid stomach. His thighs were bigger than Chris's head. He looked like a man sized Hulk, rippling in muscles.

"Are you sure you're alright, Chris?" Mya asked again. "We can stop this anytime."

"Oh, he'll be alroigh lass. Don' yoou worry your pretty head," he winked at her. "I'm Matt Cullen. Please to meet yoou."

"Mya Bassett," she said as she shook his outstretched hand.

Chris noticed his new friend was more concern with talking to Mya than actually helping him. It was made more obvious when Matt turned his back on him to get closer to her.

Soon, Chris heard him say, "It's just a friendly. I'm sure your man can handle it."

"He's not my man," Chris also noticed how quickly Mya cleared up that confusion.

As Chris limped back to the starting hold, he overheard his teammate asking to have drinks with Mya after the match.

Dickhead,he thought.

Chris hated another man closing in on Mya. He might have screwed up their what-could-have-been fling by showing his goodies too early. Lucky, Mya seemed to forget about it. They had slipped into a playful banter. He liked flirting with her and side stepping her smart comments. He wanted to spent more time with her cute behind. If anyone should be taking her out for drinks, Chris believed it should be with him.

I'll have to think about the best strategy to get into her pants, he thought. Roigh now, I still have a terrible game to play. Determined to somewhat survive at least one match of rugby, Chris straightened up his back. Let's do this.

Ten body slams and three dog piles later, Chris laid on the side of the field, exhausted from the worst beating he'd ever had in his life. The ground felt cool on his back. He felt like it was the perfect place to die.

The press had taken their fun verbal shots and photographs before being shooed off by Mya.

Foley's clumsy stunts strikes again, Chris thought. I'm so glad that I can provide so much ammo for the media to report. It keeps them busy. Not like there is anythin more important in the world to inform the public about. Mass murders in American schools, Russia readin our emails. Natural disasters devastatin' a country. Nar, let's talk about what Chris Foley has fucked up today.

Unable to move, Chris's pain was further agonized by having to listen to his meathead teammate pressure Mya into a date.

"Yoou take care of your friend here, Mya," Matt said. "And I'll be sure to pick ya up at seven tomorrow night. Take care gorgeous."

Great, Chris thought sarcastically. I'm glad someone enjoyed this day and even got a date out of it. Beautiful.

Then Matt turned to give a quick glance over to Chris. "Yoou take care, mate. Next time, we won' go so easy on yoou," he laughed.

Chris picked up his head and gave him a shallow laugh back. "Yeah, alroigh."

Matt walked back to the group of rugby players.

"I hate rugby," Chris muttered as his head lowered back to the cool ground.

Chapter Nine

"So, rugby is not your sport," Maya started as they waited around in the photo studio. Assistants buzzed around with props, light fixtures, and varies camera equipment.

"Nar, it would not be," Chris agreed.

It had been a few days since the horrific events of the sport that he had hated since childhood. Memories came back of his father shouting aggressively from the sidelines as Chris's 9-year-old body was being repeatedly slammed into the dry dirt and grass. Chris hated feeling the drop in his dad's ego every time he left the field.

Today, Chris's body was still a bit sore but manageable. Nothing a few beers and a half bottle of tequila could not soothe.

"I'm sorry I had assumed that...," Mya apologized.

"All Aussies play big outdoor sports," Chris completed her sentence. Then he sarcastically added, "Well, I guess that's more my fault. I forgot to brin my kangaroo to ride in on. And I left my big knife at home."

"You don't have to be snarky. I made a mistake." Mya hoped that would be one of her last mistakes. Everything about her career starting was riding on her success in turning this sex crazed, bad boy into a sellable product. "Well, now we know no rugby. Is there anything else on the list I should avoid?"

Chris stood near the snack table that was arranged with an assortment of cheese crackers, bottles of water, and a veggie platter. He popped a few carrots into his mouth. And after he swallowed, he said, "Yes, avoid takin' me to a place that doesn' have real food. Is this rabbit food?"

"It's just for snacking on," Mya explained in a lowered voice as she looked around at the people. "We're not here to eat."

"Well, if I'm not here to eat, they shouldn' put this crap rabbit food in front of me." Chris took a big stack of crackers and munched on them all at once. A few crumbs spat out when he added, "I'm starvin'."

Mya stepped back to his side to get out of his cracker spray line of fire. Then, she stood on her tippy toes and softly spoke into his ear, "Be a very good boy and we'll stop by somewhere to get you something to eat, okay?"

She patted the top of his head as if he was a small child.

Chris ducked out of her reach. "Wha do yoou mean be a good boy?" He popped a few pieces of cheese into his semi-full mouth.

"I mean be on your best behavior. This is a simple photo shoot. Do nothing else, but stand, smile, and do as the photographer says without question."

Chris lifted a flute of champagne to his lips. Mya snatched it from his grasp in mid drink.

"Hey!" he protested.

"That's been your fourth one," she pointed out in a low growl. "No more drinking. You have to stay focus and sharp."

A sexy redhead with a cluster of suits hanging over her shoulder sashayed passed them. Chris smiled at her swaying hips and her hiked up ass from wearing 10-inch heels.

I do like me some rangas, he thought as visions of her red hair flying in the air as she rode him popped into his head.

"Chris," Mya snapped her fingers in front of his eyes.

"Aye, aye, I got it," he looked over at her. "Best behavior."

Chris stole another glance at the redhead. Mya stepped in front of him. Her eyes widened and her mouth formed a determined silent "no".

Even in her angry stance, Chris found her almond eyes and cute high cheekbones attractive. Her flat nose flared a bit and the wide shape of her mouth made him want to taste her thick milk chocolate lips. The redhead was cute but Chris found himself more attracted to Mya.

"I don' know wha yoou think yoou are accomplishin by blockin my view of that girl," he smiled down at her in a sexy, sly grin. "If anythin', yoou just made my view bettah."

Mya tried not to blush at his flirty comment about how she was more attractive than the redhead.

"Alright. Down, boy," she mumbled.

"Yes, ma'am. Just be sure to tell me when you're ready for me to be at full attention," he winked before leaning into her.

Mya rolled her eyes. Despite herself, her neck got hot as she thought about Chris's penis salute in Lou's office earlier that week. He definitely had the right equipment to back up his cockiness.

"Do you have like an off button?" she asked.

"Not sure, but you're welcome to try to find it," he laughed near her ear.

Mya's eyes widened in alarm as she stared behind Chris. Chris looked over at what she was staring at. A tall, lean blonde in a smooth black business suit with a pearl colored tie strolled over in their direction.

He looked like a dickhead, Chris thought. With his smug smile and overconfident walk.

"That's my boss," Mya whispered. "Remember, best behavior."

Then she loudly greeted her boss by saying, "Hello, Kyle. What a pleasant surprise? What are you doing here?"

Kyle reached down and gave Mya a quick kiss on her cheek. Chris noticed that Mya had awkwardly shied away from the kiss as if it was unwanted.

"Hello, sweetie," he stood back and looked around. "I was just checking to see how everything was going."

"Fine," Mya said. "This is Chris Foley."

Chris offered his hand that Kyle ignored. "Yeah, the astronomer from that star movie, right?"

"Somethi'n like that," Chris responded through gritted teeth. His irritation growing. Yep, he's a cunt alroigh.

While Mya rattled on about the details of the shoot, Kyle's sneaky peeks at her body showed that he clearly wasn't listening. She would point and turn in a direction behind her. And he would be staring at her ass encased in a green skirt. She would nod to an area and he would look at her tits through her white blouse.

Chris gritted his teeth as he pictured his fist smashing into Kyle's nose. Oddly enough, he felt possessive over Mya as she was being eye groped by this prick. If anyone was going to stare at her goods with such ownership, he wanted it to be him. That jealous idea bothered Chris a bit, however, it didn't stop him from having it.

Suddenly Mya's phone began to ring. She politely excused herself and left towards the hallway to take her call, leaving Kyle and Chris to make nice. After Kyle watched Mya's ass sway to the hallway, he looked over at the redhead with open lust.

"That's a Red I would like to be balls deep in," Kyle mused as his head cocked to the side to look at the redhead bending down to pick up a brush from the floor. "Right"

Kyle went to pat Chris on the shoulder.

Chris didn't want to be associated with this pig. He growled, "Don' touch me."

Kyle hand hovered over Chris's shoulder before slowly falling back to his side. Chris stared him down at the 2-inch advantage he had over Kyle. Kyle was taken aback by his tone but he didn't back down. He stared up at Chris, searching his eyes to see if this was all some type of joke. Chris's menacing glare suggested it wasn't.

Meanwhile, Mya had returned from her phone call. She uneasily looked back from Kyle and Chris in the midst of their staring contest. Tension swirled around them, making her uneasy and nervous.

"Okay, people! I'm ready to shoot," announced the skinny bald head photographer in dark shades and a leather jacket.

The threatening spell broken. Kyle turned to smile down at Mya. "Well, it looks like you have everything under control. I'll see you later, sweetheart, for a debriefing back at my office tonight."

Kyle briskly walked off. Mya watched Chris in surprise as he glared after Kyle's exit.

What was that all about? She thought.

The top photographer, Pierre Nuess, wore black slacks that were wrinkled and hung just above his brown flip-flops. He turned towards them and said, "Chris, darling, come here." He snapped his fingers.

Chris scrunched up his face and shook his head. "Nar. Try that again, mate," he warned the photographer. Obviously, not taking anyone's mess that afternoon.

"Chris, I need you to stand here, please," the pretentious photographer waved him over. "Come on, come on. Time is money, darling!"

Chris threw him a deadly look.

Before he could say anything, Mya moved in close to him and whispered, "Best behavior."

Chris gave a curt nod then, obeyed the photographer's direction.

As he snapped away with his camera, the photographer shot out phrases, such as:

"Give me animal magnetism."

"Seduce the camera."

"Yeah, you want it, don't you?"

"Try to take it."

"You want to taste it, don't you?"

"Give me a lick!"

and "Yeah make me want it, baby!"

Chris looked over at Mya's shaking shoulders of merriment. She could only picture the thoughts running through his mind.

After half an hour of verbal sexual abuse, Chris was allowed a small break. Ten minutes before, Mya had left the studio to complete another phone call.

Chris collapsed into the artist chair. Gina, the sexy redhead from earlier, covered his outfit with a paper towel and started retouching his makeup.

"You were doing great up there," she praised him as her brush swept over his brow.

"Oh, really I didn' notice," he said. "I was too busy feelin' like a piece of meat. I thought at one point he was goin' to tell me to pull down my pants and start a Playgirl photo shoot."

"That's something I would've liked to see," she smiled. Gina moved over to whisper in his ear, "In fact, we have some time if you would like to give me a private viewing."

Chris looked around for Mya. Strangely enough, he felt uncomfortable getting lucky with this bombshell with Mya only a few feet away. He had promised to behave and for some reason he wanted to obey that command from Mya.

"Oh, don't worry about your guard dog," Gina slyly grinned. "She's taking a call outside."

Chris weighed his options. On one hand, this is a very attractive redhead who was offering to put out. On the other hand, he had promised Mya to be good. Something deep inside him wanted to please her and not let her down.

Even though, the other day in Lou's office, he may have ruined his chances to sleep with her, a small part of him felt a bit guilty fooling around with someone while Mya was in the building. Yet, he did feel like he was owed something from this horrific photo shoot. Maybe a nice tug from a beautiful girl would hit the spot. A hand job was innocent, roigh?

After moment, Chris's conscience nagged at him: Don' do it. It was the first time his brain had won out over his penis.

"Maybe another time, possum," he said.

Feeling proud of himself and a bit shocked by turning down easy ass, Chris excused himself and went into his dressing room to put on his next outfit. He was down to his boxers when his dressing room door abruptly opened.

Chris turned around to see Gina. She quickly closed the door behind her.

"Did you need any help?" she moved closer to him. Her hands automatically going towards his waist.

"Nar, that's quite alroigh," Chris's hands reached up towards hers. "No need to trouble yourself."

"Oh, there's no trouble at all," she purred. Her fingers hooked on to the end of his boxers, sliding them past his waist

"None at all," she said as she sank down to her knees.

Chris gave out an embarrassed laugh and tried to pull up his boxers. Blood began to rush down to his cock.

"Don't be shy, honey," she sweetly mused. "Of what I can see, you never need to be shy."

"True blue, love, but..." he gave a quick laugh.

"Shhhh, it's okay. Let me take care of you."

Chris tried to pull her up to her feet again. He had to gain some control. His dick was getting rock hard at the prospect of a warm, wet mouth. It made Chris have some trouble focusing on doing the right thing. He tried to keep thinking about how pissed Mya would be if she found out about this blowjob.

Then, there was an interrupted knock on the door. Chris barely had enough time to pull his boxers back up when Mya walked into the room. Too shocked by the scene in front of her, she didn't have a chance to close the door behind her.

"It's not wha yoou think," Chris's hand gestured up at the same time the tight grip of the redhead's hands on his boxers had pulled his shorts down again. His hard, thick penis excitedly flung out from its confinement.

Mya's gasped surprise was echoed by the spectators behind her. Chris focused on her pissed off face while a few people took out their camera phones.

"I can't leave you alone for two minutes without your dick coming out!?!" Mya yelled at him.

Chapter Ten

"Chris Foley has done it again in a new sex scandal that went viral today as he was getting worked over by one of the staff at Pierre Nuess' top photographing studio."

A video shoot of the red-haired girl on her knees in front of Chris's dropped pants filled the screen. Mya turned the channel on her TV to a rerun of Living Single.

She sat in the tiny dining area of her Ladera Heights apartment off of Edgemar Ave. A fairly nice neighborhood that was still in her monetary budget.

In the 80s, Ladera Heights was known as the "Black" Beverly Hills Now, it was a bit rundown in certain spots and people were rebuilding beautiful homes that made the real estate property spike up.

Thinking about Chris's latest disaster, Mya placed a chilled glass of whiskey to her temple. Oh my God, she rolled her head along the cool crystal.

Promoting for Chris had proven to be a nightmare. She couldn't control him. And everything she tried to do to make him look better made him look worse.

He's a fucking train wreck, she bleakly thought.

Mya didn't know what to do. He had seemed like an okay guy. A little funny and rough around the edges but overall harmless. She was a bit surprise by his aggressive anger towards Kyle and Pierre.

But they were assholes. Maybe he sensed that or had old beefs with them. If anything, it proves Chris isn't fake. What you see, is what you get.

Unfortunately for Mya, she had seen too much of him this week. She also saw a handsome, sex god that had problems staying sober and out of trouble.

And he can't control his dick either!

Trying to distract herself from her impending career failure, Mya flipped through the new script by the up and coming writer/director, Paul Malcolm. She had read half of it and was in love. Mya knew this film could really be something with the right people.

She scrolled over her notes on people to contact and get a hold of so she could give the script to the right actors under the buzz of its production. This had been her only joy in this past week of disappointments.

Suddenly, her attention was pulled to a news clip of a famous actor talking about a documentary of the pollution in our world. Inspiration hit Mya. She turned on her laptop and started researching organizations that work to restore the environment.

After about an hour, there was a knock on her door. Surprised by who was coming to her place unannounced so late at night, she cautiously walked to the peephole. Mya cursed herself when she saw Chris on the other side of her door.

Chris looked nice in a pair of khakis and a white collared shirt. The top button was undone. And he had a puppy dog look on his tan face. If Mya wasn't so mad at him for that afternoon's shenanigans, she would have been very turned on right now.

Immediately, she thought about sneaking away and pretending she wasn't home.

"I know you're there. I can see your shadow underneath the door," he said through the door.

Begrudgingly, Maya opened it. Her arms folded. Her eyes coldly swept up his form.

"I wanted to explain about what happened earliah," he started.

"Save it. I don't care what you do with that thing," she pointed down at his crotch. "Just as long as it doesn't interfere with what I'm trying to do here. It just makes my job a lot harder. And how do you even know where I live?"

"I have friends," he shrugged. He didn't bother to mention his club friend, Raph, was the Houdini of finding lost pussy. Chris continued to say, "In this town, it's useful to know people who can get a hold of people."

"You have friends. That's a shock."

Ignoring her jab, he asked, "Can I come in?"

"No."

"Come on, please. Otherwise, I can' be responsible for the scene I'll make in the hallway."

With his current track record, Mya was actually afraid of what other bad press he could bring into her world.

"Come on then," she snapped and turned into her apartment.

"Cheers," he thanked her as he followed her in and surveyed the living room.

It was petite, yet warm, with its fluffy light blue sofa that took up most of the living room space. Behind the sofa was a small dining room, with a white round table which had room for two chairs. It led to a doorway to the kitchen that had an open counter.

Chris could see a green refrigerator and a cream-colored stove behind it. There was a tall gold lamp in the corner nearest to the tiny hallway leading to the front door where a coat rack and an umbrella stand were kept. The floor had brown carpet.

A wicker entertainment center stood against a way near an archway that Chris guessed led to the bedroom. Wha little secrets could I find in there? he wondered to himself. I'll have to explore that room latah.

Above the small 14" flat screen TV, he saw a framed poster of the film, Brown Sugar. Chris moved closer to the poster to read the signatures on it. It had been signed by Mos Def, Queen Latifah, Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan, and the director, Rick Famuyiwa.

"Crikey! How did yoou get this?" Chris said.

"I stood outside the premiere for hours. When the actors were leaving, I slipped near the exit door crowd and got autographs."

"That was hard core."

"Naw, the film wasn't that mainstream so it was easy to get to the actors. It's a shame. It was a great film. My favorite, in fact. It should have gotten a lot more coverage than it did."

After a moment, Chris watched a small smile spring to her lips. Then, she said, "This motivated me to get into the film industry. I want to get those great actors and films the coverage they deserve so more people will know about them."

Chris was pleased to see her face softened. She looked so pretty and comfortable in her own environment as she talked about something she loved.

Mya caught Chris staring at her with soft eyes and a gentle smile. She started feeling a bit uncomfortable by the way his innocent and friendly expression warmed her chest, as if he was an old friend coming by for a nice chat, rather than a difficult client coming to give another apology.

A bit calmer from when he first walked into her apartment, Mya asked him, "Would you like something to drink?"

Chris watched her walk back towards her small kitchen, and said, "Tequila, if yoou got it."

"I do not," she said sternly. Then she softened her tone when she offered him a beer instead.

"Full fat?"

"What?"

"Oh, huh, is it light?" he explained what he had meant.

"Yes, it's Bud Light."

"It will do," he frowned.

"Not too concerned about your figure, are you?" she asked as she handed him the beer.

"Cheers. Nar, when I'm not filmin, I don' bother with all that diet crap," he said. "I'll just work out durin' the hellish months before a big production to get back in shape."

Mya scanned down his flat stomach and pecks before she said, "Well, looks like you don't need to do too much to get back in shape. It can't be too hellish for you."

"Why, Miss Bassett, if I didn' know bettah, I would say that was a compliment," he cheered her with a raise of his beer bottle then he took a swig.

"Well, I have my moments," she smiled.

Chris casually looked around on her dining table which was full of papers that surrounded her small white APPLE MacBook.

"Was I interruptin' anythin'?" he asked

"Just going over some notes."

"On this script?" he asked as he picked up the curled booklet.

He sat at her table and read the title out loud: "'Bright Girl', writer/director Paul Malcolm."

"Hey, isn' he the one who directed Crumbling Oreo?" he asked.

"Yes, that's him," Mya was surprised that he had heard of an indie director. "How do you know about that?"

"I saw it at Sundance. It was amazin," he told her as she took a seat down at the table next to him. "Wha is it about?"

"It's about this biracial girl whose mom just died and her white father move them up to Oregon, where she's the only person of color in like a 100-mile radius. It's basically about her relationship with the people in that town and her father coming to terms with how he needs to raise a young woman."

"Well, not just any young woman. A black young woman as well," Chris pointed out. "I'm sure that's gonna have a lot of psychological and emotional turmoil goin' on."

He started scanning through the script.

Mya looked over at him in surprise. She didn't think he would have any idea about the race psychology involved in American society. Most white men had no idea about what the typical person of color had to deal with in this world. Many white people had one world to deal with while the other races had at least two. And in each world, the color of your skin presents a struggle of acceptance by society and by themselves which has a very defining point in their identity. Somehow understanding that distinct issue made her more attracted to him.

"Whoever plays these roles hava have really good actin chops. Heaps of different, unsaid emotions. Parts like these that I.., Chris finally noticed Mya staring at him.

He looked into her dark chocolate pools. Besides looking impressed, they glowed.

His voice lowered as he tried to continue his sentence, "I would love to be in somethin that charged an emotion other than pure sex and adrenaline."

Although, hearing how his deep husky voice said 'pure sex' had curled her toes, it farther turned Mya on seeing this different side of him. She knew he was a goofball and looked sexy as hell. But tonight, he had showed her that he was intelligent. He was articulate, and empathetic to her culture's struggles as well as talking about taking his career more seriously.

Chris seemed more mature and responsible. It heightened his good looks, knowing there was something deeper in him. Mya's eyes began to cloud with desire.

Suddenly she had realized that she was sat very close to him. A sensual vibe radiated off him. She could breathe in his lavender scent. Mya felt relaxed and calm as if she could easily do anything she wanted to do.

Her eyes flickered down to his plump, rosy lips. They parted a little. He kept talking as they moved down towards hers. "Give the audience somethin' real to.."

He stopped right before her mouth.

"...to taste," he finished his sentence before his finger raised her chin so his lips could lightly brush across her mouth.

Then, Chris captured her in the kiss. His arms embraced her back, pushing her closer to him. With her eyes closed, Mya's hands swept into his short blond hair.

His lips were soft, but firm. She felt him seductively suck on her bottom lip with eager tenderness.

After tasting her thick lips, his satin tongue plunged into her mouth. Mya's neck grew hot as their tongues slipped around each other in a sensual dance.

He kisses so well, she thought.

Next, his hand slipped around her chest and started rubbing her left breast over her shirt. Mya's nipples perked up in excitement. Her moistened vagina started to quiver in need.

Chris lifted his mouth from hers to trail tiny kisses down her neck. The light touches sent electric waves down her body. Mya wrapped her arms tighter around his neck as she nibbled at his ear. She wanted to get closer to him to feel his anaconda rub on her clit.

Mya knew she shouldn't be kissing him. He was a player. She was just another notch on his belt.

But his hands and his lips feel so good! her pussy pulsated at her. Make him come down here for a bit.

No, I can't have sex with him. It's too soon. She argued with her hole. No, I mean, it's wrong, right?

In an effort to gain some control, Mya opened her eyes. They landed on a teaser for a news clip of Chris with his pants down in the dressing room. She immediately closed her eyes to try to block it out while he licked at the base of her neck. His mouth moved back to hers. She tasted him deeply.

However, now she was picturing that red-haired slut on her knees with Chris's cock coming out. That girl would forever be known as the girl who got caught giving head to Chris Foley. Even after her fifteen minutes of fame was over, she would never be taken seriously in this city again. Actors, models, etc. would expect her to go down on them. Mya didn't want that to be her fate. A coldness came over her.

"Fuck, no. I can't," Mya said.

Her senses coming back to her. She pulled away from a horny, dazed Chris.

"Wha? Wha?" he asked. "Wha's wrong?"

"I can't do this," she lifted from the dining room table's chair to get some distance between them.

"Nar, nar, sure yoou can," he tried to convince her. His hands grabbed her hips and tried to pull her back down.

"We work together," she said.

Chris shrugged his shoulders. Mya quickly moved out of his grip and walked to the living room.

With space between us, he can't grab me and force me to do anything I'm not willing to do, she thought.

"It's unprofessional," she tried again in a slow low tone.

Chris quickly got up and shook his head. He walked over to her and said, "Yoou know it'll be okay. I can completely be professional afterwards."

His hands flew up to her face. His lips pressed together as they descended down to her mouth.

Mya stepped out of his reach as he went for another kiss.

"I think we should call it a night," she said as she opened her front door.

Her eyes were cast down without the strength to look back up at his face.

After a long silence, Mya feared he wouldn't leave. She was afraid that she might have to fight him off like she had tried to do with Kyle. Her belly gave painful spasms of panic of what Chris might force her to do.

Chris gave a defeated sigh and said, "Okay."

He walked to the door, then stopped right in front of Mya. Relieved that he wouldn't force himself on her, she still refused to look at him. Mya didn't have the strength to stop him again. Her body wanted him as her mind and heart screamed that it was a bad idea.

She knew they would end up in her bedroom if she gave him a chance to kiss her again. It wasn't worth letting her career go to ruins for a one-night stand.

No matter how incredible it could have been, she thought.

"I guess I'll see yoou latah, boss", Chris said.

Then he moved in closer, trying once more to kiss her mouth. Sensing the movement, Mya quickly turned her head to the side.

Her heart raced as Chris's face loomed in front of hers. He stared at her for a few more long moments. The heat of his hands and mouth were still fresh on her body. Mya forcefully slowed her breathing while her heart raced in her chest.

Fear of what he would do to her was mixed with a desire to have his experienced touch on her. She was in confused turmoil.

Suddenly, Chris leaned in closer and placed a quick soft kiss on Mya's cheek.

"Sleep tight," he said as he coolly walked into the quiet hallway of her apartment complex.

Chapter Eleven

Chris sat next to Mya in the small nonprofit office of Global Clean. It was an organization dedicated to water conservation throughout the world. They cleaned oceans, shores, held fundraisers, passed out bottle water in Flint, Michigan, and etc. Chris liked what the organization did and he was happy to be a part of something so important.

Yet, he was failing desperately at his attempt to block out Thursday night's kiss with Mya. He had even gone as far as to go through his phone for a few nice sexual distractions.

However, when he had started making arrangements for girls to come over. He had stopped himself. His heart. Well, his penis wasn't in it.

All he wanted to do the whole weekend was to see Mya and continue where they had left off the other night. One of her big breasts in his hand. Her tongue roaming down his chest. His dick deep inside her mouth as her thick lips wrapped around the base of his cock. He wanted to nibble at her shoulder before working his mouth down to her nipple.

The memory of her sweet taste and soft skin aroused him even now as she sat there near him. When she crossed her legs in her purple linen skirt, Chris saw a flash of upper leg. Her thick, dark caramel thigh almost made him lose all resistance. He readjusted himself in his chair, excited by the image of pulling up her skirt and having her right there on that office desk.

Keep it professional, he reminded himself.  Behave, he told himself the same words echoed to him earlier last week. Chris was afraid that too much time alone with her would make that command hard to obey.

He figured if he couldn't satisfy her in the bedroom, he would have to do it by pleasing her in his work performance. Chris had made the decision to cooperate. This way he could help her job become easy. He wanted to please Mya. Somehow, it made him feel good to help her.

And it made sense for him to have a better image as well. Maybe he could finally stop doing films that were romantic comedies or action film franchises. He was sick of that. He was starting to feel like a piece of meat that stood around saying a few lines.

Chris had not gotten into acting for that. He wanted to act, and maybe having a better image would get him the parts to show the world what he could do.

"Let's see what we have for you," said John Augustus, director of Global Clean nonprofit organization. He flipped through a clipboard of paper and scanned down the lines of charitable activities that were in need of volunteers. Then he said, "We need people to make signs for..."

"Nar, I don' draw."

"You can write congress..."

"Nope."

"How about cleaning up the plastic bags in the ocean?"

"Nar."

After the tenth "no", Mya glared at Chris. Chris looked back at her in surprise. Frustrated to make her happy without going out of his comfort zone, Chris sat up and addressed the director.

"Look, can' I just give yoou some money or somethin'?" he asked after an exhausted breath.

"No, that would be beside the point," Mya turned to him. She tried unsuccessfully to keep her tone gentle as she spoke to him. "You want to show you actually care to be involved in something positive for the planet."

It was the first few sentences she had shared with him all day. Most of their time together she would speak to someone else, or answer him with "yes" or "no". Chris hated how closed off she was with him.

Before, she was snappy with comebacks and insults and the occasional order. Now, she spoke to him like she didn't want to be in the same room with him. That made Chris feel terrible.

"Well, I'm an actor, roigh?" Chris asked. "Shouldn' I be doin' some promo commercials to bring awareness of this water problem?"

"Well, um...," John started uncomfortably.

Mya quickly interrupted him by saying, "We feel that, for right now, it would be best to show your contribution in a more hands-on manner then after a bit of time..."

"We could have you do a few commercials," John jumped in. "You know until the public eye sees you as..."

"Somethin' othah than a fuckin' playboy!" Chris angrily finished John's sentence for him. John paled as Chris continued. "That's bullshit. I'm here to help. I should be usin' my popularity to show more awareness of wha is goin' on with this organization. I'm not some Average Joe nobody who's goin' to shuffle around in a dingy ass boat pickin up trash."

"Maybe, we got off on the wrong foot here," Mya tried to diffuse the situation.

"Show me the roigh fuckin' foot and stop insultin' me," he snapped at her and got up to leave. "I don' have to put up with this shit. If yoou don' want my help, fine. Clean up your own bloody oceans."

Outside in the parking lot, Mya caught up to him and shouted, "What the hell is your problem?"

"My problem? I'm the one who was insulted here. They just basically said I'm too dirty to represent their company."

"Oh no, they didn't!" she said. "Stop being so dramatic."

"I... if yoouv not notice I'm an actor," he gestured his hand up and down his body. "And as an actor, drama is part of my occupation."

Suddenly, Mya snapped. "You know, I've had it up to here with your 'I'm-too-good-for-everything-easy-going-whatever-I-want' attitude!" That was the last straw for Mya. She felt like he needed a come to Jesus moment. "You say you're an actor. You couldn't act your way out of a paper bag."

She grabbed her keys from her purse while Chris turned his head up to the sky and rolled his eyes. He looked back down at her with his mouth opened to speak.

Mya stopped him from talking by getting into his face, "No, shut up! Listen. Should I go over your list of accomplishments, great actor? 'Let it Ride'!?! Oh, that was a pivoted role where you played a gangster that fell in love with a cocktail waitress. How long did you have to train to play poker and make love in a casino?"

Mya walked off towards her parked blue Toyota Corolla.

"That was my first movie as the lead," he shouted at her retreating back.

"Oh and 'Starcrossed'," she turned around to him with her keys jingling in her hands. "You were an astronomer who never talked about constellations during the many kissing scenes you played on rooftops. That must of taken a lot of skill. I'm surprised that the Stars' Guild isn't knocking down your door to get you in the Actors Studio!"

"You certainly nevah complained about how I kiss," he threw back at her.

Mya scuffed at the low blow. Then she said, "You know, you want to be taken seriously and be this great actor, but you keep doing roles that don't require any acting."

"I'm not given scripts othah than for rom-coms and action films!"

"You know why!?!" she yelled. "It's because the public only sees you as sex appeal. How is anyone going to take you seriously? Or how are you going to make others take an organization serious when you are the quick fuck of Hollywood?"

"Oh, behave!" he shouted back. "Nar one cares."

Mya shook her head at him and said, "I'm trying to give them something else, but you're not helping. You have all these affairs without a care. You need to realize that you need to be humble. Look at Hugh Grant and Jude Law. After their sex scandals, they were apologetic and calm. Within a year, Hollywood had forgiven them and they were starring in great roles again."

"Don' compare me to those fairy Pommies. I not fuckin' British!" Chris spat back.

"Not the point," Mya said. "Stop showing the paparazzi, the press, and Hollywood this drunk, horny guy."

"That's all yoou think I am!?! Some guy who just goes around gettin' laid all the time," he said in slow anger.

Chris had gone through this to please her, but now, he could give a fuck what Mya wanted him to do. She was shitting all over his work.

Fuck her! He angrily thought. No ass is worth this!

"Well, yeah, how is the public supposed to trust in you if you just give it away to every piece of ass that comes your way."

Chris glared down at Mya for a moment. Then he asked, "How's the public supposed to, or how are yoou supposed to?"

"This is not about me," Mya denied.

"Aye, isn' it!?! Isn' this about your career and how yoou can make me look good so yoou can get a bettah group of clientele? Yoou could give a fuck wha I do, remember. Just as long as I don' mess up your hard work of makin' me look 'professional'."

"You're a fucking child. I'm so tired of trying to clean up your mess," she turned and got into her car. From over her shoulder, she shouted, "Why don't you go fuck that red head on a TMZ reporter's desk? It will save them the trouble of having to pay someone for their camera phone!"

He had had it. He didn't need her.

Chris walked up to her car door as she started the engine. "Yoou tired of cleanin up my shit!?! Why don' I make it easiah for yoou?" he yelled at her. "You're fuckin' fired!"

"Good, now I can finally get the fuck away from you!" she said as she drove off.

Shit. Shit, she cursed herself. Her last chance to get ahead in this town was angrily staring back at her in the rearview mirror.

Book 2: Roll Sound

Excerpt from

HOLLYWOOD

Demands

BOOK 2:

Roll Sound!

Chapter One

Mya Bassett stood in the middle of Kyle Ross's office in the Iris PR Firm office building on Hollywood Blvd. Her fingers fidgeted with a ballpoint pen as Kyle coldly stared at her from his glass desk. His tan face seemed calm. Yet, his brown eyes revealed his true raw emotion. They chilled Mya to the bone during the long silence that had fell between them.

"Let me get this straight," Kyle abruptly stood up.

Mya jumped in fear of what he would do. It wouldn't be the first time he had laid a hand on her. Except this time, it wouldn't be the beginning of his sick version of foreplay. Something he hadn't done since they dated two years ago.

Kyle slowly walked around his desk. He spoke calmly as he approached her. "In a space of a week, you have shown the world that heartthrob, Australian actor, Chris Foley, is a wimp at rugby, asks makeup artists to place their mouth on his dick, and has pissed off a charity. This drunk slut of Hollywood, then fired you."

He stopped in front of Mya. His 6' lean muscle frame loomed over her. It was only a 5 foot difference, but at that moment Mya felt like it might as well have been a 100-foot difference. Her eyes watered while panic vibrated through her limbs, making her face hot.

Suddenly, Kyle grabbed a handful of her black, curly hair and yanked her face up to him. His other hand wrapped a vice grip around her round cheeks and pointed chin. Pain stung Mya's scalp. She couldn't wiggle out of his hold. The fright of his violence silenced her.

Through clenched teeth, he spat out, "He is connected to our biggest client, Susan Dunee. For some reason that bitch thought it would be a good idea for you to help out her ex-boyfriend. And now, not only have you lost him. You may have lost our top earner!"

Kyle's perfectly manicured fingers dug into her brown skin. "What have I told you? 'Wine and dine the client. Do whatever it takes.'"

His hands let go of her face and hair. Then, in one swift motion, he had turned her around and roughly pushed her towards his closed office door. Mya cried out as her body slammed against it.

She half expected Kyle to lift up her skirt and punish her by sticking into her dry area. Mya held tight to her pen, ready to strike out before he could have a chance to tear away her panties.

Instead, Kyle hissed, "Now go out there and get him back. I don't care if you have to do a train on him with some homeless skank. Do whatever it takes."

A moment later, Mya was in the elevator with Chris Foley. He was doing a stand-up 69 with her office nemesis, Angie Guttuso. Her skirt swung over her stomach as her blond hair dangled down, sweeping back and forth like a mop across the floor.

Chris lifted his blond head from between her long legs. He flashed Mya a charming smile and beckoned her over with a raise of his chiseled chin and jawline.

"Trade places with me so I can take ya from behind," he said while he worked one hand on unbuckling his belt.

Mya screamed out in horror. Her eyes snapped open and scanned her darkened bedroom. She took in a deep long breath to calm her racing heart.

Then, she reached for a bottle of water near her bedside table. After a long drink, she breathed slowly in relief of only experiencing a bad dream.

Chapter Two

After having a day to cool off, Mya knew she had to get Chris to rehire her. The nightmare from last night had scared her from telling Kyle that she had been fired. Mya would try a few things before telling him the truth.

Also she felt bad about the other day. Mya had regretted all the hateful things she had told Chris in the parking lot of Global Clean. After their failed meeting with the director of the envirnomental group, Mya had cursed him out. She had told him that his career was a joke and that he was a terrible actor. Mya remembered seeing the hurt in his eyes and she felt terrible for being the one to cause it.

In truth, Chris could be a good guy. He wasn't that bad, Mya thought.

She remembered the night she had first met the 6' 2 Australian hottie. At the American Cancer Society's Gourmet Garden Party, he had made her heart quickened with his charming wink and flirty playfulness.

Well, until he had brushed me off for a Supermodel, Mya thought. And ripped my dress in the process.

She was able to laugh about it now but at that moment she had almost died. Later, they had ended the night, lurking in the shadows. He was hiding her from the press. He didn't have to do that.

Mya immediately thought about how close they had been to each other that night. He could have taken advantage of their close proximity and kissed her then. Mya probably wouldn't have stopped him. Yet, he hadn't taken advantage, Chris's eyes had asked for her permission and when he wasn't given it he backed away.

Like a gentleman, Mya was surprised to say.

The other week in her apartment Chris hadn't pressed her there, either. He could have forced more kissing on her and persuaded her to move them into her bedroom.

It wouldn't have taken too much more persuading, she thought. Mya's body heated at the memory of that kiss.

Chris had respected her wishes to stop when she had put her foot down. Mya had been with sleazy guys who had tried a lot more. Kyle had to hear "no" a multiple of tines and receive slaps across the face before he stopped. He would leave in a huff. Like he had been wronged in some way.

Chris was different. At the rugby match, he had been beaten down repeatedly, but he had still remained a good sport. He had only complained a bit in his sarcastic remarks a few days later. Most actors would be having a fit and calling their lawyers the minute someone tackled them.

Also, he had apologized for almost receiving a blowjob from the makeup artist at the photo shoot. Mya hadn't wanted to hear the explanation for that one.

He was Hollywood's player. A girl in every club/bar/restaurant/movie set type of man. Could Mya expect anything less than Chris scoring in the most inopportune places?

Mya realized that she was stretching at this point. She shook her head from her flimsy reasoning.

Chris isn't saint but he has some good qualities, she thought. If only I can show the public that. I can clean up his image and get him the positive press to make his career rise.

I've been going about this the wrong way. We need to give the public something genuine. Something to show better than what they've been seeing on entertainment television.

Mya started working on a plan to get her job back and to get Chris the good press he needed.

After the hundredth ignored phone call she had placed to Chris's cell, Mya quickly phoned Lou Garner, Chris's lousy agent. She found out from him that Chris had went up to his house in San Francisco for the weekend. Lou gave her the address to his place in the Marina District.

Next, Mya did some research on Chris. Other than the entertainment buzz around his favorite clubs and hot affairs, Mya found out he liked surfing, he was from Melbourne, and his favorite band was a 90s Australian band called "The Vines".

Mya made a few phone calls in the bay before catching a plane up north.

"Wha the fuck are yoou doin' here?" Chris asked from his open front door.
