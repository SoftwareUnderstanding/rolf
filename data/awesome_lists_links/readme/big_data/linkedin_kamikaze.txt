What is Kamikaze
===============

Kamikaze is a utility package wrapping set implementations on document lists. 

It also implements the PForDelta compression algorithm for sorted integer segments to enable Inverted List compression for search engines like Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_5_1/core/org/apache/lucene/util/PForDeltaDocIdSet.html). 

Kamikaze is based on the PForDelta algorithm proposed in the following paper:
