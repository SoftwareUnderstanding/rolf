![Tigon Logo](/tigon-docs/developer-guide/source/_images/tigon.png)

**Introduction**

**Tigon** is an open-source, real-time, low-latency, high-throughput stream processing framework.

Tigon is a collaborative effort between Cask Data, Inc. and AT&T that combines 
technologies from these companies to create a disruptive new framework to handle a diverse
set of real-time streaming requirements.

Cask Data has built technology that provides scalable, reliable, and persistent high-throughput
event processing with high-level Java APIs using Hadoop and HBase.

AT&T has built a streaming engine that provides massively scalable, flexible, and in-memory
low-latency stream processing with a SQL-like query Language.

Together, they have combined to create **Tigon**.

There are many applications that can take advantage of its features:

- Ability to handle extremely large data flows;
- Exactly-once event processing using an app-level Java API with consistency, reliability, and persistence;
- Streaming database using a SQL-like language to filter, group and join data streams in-memory;
- Runs collections of queries using pipelined query plans;
- Able to transparently handle complex record routing in large parallelized implementations;
- Runs and scales as a native Apache Hadoop YARN Application;
- Reads, writes, and tightly integrates with HDFS and HBase;
- Supports a significant amount of parallelization;
- Fault-tolerance and horizontal scalability without burdening the developer;
- Enterprise security features with debugging, logging, and monitoring tools; and
- Simpler programming model, tools and UI; and
- Open-source software and development process.

### Prerequisites

Tigon is supported on *NIX systems such as Linux and Macintosh OS X.
It is not supported on Microsoft Windows.

To install and use Tigon and its included examples, there are a few prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 or JDK 7 (required to run Tigon; note that $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. GCC
  3. G++
  4. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)
  
Note: To run the TigonSQL Stream Engine outside of Tigon, libz, Perl 5.x, and Python 3.x are required.

### Download

Pre-compiled sources and related files can be downloaded in a zip file: 
[tigon-developer-release-0.2.0.zip.](http://repository.cask.co/downloads/co/cask/tigon/tigon-developer-release/0.2.0/tigon-developer-release-0.2.0.zip)

### Install 

Once the download has completed, unzip the file in a suitable location.

### Run Instructions

To run Tigon in standalone mode:

    $ run_standalone.sh <path-to-flow-jar> <flow-class-name> <run-time-args>

To run Tigon in distributed mode:

    $ run_distributed.sh <zookeeper-quorum> <hdfs-namespace>

### Building from Source

You can also build Tigon directly from the latest source code:

    git clone https://github.com/caskdata/tigon.git
    cd tigon
    mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdist

After the build completes, you will have a distribution of Tigon under the
`tigon-distribution/target/` directory.  

Take the `tigon-sdk-<version>.zip` file and unzip it into a suitable location.

bug reports, submitting pull requests for code changes and improvements, or by asking questions and
assisting others on the mailing list.

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Bugs and tasks are tracked in a public JIRA issue tracker. Details on access will be forthcoming.

### Pull Requests

We have a simple pull-based development model with a consensus-building phase, similar to Apache's
voting process. If you’d like to help make Tigon better by adding new features, enhancing existing
features, or fixing bugs, here's how to do it:

1. If you are planning a large change or contribution, discuss your plans on the `cask-tigon-dev`
   mailing list first.  This will help us understand your needs and best guide your solution in a
   way that fits the project.
2. Fork Tigon into your own GitHub repository.
3. Create a topic branch with an appropriate name.
4. Work on the code to your heart's content.
5. Once you’re satisfied, create a pull request from your GitHub repo (it’s helpful if you fill in
   all of the description fields).
6. After we review and accept your request, we’ll commit your code to the cask/tigon
   repository.
