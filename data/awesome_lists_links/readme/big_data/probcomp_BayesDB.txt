BayesDB
=======

This repository contained a previous implementation of BayesDB which
has been replaced by the new implementation Bayeslite. For the new
repository, visit https://github.com/probcomp/bayeslite. For

BayesDB, a Bayesian database, lets users query the probable
implications of their data as easily as a SQL database lets them query
the data itself. Using the built-in Bayesian Query Language (BQL),
users with no statistics training can solve basic data science
problems, such as detecting predictive relationships between
variables, inferring missing values, simulating probable observations,
and identifying statistically similar database entries.
