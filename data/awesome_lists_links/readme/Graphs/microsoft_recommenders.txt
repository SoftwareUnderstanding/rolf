# Recommenders

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/badge/?version=latest)](https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## What's New (January 13, 2022)

We have a new release [Recommenders 1.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/releases/tag/1.0.0)! The codebase has now migrated to TensorFlow versions 2.6 / 2.7 and to Spark version 3. In addition, there are a few changes in the dependencies and extras installed by `pip` (see [this guide](recommenders/README.md#optional-dependencies)). We have also made improvements in the code and the CI / CD pipelines.

Starting with release 0.6.0, Recommenders has been available on PyPI and can be installed using pip! 

Here you can find the PyPi page: https://pypi.org/project/recommenders/

Here you can find the package documentation: https://microsoft-recommenders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Introduction

This repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:

- [Prepare Data](examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommender algorithm
- [Model](examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommender algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).
- [Evaluate](examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics
- [Model Select and Optimize](examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommender models
- [Operationalize](examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure

Several utilities are provided in [recommenders](recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).

## Getting Started

Please see the [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details on setting up your machine locally, on a [data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) or on [Azure Databricks](SETUP.md#setup-guide-for-azure-databricks).

The installation of the recommenders package has been tested with 
- Python versions 3.6 - 3.9 and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html#) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment)

and currently does not support version 3.8 and above. It is recommended to install the package and its dependencies inside a clean environment (such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html#)).

To set up on your local machine:

* To install core utilities, CPU-based algorithms, and dependencies:

    1. Ensure software required for compilation and Python libraries
       is installed.

       + On Linux this can be supported by adding:

         ```bash
         sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libpython<version>
         ``` 

         where `<version>` should be the Python version (e.g. `3.6`).

       + On Windows you will need [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

    2. Create a conda or virtual environment.  See the
       [setup guide](SETUP.md) for more details.

    3. Within the created environment, install the package from
       [PyPI](https://pypi.org):

       ```bash
       pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install --upgrade setuptools
       pip install recommenders[examples]
       ```

    4. Register your (conda or virtual) environment with Jupyter:

       ```bash
       python -m ipykernel install --user --name my_environment_name --display-name "Python (reco)"
       ```

    5. Start the Jupyter notebook server

       ```bash
       jupyter notebook
       ```

    6. Run the [SAR Python CPU MovieLens](examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb)
       notebook under the `00_quick_start` folder.  Make sure to
       change the kernel to "Python (reco)".

* For additional options to install the package (support for GPU,
  Spark etc.) see [this guide](recommenders/README.md).

**NOTE** - The [Alternating Least Squares (ALS)](examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) notebooks require a PySpark environment to run. Please follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to run these notebooks in a PySpark environment. For the deep learning algorithms, it is recommended to use a GPU machine and to follow the steps in the [setup guide](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) to set up Nvidia libraries.

**NOTE for DSVM Users** - Please follow the steps in the [Dependencies setup - Set PySpark environment variables on Linux or MacOS](SETUP.md#dependencies-setup) and [Troubleshooting for the DSVM](SETUP.md#troubleshooting-for-the-dsvm) sections if you encounter any issue.

**DOCKER** - Another easy way to try the recommenders repository and get started quickly is to build [docker images](tools/docker/README.md) suitable for different environments.

### Algorithm Comparison

We provide a [benchmark notebook](examples/06_benchmarks/movielens.ipynb) to illustrate how different algorithms could be evaluated and compared. In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.
