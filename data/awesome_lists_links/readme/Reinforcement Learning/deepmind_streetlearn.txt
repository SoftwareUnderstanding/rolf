# StreetLearn

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the
[**StreetLearn**](http://streetlearn.cc) C++ engine and Python environment for training navigation agents in real-world photographic street environments, as well as code for implementing the agents used in [1] ["Learning to Navigate in Cities Without a Map"](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7509-learning-to-navigate-in-cities-without-a-map) (NeurIPS 2018). This environment was also used in two follow-up papers: [2] ["Cross-View Policy Learning for Street Navigation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05930) (ICCV 2019) and [3] ["Learning to follow directions in Street View"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00401) (AAAI 2020), as well as in technical report [4] ["The StreetLearn Environment and Dataset"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01292). The StreetLearn environment relies on panorama images from
[Google Street View](https://maps.google.com) and provides an interface for
moving a first-person view agent inside the Street View graph. This is not an
officially supported Google product. Please cite papers [1] and [4] if you use the code from this repository in your work.

Our papers [1], [2] and [3] also provide a detailed description of how to train and implement navigation agents in the StreetLearn environment by using a TensorFlow implementation of "Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures", published in Espeholt, Soyer, Munos et al. (2018) ["IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561)). The generic agent and trainer code have been published by Lasse Espeholt under an Apache license at:
[https://github.com/deepmind/scalable_agent](https://github.com/deepmind/scalable_agent).

### Code structure

This environment code contains:

*   **streetlearn/engine** Our C++ StreetLearn engine for loading, caching and
    serving Google Street View panoramas by projecting them from a
    equirectangular representation to first-person projected view at a given
    yaw, pitch and field of view, and for handling navigation (moving from one
    panorama to another) depending on the city street graph and the current
    orientation.
*   **streetlearn/proto** The message
    [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) used to
    store panoramas and street graph.
*   **streetlearn/python/environment** A Python-based interface for calling the
    StreetLearn environment with custom action spaces. Within the Python
    StreetLearn interface, several games are defined in individual files whose
    names end with **game.py**. A second interface, called
    **BatchedStreetLearn**, can be used to instantiate multiple StreetLearn
    environments that share the same action specs, observation specs, and
    panorama cache, and return observations in batched format.
*   **streetlearn/python/ui** A simple interactive **human_agent** and an
    **oracle_agent** and **instruction_following_oracle_agent** for courier and
    instruction-following tasks respectively; all agents are implemented in
    Python using pygame and instantiate the StreetLearn environment on the
    requested map, along with a simple user interface. The interactive
    **human_agent** enables a user to play various games. The **oracle_agent**
    and **instruction_following_oracle_agent** are similar to the human agent
    and automatically navigate towards the goal (courier game) or towards the
    goal via waypoints, following instructions (instruction-following game) and
    they report oracle performance on these tasks. A batched version of th
    oracle agent can be started using **batched_oracle_agent**.

[This page](https://bazel.build/) describes how to install the Bazel build and
test tool on your machine. We currently support Bazel versions up to 0.24.0,
whose installation instructions are listed on [this page](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html) under section `Using the binary installer` (copy-pasted below):

```shell
wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.24.0/bazel-0.24.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x bazel-0.24.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
./bazel-0.24.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh  --user
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
```

### Building StreetLearn

Clone this repository and install
[Scalable Agent](https://github.com/deepmind/scalable_agent):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/streetlearn.git
cd streetlearn
sh get_scalable_agent.sh
```

To build the StreetLearn engine only:

```shell
export CLIF_PATH=$HOME/opt
bazel build streetlearn:streetlearn_engine_py
```

To build the human agent and the oracle agent in the StreetLearn environment,
with all the dependencies:

```shell
export CLIF_PATH=$HOME/opt
bazel build streetlearn/python/ui:all
```

## Running the StreetLearn human agent

To run the human agent using one of the StreetLearn datasets downloaded and
stored at **dataset_path** (note that **dataset_path** needs to be absolute, not relative):

```shell
bazel run streetlearn/python/ui:human_agent -- --dataset_path=<dataset_path>
```

For help with the options of the human_agent:

```shell
bazel run streetlearn/python/ui:human_agent -- --help
```

Similarly, to run the oracle agent on the courier game:

```shell
bazel run streetlearn/python/ui:oracle_agent -- --dataset_path=<dataset_path>
```

The human agent and the oracle agent show a **view_image** (on top) and a
**graph_image** (on bottom).

Note: you need to add the following line to your `.bashrc` script to avoid specifying the CLIF path each time you open a new terminal:

```shell
export CLIF_PATH=$HOME/opt
```

### Actions available to an agent:

*   Rotate left or right in the panorama, by a specified angle (change the yaw
    of the agent). In the human_agent, press **a** or **d**.
*   Rotate up or down in the panorama, by a specified angle (change the pitch of
    the agent). In the human_agent, press **w** or **s**.
*   Move from current panorama A forward to another panorama B if the current
    bearing of the agent from A to B is within a tolerance angle of 30 degrees.
    In the human_agent, press **space**.
*   Zoom in and out in the panorama. In the human_agent, press **i** or **o**.

Additional keys for the human_agent are **escape** and **p** (to print the
current view as a bitmap image).

For training RL agents, action spaces are discretized using integers. For
instance, in our paper, we used 5 actions: (move forward, turn left by 22.5 deg,
turn left by 67.5 deg, turn right by 22.5 deg, turn right by 67.5 deg).

### Navigation Bar

Along the bottom of the **view_image** is the navigation bar which displays a
small circle in any direction in which travel is possible:

*   When within the centre range, they will turn green meaning the user can move
    in this direction.
*   When they are out of this range, they will turn red meaning this is
    inaccessible.
*   When more than one dots are within the centre range, all except the most
    central will turn orange, meaning that there are multiple (forward)
    directions available.

### Stop signs

The graph is constructed by breadth first search to the depth specified by the
graph depth flags. At the maximum depth the graph will suddenly stop, generally
in the middle of a street. Because we are trying to train agents to recognize
streets as navigable, and in order not to confuse the agents, red stop signs are
shown from two panoramas away from any terminal node in the graph.

### Obtaining the StreetLearn dataset

You can request the StreetLearn dataset on the [StreetLearn project website](https://sites.google.com/view/streetlearn/). The following datasets are currently distributed:
* 56k Manhattan panoramas, used [1], [2], [3] and [4]:
** **manhattan_highres** (size 1632 x 408)
** **manhattan_lowres** (size 408 x 204)
* 58k Pittsburgh panoramas, used in [2], [3] and [4]:
** **pittsburgh_highres** (size 1632 x 408)
** **pittsburgh_lowres** (size 408 x 204)
* 29k Manhattan panoramas used in [5] ["TOUCHDOWN: Natural Language Navigation and Spatial Reasoning in Visual Street Environments"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Chen_TOUCHDOWN_Natural_Language_Navigation_and_Spatial_Reasoning_in_Visual_Street_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) (Chen, Suhr, Misra et al, ICCV 2019), with accompanying code at [https://github.com/lil-lab/touchdown](https://github.com/lil-lab/touchdown):
** **touchdown_manhattan_highres** (size 3000 x 1500)
** **touchdown_manhattan_lowres** (downsampled to 500 x 250)

The downsampled version of the panoramas can be used when the RGB inputs are small (e.g., 84 x 84), to save on panorama image loading and projection time.

## Using the StreetLearn environment code

The Python StreetLearn environment follows the specifications from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/). The call to function **step(action)** returns:
* **observation** (tuple of observations requested at construction),
* **reward** (a float with the current reward of the agent),
* **done** (boolean indicating whether the episode has ended)
* and **info** (a dictionary of environment state variables).
After creating the environment, it is initialised by calling function **reset()**. If the flag auto_reset is set to True at construction, **reset()** will be called automatically every time that an episode ends.

    direction to be taken by the agent in order to follow a shortest path to the
    next goal or waypoint. This observation should be requested only for agents
    trained using imitation learning.

### Games

The following games are available in the StreetLearn environment:

*   **coin_game**: invisible coins scattered throughout the map, yielding a
    reward of 1 for each. Once picked up, these rewards do not reappear until
    the end of the episode.
*   **courier_game**: the agent is given a goal destination, specified as
    lat/long pairs. Once the goal is reached (with 100m tolerance), a new goal
    is sampled, until the end of the episode. Rewards at a goal are proportional
    to the number of panoramas on the shortest path from the agent's position
    when it gets the new goal assignment to that goal position. Additional
    reward shaping consists in early rewards when the agent gets within a range
    of 200m of the goal. Additional coins can also be scattered throughout the
    environment. The proportion of coins, the goal radius and the early reward
    radius are parametrizable.
*   **curriculum_courier_game**: same as the courier game, but with a curriculum
    on the difficulty of the task (maximum straight-line distance from the
    agent's position to the goal when it is assigned).
*   **goal_instruction_game** and its variations
    **incremental_instruction_game** and **step_by_step_instruction_game** use
    navigation instructions to direct agents to a goal. Agents are provided with
    a list of instructions as well as thumbnails that guide the agent from its
    starting position to the goal location. In
    **step_by_step_instruction_game**, agents are provided one instruction and
    two thumbnails at a time, in the other game variants the whole list is
    available throughout the whole game. Reward is granted upon reaching the
    goal location (all variants), as well as when hitting individual waypoints
    (**incremental_instruction_game** and **step_by_step_instruction_game**
    only). During training various curriculum strategies are available to the
    agents, and reward shaping can be employed to provide fractional rewards
    when the agent gets within a range of 50m of a waypoint or goal.
