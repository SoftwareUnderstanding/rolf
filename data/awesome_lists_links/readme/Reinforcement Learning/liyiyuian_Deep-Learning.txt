# Introduction
Here collects my study notes, including programming languages, deep learning / machine learning papers, mathematical simulation notes, from a biochem major perspective.

# AWK programming language
AWK is a programming language specifically handy in text processing. Most of the notes are from "The AWK Programming Language". ([Link](https://hackmd.io/@DBUyNCQ1Q1S3ECugt2X6HQ/HJqLz_L-O))

# Deep learning and Machine learning
I will record the papers I read here, and write a summary for each one of them [here](https://hackmd.io/@DBUyNCQ1Q1S3ECugt2X6HQ/HyIt069pU).

I will focus on the following five directions:

1. The classic models and follow-up studies,
2. The reinforcement learning and active learning,
2. The application on the biomedical research,
3. The application on the stock market,
4. The state-of-the-art models that even your grandma knows.
