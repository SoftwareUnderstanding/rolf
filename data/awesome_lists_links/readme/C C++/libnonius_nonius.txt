# Nonius

## What is nonius?

Nonius is an open-source framework for benchmarking small snippets of C++ code.
It is very heavily inspired by [Criterion], a similar Haskell-based tool. It
runs your code, measures the time it takes to run, and then performs some
statistical analysis on those measurements.

The library is header-only so you donâ€™t have to build it. It comes as a single
header that you can drop somewhere and #include it in your code. Grab that
header from the [releases] page.
