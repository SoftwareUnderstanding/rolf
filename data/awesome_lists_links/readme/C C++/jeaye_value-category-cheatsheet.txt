# C++14 value category cheatsheet

Herein lies a generated PDF which outlines the common pitfalls and edge cases
with C++14's lvalues, rvalues, and the like. The cheatsheet is generated by
running an HTTP server using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and
[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and then converting the produced
web page to a PDF using [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

This project accompanied a talk I presented, in hopes of conveying the
intricacies of everyday C++ work.

## Running locally
```bash
# Assuming leiningen is installed
$ lein ring server
```

## Some of these rules change in C++17, why not use them?
This cheatsheet is meant to be a practical reference for the everyday C++ dev
working in existing codebases. Since C++17 is not yet published, and codebases
are much more likely to be using the C++11 and C++14 rulesets, I've focused on
C++14.
