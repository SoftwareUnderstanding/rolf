## TimSort

A C++ implementation of TimSort, an O(n log n) stable sorting algorithm, ported from Python's and OpenJDK's.

See also the following links for a detailed description of TimSort:
* http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort

This library requires at least C++11. If you need a C++98 version, you can check the 1.x.y branch of this repository.

According to the benchmarks, `gfx::timsort` is slower than [`std::sort()`][std-sort] on randomized sequences, but
faster on partially-sorted ones. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for [`std::stable_sort`][std-stable-sort],
with the difference that it can't fallback to a O(n logÂ² n) algorithm when there isn't enough extra heap memory
available.

`gfx::timsort` also has a few additional features and guarantees compared to `std::stable_sort`:
* It can take a [projection function][projection] after the comparison function. The support is a bit rougher than in
  the linked article or the C++20 standard library: unless [`std::invoke`][std-invoke] is available, only instances of
  types callable with parentheses can be used, there is no support for pointer to members.
* It can be passed a range instead of a pair of iterators, in which case it will sort the whole range.
* This implementation of timsort notably avoids using the postfix `++` or `--` operators: only their prefix equivalents
  are used, which means that timsort will work even if the postfix operators are not present or return an incompatible
  type such as `void`.

Merging sorted ranges efficiently is an important part of the TimSort algorithm. This library exposes `gfx::timmerge`
in the public API, a drop-in replacement for [`std::inplace_merge`][std-inplace-merge] with the difference that it
can't fallback to a O(n log n) algorithm when there isn't enough extra heap memory available. According to the
benchmarks, `gfx::timmerge` is slower than `std::inplace_merge` on heavily/randomly overlapping subranges of simple
elements, but it is faster for complex elements such as `std::string` and on sparsely overlapping subranges.

Just like `gfx::timsort`, `gfx::timmerge` can take a projection function and avoids using the postfix `++` and `--`
operators.

The list of available signatures is as follows (in namespace `gfx`):

```cpp
// timsort

template <
    typename RandomAccessIterator,
    typename Compare = /* see below (1) */,
    typename Projection = /* see below (2) */
>
void timsort(RandomAccessIterator const first, RandomAccessIterator const last,
             Compare compare, Projection projection);

template <
    typename RandomAccessRange,
    typename Compare = /* see below (1) */,
    typename Projection = /* see below (2) */
>
void timsort(RandomAccessRange &range, Compare compare, Projection projection);

// timmerge

template <
    typename RandomAccessIterator,
    typename Compare = /* see below (1) */,
    typename Projection = /* see below (2) */
>
void timmerge(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator middle,
              RandomAccessIterator last, Compare compare, Projection projection);
```

In the signatures above:
- (1) [`std::less`][std-less] specialization for the `value_type` of the passed range or iterator.
- (2) Custom class equivalent to [`std::identity`][std-identity].

## EXAMPLE

Example of using timsort with a comparison function and a projection function to sort a vector of strings by length:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <gfx/timsort.hpp>

size_t len(const std::string& str) {
    return str.size();
}

// Sort a vector of strings by length
std::vector<std::string> collection = { /* ... */ };
gfx::timsort(collection, std::less<std::string>{}, &len);
```

## INSTALLATION & COMPATIBILITY

![Ubuntu builds status](https://github.com/timsort/cpp-TimSort/workflows/Ubuntu%20Builds/badge.svg?branch=master)
![Windows builds status](https://github.com/timsort/cpp-TimSort/workflows/Windows%20Builds/badge.svg?branch=master)
![MacOS builds status](https://github.com/timsort/cpp-TimSort/workflows/MacOS%20Builds/badge.svg?branch=master)

The library has been tested with the following compilers:
* GCC 5.5
* Clang 6
* MSVC 2017

It should also work with more recent compilers, and most likely with some older compilers too. We used to guarantee
support as far back as Clang 3.8, but the new continuous integration environment doesn't go that far back.

The library can be installed on the system via CMake with the following commands:

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build
make install
```

Alternatively the library is also available on conan-center-index and can be installed in your local Conan cache via
the following command:

```sh
conan install timsort/2.1.0
```

## DIAGNOSTICS & INFORMATION

The following configuration macros allow `gfx::timsort` and `gfx::timmerge` to emit diagnostics, which can be helpful
to diagnose issues:
* Defining `GFX_TIMSORT_ENABLE_ASSERT` inserts assertions in key locations in the algorithm to avoid logic errors.
* Defining `GFX_TIMSORT_ENABLE_AUDIT` inserts assertions that verify pre- and postconditions. These verifications can
  slow the algorithm down significantly. Enable the audits only while testing or debugging.
* Defining `GFX_TIMSORT_ENABLE_LOG` inserts logs in key locations, which allow to follow more closely the flow of the
  algorithm.

**cpp-TimSort** follows semantic versioning and provides the following macros to retrieve the current major, minor
and patch versions:

```cpp
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_MAJOR
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_MINOR
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_PATCH
```

## TESTS

The tests are written with Catch2 and can be compiled with CMake and run through CTest.

When using the project's main `CMakeLists.txt`, the CMake variable `BUILD_TESTING` is `ON` by default unless the
project is included as a subdirectory. The following CMake variables are available to change the way the tests are
built with CMake:
* `GFX_TIMSORT_USE_VALGRIND`: if `ON`, the tests will be run through Valgrind (`OFF` by default)
* `GFX_TIMSORT_SANITIZE`: this variable takes a comma-separated list of sanitizers options to run the tests (empty by default)

## BENCHMARKS

Benchmarks are available in the `benchmarks` subdirectory, and can be constructed directly by passing `BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON`
variable to CMake during the configuration step.
