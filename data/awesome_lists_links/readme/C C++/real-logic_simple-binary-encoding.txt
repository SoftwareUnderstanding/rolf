[SBE](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding) is an OSI layer 6 presentation for 
encoding and decoding binary application messages for low-latency financial applications. This repository contains 
the reference implementations in Java, C++, Golang, C#, and Rust.

More details on the design and usage of SBE can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki).

An XSD for SBE specs can be found
[here](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/sbe-tool/src/main/resources/fpl/sbe.xsd). Please address questions about the specification to the [SBE FIX community](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding).

For the latest version information and changes see the [Change Log](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Change-Log) with **downloads** at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Csbe). 

The Java and C++ SBE implementations work very efficiently with the [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron)
messaging system for low-latency and high-throughput communications. The Java SBE implementation has a dependency on
[Agrona](https://github.com/real-logic/agrona) for its buffer implementations. Commercial support is available from
[sales@real-logic.co.uk](mailto:sales@real-logic.co.uk?subject=SBE).

Binaries
--------
Binaries and dependency information for Maven, Ivy, Gradle, and others can be found at 
[http://search.maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Csbe).

Example for Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.co.real-logic</groupId>
    <artifactId>sbe-all</artifactId>
    <version>${sbe.tool.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Build
-----

Build the project with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) using this [build.gradle](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/build.gradle) file.

Full clean build:

    $ ./gradlew

Run the Java examples

    $ ./gradlew runJavaExamples

Distribution
------------
Jars for the executable, source, and javadoc for the various modules can be found in the following directories:

    sbe-benchmarks/build/libs
    sbe-samples/build/libs
    sbe-tool/build/libs
    sbe-all/build/libs

An example to execute a Jar from command line using the 'all' jar which includes the Agrona dependency:

    java -Dsbe.generate.ir=true -Dsbe.target.language=Cpp -Dsbe.target.namespace=sbe -Dsbe.output.dir=include/gen -Dsbe.errorLog=yes -jar sbe-all/build/libs/sbe-all-${SBE_TOOL_VERSION}.jar my-sbe-messages.xml

C++ Build using CMake
---------------------
NOTE: Linux, Mac OS, and Windows only for the moment. See
[FAQ](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).
Windows builds have been tested with Visual Studio Express 12.

For convenience, the `cppbuild` script does a full clean, build, and test of all targets as a Release build.

    $ ./cppbuild/cppbuild

If you are comfortable using CMake, then a full clean, build, and test looks like:

    $ mkdir -p cppbuild/Debug
    $ cd cppbuild/Debug
    $ cmake ../..
    $ cmake --build . --clean-first
    $ ctest

__Note__: The C++ build includes the C generator. Currently, the C generator is a work in progress.

Golang Build
------------

First build using Gradle to generate the SBE jar and then use it to generate the golang code for testing.

    $ ./gradlew
    $ ./gradlew generateGolangCodecs

For convenience on Linux, a gnu Makefile is provided that runs some tests and contains some examples.

    $ cd gocode
    # make # test, examples, bench

Users of golang generated code should see the [user
documentation](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Golang-User-Guide).

Developers wishing to enhance the golang generator should see the [developer
documentation](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/gocode/README.md)

C# Build
--------
Users of CSharp generated code should see the [user documentation](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/wiki/Csharp-User-Guide).

Developers wishing to enhance the CSharp generator should see the [developer documentation](https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding/blob/master/csharp/README.md)

Rust Build
------------
The SBE Rust generator will produce 100% safe rust crates (no `unsafe` code will be generated).  Generated crates do
not have any dependencies on any libraries (including no SBE libraries). If you don't yet have Rust installed 
see [Rust: Getting Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

Generate the Rust codecs

    $ ./gradlew generateRustCodecs

Run the Rust test from Gradle

    $ ./gradlew runRustTests

Or run test directly with `Cargo`

    $ cd rust
    $ cargo test
