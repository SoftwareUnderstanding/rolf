# Synopsis

![MPQC Logo](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/mpqc/wiki/images/mpqc_logo_med.png)

The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC) platform is a research package for *ab initio* simulation of the electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids.
The current (4th) version of the package, sometimes referred to as __MPQC4__, is a modern reenvisioning of the conceptual design of the original MPQC platform using the massively-parallel tensor framework [TiledArray](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray), distributed task-based programming model and runtime [MADWorld](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness), and the Gaussian integrals library [Libint](https://github.com/evaleev/libint).

# Developers

# Performance

Excellent strong scaling performance of the electronic structure methods in MPQC is demonstrated below for the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wave function solver. Parallel speed-up of 1 iteration of CCSD solver for uracil trimer in 6-31G* AO basis was measured on ["BlueRidge" cluster](https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/computing/blueridge-sandy-bridge/) at Virginia Tech (wall time on 1 16-core node = 1290 sec):
