# PF_RING™

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ntop/PF_RING.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ntop/PF_RING)


### Introduction

PF_RING™ is a Linux kernel module and user-space framework that allows you to process packets at high-rates while providing you a consistent API for packet processing applications.

### Who needs PF_RING™?
Basically everyone who has to handle many packets per second. The term ‘many’ changes according to the hardware you use for traffic analysis. It can range from 80k pkt/sec on a 1,2GHz ARM to more than 20M pkt/sec **per core** on a low-end 2,5GHz Xeon. PF_RING™ not only enables you to capture packets faster, it also captures packets more efficiently preserving CPU cycles.
