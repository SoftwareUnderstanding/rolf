# YOMM2

This is a complete rewrite of YOMM11, which is now deprecated. This library is
much better, see [here](yomm11-yomm2.md) to find out why.

## TL;DR

If you are familiar with the concept of open multi-methods, or prefer to learn
by reading code, go directly to [the synopsis](examples/synopsis.cpp)

## Open Methods in a Nutshell

### Cross-cutting Concerns and the Expression Problem

You have a matrix math library. It deals with all sort of matrices: dense,
diagonal, tri-diagonal, etc. Each matrix subtype has a corresponding class in a
hierarchy rooted in Matrix.

Now you would like to render Matrix objects as JSON strings. The representation
will vary depending on the exact type of the object; for example, if a matrix
is a DiagonalMatrix, you only need to store the diagonal - the other elements
are all zeroes.

This is an example of a ["cross-cutting
concern"](http://wiki.c2.com/?CrossCuttingConcern). How do you do it?

It turns out that OOP doesn't offer a good solution to this.

You can stick a pure virtual `to_json` function in the `Matrix` base class and
override it in the subclasses. It is an easy solution but it has severe
drawbacks. It requires you to change the Matrix class and its subclasses, and
recompile the library. And now all the applications that use it will contain
the `to_json` functions even if they don't need them, because of the way
virtual functions are implemented.

Or you may resort on a "type switch": have the application test for each
category and generate the JSON accordingly. This is tedious, error prone and,
above all, not extensible. Adding a new matrix subclass requires updating all
the type switches. The Visitor pattern also suffers from this flaw.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could add behavior to existing types, just as easily
and unintrusively as you can extend existing class hierarchies via derivation?
What if you could solve the so-called [Expression
Problem](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExpressionProblem):

```
behaviors += types
types += behaviors
```

This is exactly what Open Methods are all about: solving the Expression
Problem.

Let's look at an example.

```c++
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// library code

struct matrix {
    virtual ~matrix() {}
    // ...
};

struct dense_matrix    : matrix { /* ... */ };
struct diagonal_matrix : matrix { /* ... */ };

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// application code

#include <yorel/yomm2/cute.hpp>

using yorel::yomm2::virtual_;

register_class(matrix);
register_class(dense_matrix, matrix);
register_class(diagonal_matrix, matrix);

declare_method(string, to_json, (virtual_<const matrix&>));

define_method(string, to_json, (const dense_matrix& m)) {
    return "json for dense matrix...";
}

define_method(string, to_json, (const diagonal_matrix& m)) {
    return "json for diagonal matrix...";
}

int main() {
    yorel::yomm2::update_methods();

    shared_ptr<const matrix> a = make_shared<dense_matrix>();
    shared_ptr<const matrix> b = make_shared<diagonal_matrix>();

    cout << to_json(*a) << "\n"; // json for dense matrix
    cout << to_json(*b) << "\n"; // json for diagonal matrix

    return 0;
}
```

The `declare_method` line declares an open method called `to_json`that takes
one virtual argument of type `const matrix&` and returns a string. The
`virtual_<>` decorator specifies that the argument must be taken into account
to select the appropriate specialization. In essence, this is the same thing as
having a `virtual string to_json() const` inside class Matrix - except
that the virtual function lives outside of any classes, and you can add as many
as you want without modifying the classes.

NOTE: DO NOT specify argument names, i.e. `virtual_<const matrix&> arg` is not
permitted.

The following two `define_method` blocks define two
implementations for the `to_json` method: one for dense matrices, and one for
diagonal matrices.

`yorel::yomm2::update_methods()` must be called before any method is called,
and after dynamically loading and unloading shared libraries.

### Multiple Dispatch

Methods can have more than one virtual argument. This is handy in certain
situations, for example to implement binary operations on matrices:

```c++

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// matrix * matrix

declare_method(
    shared_ptr<const matrix>,
    times,
    (virtual_<shared_ptr<const matrix>>, virtual_<shared_ptr<const matrix>>));

// catch-all matrix * matrix -> dense_matrix
define_method(
    shared_ptr<const matrix>,
    times,
    (shared_ptr<const matrix> a, shared_ptr<const matrix> b)) {
    return make_shared<dense_matrix>();
}

// diagonal_matrix * diagonal_matrix -> diagonal_matrix
define_method(
    shared_ptr<const matrix>,
    times,
    (shared_ptr<const diagonal_matrix> a, shared_ptr<const diagonal_matrix> b)) {
    return make_shared<diagonal_matrix>();
}
```

## Performance

Don't worry about it. Open methods are almost as fast as ordinary virtual
member functions once you turn on optimization (-O2). With both clang and gcc,
dispatching a call to a method with one virtual argument is only 15-30% slower
than calling the equivalent virtual member function. If the body of the method
does any amount of work, the difference is unnoticeable. See the implementation
notes for benchmarks and assembly listings.

## Building and Installing

Make sure that you have the following dependencies:

* a C++17 capable compiler

* cmake version 3.5 or above

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jll63/yomm2.git
cd yomm2
```

Create a build directory and run cmake then make:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you want to run the tests:

```
cmake .. -DYOMM2_ENABLE_TESTS=1
make && ctest
```

YOMM2 uses several Boost libraries:

1. Preprocessor, DynamicBitset, TypeTraits: included by YOMM2 headers

2. Boost.Test: only used to run the test suite

If these libraries are already available on your machine, and they can be found
by `cmake`, they will be used. In this case, make sure that the pre-installed
libraries are at version 1.65 or above. If Boost is not found, the latest
version will be downloaded, and the Boost headers mentioned in section (1) will
be installed along YOMM2 (if you decide to `make install`).

If you also want to run the benchmarks (and in this case you really want a
release build):

```
cmake .. -DYOMM2_ENABLE_TESTS=1 -DYOMM2_ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make && tests/benchmarks # wow it's fast!
```
This will automatically download the dependency
[benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark), build it and finally install
it to `./extern` within the root directory of yomm2.

Finally, if you like it and you want to install it:

```
# either:
sudo make install
# or:
make install DESTDIR=/path/to/my/libs
```
This will install the library and headers, as well as a CMake package
configuration.

Make sure to add the install location to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` so that you can use
`find_package(YOMM2)` from your including project. For linking, the use
`target_link_library(<your_target> YOMM2::yomm2)`. This will automatically add
the necessary include directories, so this should be all you need to do to link
to yomm2.
