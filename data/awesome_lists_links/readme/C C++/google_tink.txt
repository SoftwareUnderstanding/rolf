## Introduction

Using crypto in your application [shouldn't have to][devs_are_users_too_slides]
feel like juggling chainsaws in the dark. Tink is a crypto library written by a
group of cryptographers and security engineers at Google. It was born out of our
extensive experience working with Google's product teams, [fixing weaknesses in
implementations](https://github.com/google/wycheproof), and providing simple
APIs that can be used safely without needing a crypto background.

Tink provides secure APIs that are easy to use correctly and hard(er) to misuse.
It reduces common crypto pitfalls with user-centered design, careful
implementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. At Google, Tink is one
of the standard crypto libraries, and has been deployed in hundreds of products
and systems.

To get a quick overview of Tink design please take a look at
[slides][tink_talk_slides] from [a talk about Tink][tink_talk_recording]
presented at [Real World Crypto 2019](https://rwc.iacr.org/2019/).

## Current status

[Java/Android](docs/JAVA-HOWTO.md), [C++](docs/CPP-HOWTO.md),
[Obj-C](docs/OBJC-HOWTO.md), [Go](docs/GOLANG-HOWTO.md), and
[Python](docs/PYTHON-HOWTO.md) are field tested and ready for production. The
latest version is [1.6.1](https://github.com/google/tink/releases/tag/v1.6.1),
released on 2021-07-12.

Javascript/Typescript is in an alpha state and should only be used for testing.

## Getting started

Documentation for the project is located at https://developers.google.com/tink.
Currently, it details a variety of common usage scenarios and covers the Java
and Python implementations. The site will be populated with more content over
time.

Alternatively, you can look at all of the [`examples`] which demonstrate
performing simple tasks using Tink in a variety of languages.

## Community-driven ports

Out of the box Tink supports a wide range of languages, but it still doesn't
support every language. Fortunately, some users like Tink so much that they've
ported it to their favorite languages! Below you can find notable ports.

**WARNING** While we usually review these ports, until further notice, we do not
maintain them and have no plan to support them in the foreseeable future.
