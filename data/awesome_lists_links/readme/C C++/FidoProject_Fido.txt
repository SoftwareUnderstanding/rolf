Fido is an lightweight, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido is especially suited for robotic and embedded contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.

Check out the [project site](http://fidoproject.github.io/) and [documentation](http://fidoproject.github.io/docs/html/) for more information.

The library was adapted from [a universal robot control system](https://github.com/FidoProject/Research).

## Authors

The Fido library was primarily developed by [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20). [Joshua Gruenstein](https://github.com/joshuagruenstein) helped develop Fido's robotic simulator. Most of his commits are to the schematics and paper of [a decoupled research study](https://github.com/FidoProject/Research) that he and Michael performed together.

## Beta Status

This library is in **beta**. It has been used in a couple of projects, but the API may still change in backward-incompatible ways. There are definetly bugs.
