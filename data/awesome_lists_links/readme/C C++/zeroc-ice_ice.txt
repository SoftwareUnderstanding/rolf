# Ice - Comprehensive RPC Framework

Ice helps you network your software with minimal effort. By taking care of all
interactions with low-level network programming interfaces, Ice allows you to focus
your efforts on your application logic. When using Ice, there is no need to worry
about details such as opening network connections, serializing and deserializing
data for network transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts (to name just
a few of dozens of such low-level details).

You can download Ice releases from [ZeroC's website](https://zeroc.com/downloads/ice).
Use this GitHub repository to build from source; see [branches](#branches) for more
information.
