# WAFer

WAFer is a C language-based ultra-light scalable server-side web applications framework. Think node.js for C programmers. Because it's written in C for the C eco system, WAFer is wafer-thins with a memory footprint that is only a fraction of that of node.js and other bulky frameworks.

Just copy server.c (say, as myserver.c), put your code inside the function `void server(Request request)` in `myserver.c` and, make with `make SERVER=myserver`, and you are good to go.

WAFer can operate in many different configurations, all selected at compile time. They include:


1. Single-threaded (Default) or multi-threaded (make with `THREADS=n` where n>0)

2. Select(Default) or epoll (make with `LOOP=epoll`) based event loop

3. C10K mode (make with `LOOP=epoll MAX_CON_CONS=n` where n>10,000)


Default port is 4242. Set environment variable 'PORT' to change it.

That's really it. The source comes with a simple example `example.c` to get you started.
