## overview

The [Variant Call Format
(VCF)](http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)
is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format that
describes reference-indexed variations between individuals.  VCF
provides a common interchange format for the description of variation
in individuals and populations of samples, and has become the
*de facto* standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic
variant detectors.

vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation
described by VCF.  It is both:

 * an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation as
   it can be described by the VCF format
 * a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex
   manipulations on VCF files

vclib is both a library (with an API) and a collection of useful
tools. The API provides a quick and extremely permissive method to
read and write VCF files.  Extensions and applications of the library
provided in the included utilities (*.cpp) comprise the vast bulk of
the library's utility.

## USAGE

Users are encouraged to drive the utilities in the library in a
streaming fashion, using Unix pipes to fully utilize resources on
multi-core systems.  Piping provides a convenient method to interface
with other libraries (vcf-tools, BedTools, GATK, htslib,
[bio-vcf](https://github.com/vcflib/bio-vcf), bcftools,
[freebayes](https://github.com/freebayes)) which interface via VCF
files, allowing the composition of an immense variety of processing
functions. Examples can be found in the scripts,
e.g. [script](./scripts/vcfgtcompare.sh).

# Development

## build from source

VCFLIB uses the cmake build system, after a recursive checkout
of the sources make the files in the ./build directory with:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib.git
cd vcflib
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOPENMP=OFF ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
```

and to run the tests

```sh
ctest --verbose
```

Executables are built into the `./build` directory in the repository.

Note, if you have an existing repo update submodules with

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
cd build
cmake --build . --target clean
```

Build dependencies can be viewed in the Travis-CI and github-CI
scripts (see badges above), as well as [guix.scm](./guix.scm) used by
us to create the build environment (for instructions see the header of
guix.scm). Essentially:

- C++ compiler
- htslib
- tabixpp

For include files add

- libhts-dev
- libtabixpp-dev
- libtabixpp0

And for some of the VCF executables

- python
- perl

### Using a different htslib

Check out htslib in tabixpp (recursively) and

    cmake -DHTSLIB_LOCAL:STRING=./tabixpp/htslib/ ..
    cmake --build .

## link library

The standard build creates `build/vcflib.a`. Take a hint from the
[cmake](./CMakeLists.txt) file that builds all the vcflib tools.

## source code

See [vcfecho.cpp](./src/vcfecho.cpp) for basic usage.
[Variant.h](./src/Variant.h) and [Variant.cpp](./src/Variant.cpp)
describe methods available in the API.  vcflib is incorporated into
several projects, such as
[freebayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes), which may provide
a point of reference for prospective developers.  Note vcflib contains
submodules (git repositories) comprising some dependencies. A full
Guix development environment we use is defined [here](./guix.scm).

# adding tests

vcflib uses different test systems. The most important one is the
[doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) because it
doubles as documentation. For an example see
[vcf2tsv.md](./test/pytest/vcf2tsv.md) which can be run from the
command line with

```sh
cd test
python3 -m doctest -o NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE -o REPORT_UDIFF pytest/vcf2tsv.md
```

# Contributing

To contribute code to vcflib send a github pull request. We may ask
you to add a working test case as described in 'adding tests'.
