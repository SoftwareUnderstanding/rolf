[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivansafrin/Polycode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivansafrin/Polycode)

Polycode is a cross-platform framework for creative code. You can use it as a C++ API or as a standalone scripting language to get easy and simple access to accelerated 2D and 3D graphics, hardware shaders, sound and network programming, physics engines and more.

The core Polycode API is written in C++ and can be used to create portable native applications.

On top of the core C++ API, Polycode offers a Lua-based scripting system with its own set of compilation tools. The Lua API mirrors the C++ API and can be used to easily create prototypes and even publish complete applications to multiple platforms without compiling C++.

Polycode is available under the MIT license and was designed and developed by Ivan Safrin.

Please see BUILD.md for instructions on how to build Polycode from source.
