## Introduction

Elements is a lightweight, fine-grained, resolution independent, modular GUI library. 
Elements is designed with these requirements in mind:

1. It should be open source with a liberal, non-viral license.
2. It should be usable in any application and should play well with other GUI
   libraries and frameworks.
3. Corollary to the second requirement is that it can also be used to develop
   plugins. It should not own the event loop and should be able to co-exist
   with components within a plugin host such as VST and AU.
4. It should be resolution independent and allow for HDPI displays.
5. Should not rely on a “visual” GUI editor or code generator.
6. It should have a declarative API using modern C++. Declarative C++ code
   tells you *what* rather than *how* (imperative). The GUI should be
   declared in C++ code.
7. Keep it simple. Make it easy to use right out of the box, with a lot of examples.
8. Porting to a new host target should be as easy as possible, requiring 
   porting of only a few files.

Elements, is extremely lightweight… and modular. You compose very
fine-grained, flyweight “elements” to form deep element hierarchies using a
declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse.

## Status

Please take note that Elements is still very much in flux as we are inching
closer towards a version 1.0 release. The API and code is still undergoing
continuous changes, and for that matter, Elements is not yet "production
ready". But that should not prevent you from using Elements now! It is
already in a very usable form, and more people using it will ultimately make
it more robust when bugs are reported and fixed. API and usability matters
and I very much welcome suggestions and contributions. Hey, this is an open
source project! If you like the design, concepts and ideas behind Elements, I
very much welcome collaboration.
