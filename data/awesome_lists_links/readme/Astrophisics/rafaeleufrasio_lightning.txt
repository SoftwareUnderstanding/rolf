# Lightning SED Fitting Package #

#### Introduction ####
Lightning is a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting procedure that quickly and reliably recovers star formation history (SFH) and extinction parameters. The SFH is modeled as discrete steps in time. The Version 1 (v1) code consists of a fully vectorized inversion algorithm used to determine SFH step intensities and combines this with a grid-based approach to determine three attenuation parameters. The Version 2 (v2) code consists of an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm used to determine SFH step intensities, attenuation parameters, and dust emission parameters. Version 2 adds the dust emission models from Draine & Li (2007) to model NIR to FIR emission, and the inclination-dependent attenuation curves from Tuffs et al. (2004) as updated by Popescu et al. (2011).

> **NOTE:** We are currently working on compiling the fitting methods (and adding more) to one streamlined package and writing thorough documentation to be easy to use for new users. This basic documentation is for the most recent version of Lightning that uses the MCMC algorithm (v2). However, the package contains both versions.

#### Installation ####

To install the Lightning package, enter the following:

```
cd <install_dir>
git clone https://github.com/rafaeleufrasio/lightning
```

> **NOTE:** Lightning is written in IDL and requires the IDL Astronomy User's Library (https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov).

#### Post-Installation, Pre-Usage IDL Set-Up ####

Before running Lightning v2, the Lightning package must be added to you IDL path. This can be done
permanently within an IDL session so that it does not have to be added each session with:

```
PREF_SET, 'IDL_PATH', PREF_GET('IDL_PATH')+':+/PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/lightning', /COMMIT
```

where `/PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/` is the path to the lightning directory, or only for
the current session with:

```
!PATH = EXPAND_PATH(PREF_GET('IDL_PATH')+':+/PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/lightning')
```

Then the lightning startup file must be run:

```
@ startup_lightning.pro
```
To simplify this process, this line CAN be added to the users `IDL_STARTUP` file. If one does not have a startup file, startup_lightning.pro can be made the startup file and added to the users preferences with:

```
PREF_SET, 'IDL_STARTUP', /PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/startup_lightning.pro, /commit
```

Lightning v2 must then be compiled before running using:

```
.r dl07_spec_vector.pro
.r lightning_MCMC.pro
```

```


##### Required Inputs #####
- `LNU_OBS` - The observed photometry to be fit as L_nu with units of L_sun Hz^-1. This requires the observed flux to be converted to luminosity.
- `LNU_UNC` - The observed photometry's uncertainty as Lnu with units of L_sun Hz^-1
- `LTIR_OBS` - The observed total infrared luminosity. With the usage of the dust model, this should be set to 0.d0
- `LTIR_UNC` - The uncertainty on the total infrared luminosity. With the usage of the dust model, this MUST be set to 0.d0
- `GALAXY_ID` - The ID string label for the SED being fit (e.g., 'NGC224' or 'J004244.30+411609.00')
- `FILTER_LABELS` - The string labels for the filters corresponding to the observed photometry (`LNU_OBS`) in the same order. Filters' transmission functions must be stored within the Filters subdirectory of the Lightning package. The labels used MUST match those found listed in the case statement of `get_filters.pro`. If the filter is not in the case statement of `get_filters.pro`, then the name of the filter must be added to the procedure and the transmission function must be added to the Filters subdirectory following the layout of all other filter transmission functions.

##### Optional Inputs #####

###### Universal Optional Inputs ######

- `Z_SHIFT` - Redshift of SED (default is `0.0`).
- `STEPS_BOUNDS` - Vector giving the boundaries of the age bins in years (default is `[0.d0,1.d7,1.d8,1.d9,5.d9,13.6d9]`).
- `NPARALLEL` - Number of chains to run in one call of Lightning. This will only fit the input SED multiple times, not multiple SEDs at once. Mainly used to check for convergence of the MCMC chain (default is 1, which means the SED is fit once).
- `NTRIALS` - Number of iterations to create the MCMC chain (default is 1e5).
- `OUTFOLDER` - String containing the directory for the output files (default is `'~/MCMC_Lightning_runs/'`).
- `LIGHTNING_FOLDER` - String containing the path to and including the installed Lightning package. (i.e., `'/PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/lightning/'`; default is `'~/lightning/'`).
- `ZMET` - Metallicity of to fit the SED in terms of Z. Currently available metallicites are 0.001, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 (default is Z_solar = 0.02).
- `IMF` - String containing the IMF to fit the SED. Currently available IMFs are Kroupa (2001) (default is Kroupa 2001).
- `COEFF_START` - Vector of length `n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1` containing the starting MCMC values for the SFH coefficients. If `NPARALLEL > 1`, then  `COEFF_START` can be an array with dimensions `[n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1, NPARALLEL]`, or it can remain a vector, then each parallel chain will have the same starting point (default is a vector of all 1.0's).
- `COEFF_SIGMA` - Vector of length `n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS)-1` containing the starting standard deviations to use for the SFH coefficients in the proposal covariance matrix. If `NPARALLEL > 1`, then `COEFF_SIGMA` can be an array with dimensions `[n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1, NPARALLEL]`, or it can remain a vector, then each parallel chain will have the same starting covariance matrix (default is a vector of all 1.0's). We recommend NOT using this optional input if using the Adaptive MCMC algorithm.
- `PARAMETER_START`  - A 10 element vector containing the starting attenuation and dust emission parameters. If `NPARALLEL > 1`, then `PARAMETER_START` can be an array with dimensions `[10, NPARALLEL]`, or it can remain a vector, then each parallel chain will have the same starting parameters. The first 5 elements of the vector are the dust attenuation parameters, and the final 5 are the dust emission parameters.
    - If the Calzetti or modified Calzetti curve is used, then the first parameter is the diffuse V-band optical depth (`tauV_diff`, range:`[0.d0,3.d0]`), the second is the variable slope (`delta`, range:`[-2.3d,0.4d]`), the third is the birth cloud optical depth in the V-band (`tauV_BC`, range:`[0.0d,4.0d]`), and the final two attenuation parameters are void and can be any value (preferably 0.0).
    - If the Tuffs attenuation curves are used, then the first parameter is the face-on B-band optical depth (`taub_f`, range:`[0.d0,8.d0]`), the second is the fraction of intrinsic flux density from the old stellar components compared to the total intrinsic flux density (`rold0`, range:`[0.0d,1.0d]`), the third is the birth cloud clumpiness factor (`F`, range:`[0.0d,0.61d]`), the fourth is the inclination in terms of cos(i) (`cosi`, range:`[0.0d,1.0d]`), and the fifth is the bulge-to-disk ratio (`b_to_d`, range:`[0.0d,!values.d_infinity]`).
    - If the dust emission is used, then the sixth parameter (i.e., the first dust emission parameter) is the slope of the power law (`alpha`, range:`[-10.d0,4d0]`), the seventh is the minimum radiation field intensity (`Umin`, range:`[0.1d0,25]`), the eighth is the maximum radiation field intensity (`Umax`, range:`[1.d3,3.d5]`), the ninth is the fraction of dust mass exposed to the power-law radiation field (`gamma`, range:`[0.0d,1.0d]`), and the tenth is the PAH index (`qPAH`, range:`[0.0047d,0.0458d]`).
    - The default parameter vector is `[0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0, 0, -2.d0, 1.0, 1.d4, 0.1, 0.020]` if using the Calzetti curve and `[1.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, -2.d0, 1.0, 1.d4, 0.1, 0.020]` if using the Tuffs model.
- `PARAMETER_SIGMA`  - A 10 element vector containing the starting standard deviations to use for the attenuation and dust emission parameters in the proposal covariance matrix. `If NPARALLEL > 1`, then `PARAMETER_START` can be an array with dimensions `[10,NPARALLEL]`, or it can remain a vector, then each parallel chain will have the same starting parameters. The first 5 elements of the vector are the dust attenuation parameters, and the final 5 are the dust emission parameters. The default parameter deviation vector is `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0, 0, 0.5d0, 0.1, 1.d4, 0.1, 0.005]` if using the Calzetti curve and `[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5d0, 0.1, 1.d4, 0.1, 0.005]` for the Tuffs model. We recommend NOT using this optional input if using the Adaptive MCMC algorithm.

###### Adaptive MCMC Optional Inputs ######

> **NOTE:** `ADAPTIVE` keyword must be set for these to be used)

- `BETA_EXPONENT` - Value which dictates how fast the adaptive MCMC stops adapting. Larger values decrease the adaptiveness (i.e., stop adapting sooner), smaller values increase the adaptiveness (i.e., adapt for longer). Must be between 0 and 1 (default is 0.35).

###### Tuffs Attenuation Optional Inputs #####  

> **NOTE:** `TUFFS_ATTENUATION` keyword must be set for these to be used)

- `PRIOR_DIST` - Structure giving the tabulated prior distribution and corresponding bins from which to interpolate a prior. Current version of Lightning only supports a prior on inclination. `PRIOR_DIST` must have the following tags: `inc_pdf` and `inc_bins`, which are the probability of the inclination (`inc_pdf`) at the corresponding inclination (`inc_bins`). `USE_PRIOR` keyword must be set to use prior (default assumes a flat prior).
- `L_STAR_ABS_TABLE` - Structure giving the pre-computed table of `L_STAR_ABS` for a given redshift to have energy conservation with the Tuffs attenuation curves. Not required as Lightning will automatically read the table if the keyword `L_STAR_ABS_MODEL_TABLE` is set and the default `STEPS_BOUNDS` is used. However, pre-reading the table and inputting it will vastly increase speed of the code as Lightning re-reads the table for each MCMC iteration. This will be remedied in the next version. The structure for default `STEPS_BOUNDS` can be found in `./lightning/L_star_abs_model_table/`.
- `ROLD0_AGES` - Vector of length `n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS)-1` containing the values of the binary parameter `rold0`, designating each SFH bin as part of the young or old population. A value of 0 for the corresponding age bin considers it to be part of the young population, and a value of 1 for the corresponding age bin considers it to be part of the young populations. `ROLD0_AGES` elements corresponding to SFH bin ages <500 Myr should be set to 0, as stellar models with ages 􏰁<500 Myr can significantly
contribute to the unattenuated UV emission (See Doore et al. 2021 for more details).

##### Optional Keywords #####

###### Universal Keywords ######

- `PRINT_TIME` - If set, then Lightning will print the time taken to fit the SED.
- `NOLINES` - If set, then no emission lines will be included in the stellar models.  
- `NONEBULAR` - If set, then no nebular emission will be included in the stellar models.
- `PAR1_CONSTANT` - If set, then parameter 1 (`tauV_diff` for Calzetti model, `taub_f` for Tuffs model) will be held constant.      
- `PAR2_CONSTANT` - If set, then parameter 2 (`delta` for Calzetti models, `rold0` for Tuffs model) will be held constant.

- `PAR7_CONSTANT`  - If set, then parameter 7 (`Umin` for dust model) will be held constant.     
- `PAR8_CONSTANT`  - If set, then parameter 8 (`Umax` for dust model) will be held constant.      
- `PAR9_CONSTANT`  - If set, then parameter 9 (`gamma` for dust model) will be held constant.      
- `PAR10_CONSTANT` - If set, then parameter 10 (`qPAH` for dust model) will be held constant.

###### Dust Emission Keywords ######

- `DUST_EMISSION`  - If set, then the Draine & Li (2007) dust model will be used to fit the NIR to FIR emission.
    > **NOTE**: This is a REQUIRED keyword in this version of Lightning, without setting it, the code will fail!

###### Adaptive MCMC Keywords ######

- `ADAPTIVE`  - If set, then the MCMC algorithm will be adaptive, automatically finding the best proposal multivariate distribution to optimize the acceptance rate.

###### Calzetti Attenuation Keywords ######

- `CALZETTI_ATTENUATION` - If set, then the attenuation curve will be a pure Calzetti law. If this or `TUFFS_ATTENUATION` are not set, then the attenuation curve will be the modified Calzetti curve as described in Noll et al. (2009).

###### Tuffs Attenuation Keywords ######     

- `TUFFS_ATTENUATION` - If set, then the attenuation cuve will be the inclination-dependent Tuffs attenuation curves. If this or `CALZETTI_ATTENUATION` are not set, then the attenuation curve will be the modified Calzetti curve as described in Noll et al. (2009).    
- `USE_PRIORS` - If set, then a prior will be used on inclination. This must be set in conjunction with `PRIOR_DIST`.      
- `L_STAR_ABS_MODEL_TABLE` - if set, then energy balance will be determined from the pre-computed tables of `L_STAR_ABS_MODEL_TABLE`. If not set, then `L_STAR_ABS` will be calculated with each MCMC iteration, drastically increasing computational time.

##### Outputs #####

> **NOTE**: Output is a save file (.idl) in the OUTFOLDER directory with the name `GALAXY_ID + '_chain.idl'` containing the following variables.

- `CHAIN` - An array with dimensions of `[n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1 + 10, NTRIALS, NPARALLEL]`.
    - This is the resulting MCMC chain for each parameter and parallel chain. The first `n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1` in the first dimension are the SFH coefficients, the next five are the attenuation parameters, and the final five are the dust emission parameters.
- `CHI2_CHAIN` - An array with dimensions of `[NTRIALS, NPARALLEL]` giving the chisqr of the fit of the model to the data for each chain iteration and each parallel chain.
- `GALAXY_ID` - The ID of the galaxy (Ssme as input `GALAXY_ID`).
- `SIGMA_NEW` - Final covariance matrix.
- `LAMBDA_NEW` - Final factor to multiply the covariance matrix by.
- `MU_NEW` - Final average of the chain.
- `STEPS_MSTAR` - A `n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS) - 1` vector giving the factors needed to convert the SFH coefficients into stellar masses. To get a MCMC chain of masses for each time bin do the following:

```
steps_mstar_chain = chain[0:n_elements(STEPS_BOUNDS)-2, *, *]*$  
                    rebin(steps_mstar, 5, NTRIALS, NPARALLEL)
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the total mass, sum in the SFH coefficient dimension or:

```
mstar_chain = total(steps_mstar_chain, 1, /NAN)
```

- `STEPS_BOUNDS` - Vector giving the boundaries of the age bins in years. (Same as input `STEPS_BOUNDS`)
- `ACCEPTED_TRIALS` - Number of accepted MCMC trials.
- `CHI2_PRIOR_CHAIN` - An array with dimensions of `[NTRIALS,NPARALLEL]` giving the chisqr from the prior for each chain iteration and each parallel chain.

##### Notes #####
Lightning saves the output as the raw MCMC chain. To compute most parameters of interest, the chain will have to be input into the `MCMC_savefits_X.pro` file, where `X` is the attenuation curve used. We do not document this process here, but will document and streamline it in the upcoming version of Lightning.

#### Example ####
An example code for fitting the SED of galaxy J123548.94+621144.7 can be found in the Example subdirectory of the Lightning package.

To run the example, enter the following into the IDL command line after changing the current directory to the installation directory (`cd /PATH_TO_LIGHTNING_DIRECTORY/lightning/`):

```
@ ./Example/lightning_example.pro
```

This example results in an output file, which contains the fitting results to the SED of J123548.94+621144.7 using the Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve. A fits file for the parameters of interest have been computed. The fits file (`MCMC_lightning_calz.fits`) contain the final 5,000 iterations of the MCMC chain for various parameters of interest, such as the SFH, stellar mass, and AV; and the attenuation and dust emission parameters.
