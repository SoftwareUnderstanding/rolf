Torus
============

This is the Torus Code. It produces models for orbits in action-angle
coordinates in axisymmetric potentials. Look at the README file. Read
the paper. Try the executables. Look at the doxygen
documentation (start at index.html). Have fun!

N.B. This code requires ebf format for c++ installed:
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/ebfformat/files/libebf/c-cpp/)


Note that to use material described in Binney (2017) you will need to read the readme.txt in src/ and compile following those instructions.
