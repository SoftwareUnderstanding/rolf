# holosim-ml ðŸ“¡
```holosim-ml``` is a library for beam simulation and analysis of radio holography data from complex optical systems. This code uses machine learning to efficiently determine the position of hundreds of mirror adjusters on multiple mirrors with few micron accuracy. We apply this approach to the example of the Simons Observatory 6 m telescope.

For example, ```holosim-ml``` simulates the far-field beam pattern, with mirror surface error root-mean-squares of 0 Âµm, 20 Âµm, 35 Âµm, and 50 Âµm.  The side-lobes around the central beam increase as RMS of panel errors increases.  This figure was produced with the ```Window Function.ipynb``` notebook, at 150 GHz.

## Dependencies
* Python>=3.6
* numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/orgs/McMahonCosmologyGroup/holosim-ml
```

The notebooks call two .csv files with the telescope mirrors' panel geometries.  In order to run the notebooks, change the path in ```pan_mod.py``` to the location of the .csv files (lines 264 and 270). 
```
# Primary mirror adjuster positions
df_m1 = pd.read_csv(
    "path/to/folder/pans-adjs/Mirror-M1-vertical-adjuster-points_r1-1.csv",
    skiprows=2,
    na_values=["<-- ", "--> ", "<--", "-->"],
)
# Secondary mirror adjuster positions
df_m2 = pd.read_csv(
    "path/to/folder/pans-adjs/Mirror-M2-vertical-adjuster-points_r1-1.csv",
    skiprows=2,
    na_values=["<-- ", "--> ", "<--", "-->"],
)
```
