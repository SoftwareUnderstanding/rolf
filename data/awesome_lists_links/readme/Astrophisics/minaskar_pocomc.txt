# Getting started

## Brief introduction

``pocoMC`` utilises a *Normalising Flow* in order to precondition the target distribution by removing any correlations between its parameters. The code then generates posterior samples, that can be used for parameter estimation, using a powerful adaptive *Sequential Monte Carlo* algorithm manifesting a sampling effiency that can be orders of magnitude higher than without precondition. Furthermore, ``pocoMC`` also provides an unbiased estimate of the *model evidence* that can be used for the task of *Bayesian model comparison*.

## Documentation

Read the docs at [pocomc.readthedocs.io](https://pocomc.readthedocs.io) for more information, examples and tutorials.

## Installation

To install ``pocomc`` using ``pip`` run:

```bash
pip install pocomc
```

or, to install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minaskar/pocomc.git
cd pocomc
python setup.py install
```

## Basic example

For instance, if you wanted to draw samples from a 10-dimensional Rosenbrock distribution with a uniform prior, you would do something like:

```python
import pocomc as pc
import numpy as np

n_dim = 10  # Number of dimensions

def log_prior(x):
    if np.any((x < -10.0) | (x > 10.0)):  # If any dimension is out of bounds, the log prior is -infinity
        return -np.inf 
    else:
        return 0.0

def log_likelihood(x):
    return -np.sum(10.0*(x[:,::2]**2.0 - x[:,1::2])**2.0 \
            + (x[:,::2] - 1.0)**2.0, axis=1)


n_particles = 1000
prior_samples = np.random.uniform(size=(n_particles, n_dim), low=-10.0, high=10.0)

sampler = pc.Sampler(
    n_particles,
    n_dim,
    log_likelihood,
    log_prior,
    vectorize_likelihood=True,
    bounds=(-10.0, 10.0)
)
sampler.run(prior_samples)

results = sampler.results # Dictionary with results
```
