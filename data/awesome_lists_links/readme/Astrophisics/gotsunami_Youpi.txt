## About

Youpi stands for “YOUpi is your processing PIpeline”. It is a modern, 
easy to use yet powerful web application providing high level functionalities 
to perform data reduction on scientific FITS images. Built on top of various 
open source reduction tools released to the community by TERAPIX 
(http://terapix.iap.fr), Youpi can help organize your data, manage your 
processing jobs on a computer cluster in real time (using Condor) and 
facilitate teamwork by allowing fine-grain sharing of results and data.

Built from the ground up with modularity in mind, Youpi comes with plugins 
allowing to perform, from within a browser, various processing tasks such as 
evaluating the quality of incoming images (using the QualityFITS software 
package), computing astrometric and photometric solutions (using SCAMP), 
resampling and co-adding FITS images (using SWarp) and extracting sources 
and building source catalogues from astronomical images (using SExtractor).

Whether you are dealing with small to medium-sized data reduction projects, 
Youpi can be a powerful alternative to other pipeline data reduction software. 
Youpi is free software and published under the GNU General Public License.
