# vKompth

This is the Fortran version of the [vKompth](https://github.com/candebellavita/vkompth) code from [Bellavita et al. 2022, MNRAS in press](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13609) which was originally developed in [Karpouzas et al. 2020, MNRAS 492, 1399](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1399K/abstract) and [Garc√≠a et al. 2021, MNRAS 501, 3173](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3173G/abstract).


## Requirements

In order to invert the matrix of the linear problem, `vKompth` requires the `DGTSV`, `ZGETRF` and `ZGETRS` routines from the [Lapack](https://www.netlib.org/lapack) or [openBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) libraries, which have to be installed in your system. Before compiling the code check the `lopenblas` choice under the `LDFLAGS` variable in the `Makefile` and change it to `lopenblas`, `lopenblasp` or `llapack`, depending the one you have installed in your system.

Make sure you have [HEASOFT](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/) installed from the source version, and set it up before compiling the *XSPEC* models. This model has to be compiled with the same compiler version used for *HEASOFT* to ensure compatibility. Read the *HEASOFT* pages about compilers.

In order to compile the *python* wrappers, you need to have a working `python3` environment set up, including `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries.


## Compile the main code, *XSPEC* models and *python* wrapper

Run `make` to compile the main program `vKompth` source code, together with the corresponding *XSPEC* models and *python* wrappers, including the different model variants: **bb=blackbody** seed-photon source; **dk=diskbb** seed-photon source; **dual=two coronas**.

To run `vKompth` in multithread mode set, for instance:
```
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=2  #(BASH version)
setenv OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS 2  #(CSH version)
```


## Run the *python* wrapper

Go into `pyvkompth` subdirectory and run `python3 pyvkompth.py`. A GUI will load plotting both *rms* and *lags* for `vkompthbb` and `vkompthdk` model variants, allowing to modify parameters on-the-fly with intereactive sliders.


## Load and run the *XSPEC* models

In an XSPEC session, for instance, `vkompthbb` can be then loaded using:
```
lmod vkompthbb /PATHTO/vkompthbb/
```
(and similar commands for the other wrappers: `vkompthdk`, `vkdualbb` and `vkdualdk`).

Alternatively, the four model variants can be loaded using the `XSPEC` script provided as `@load_vkompth.xcm`. This script also includes plotting commands like `plrl` which can be used to produce a fancy plot for both *rms* and *lags* in *XSPEC* if data are loaded as `data 1:1 rms.pha 2:2 lag.pha`.

Examples of those can be found under the `MAXI_J1348-630` subdirectoy, which correspond to data published under [Bellavita et al. 2022, MNRAS in press](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13609).


## Preparing your own data

We also provide a `bash` script named `asciiTOvkompth.sh`, which uses `FTOOLS` to convert ASCII files with energy-dependent *rms*, *lags* and *time-averaged* spectra, into *PHA* and *RMF* FITS files fully compatible with our `vKompth` model variants (by including both *QPO frequency* and *mode* as *XFLT* variables for *XSPEC*).
