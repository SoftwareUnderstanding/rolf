Author: David Kipping, Columbia University
Journal reference: "Do planets remember how they formed?", MNRAS, accepted (arXiv e-prints:)

Visualizations: For those interested in visualizations, the PDF files depict the (sub-)microstates of the tally, integral and change-point planetary entropy methods described in the paper. The CDF files are Mathematica player files (https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/) which are 3D graphics depicting the microstates.

Code: exoinformatics.py contains all of the definitions needed to compute the microstates for each of three entropy methods. The example script test.py calls it for a random array of five planetary radii. Code is provided without commitment to support!
