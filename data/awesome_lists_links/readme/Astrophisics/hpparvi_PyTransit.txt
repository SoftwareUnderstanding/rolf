Fast and easy-to-use tools for exoplanet transit light curve modelling with Python. PyTransit offers optimised CPU and 
GPU implementations of popular exoplanet transit models with a unified interface, and thrives to be *the fastest and the 
most versatile* tool for transit modelling in Python. 

PyTransit makes transit model evaluation trivial whether modelling straightforward single-passband transit light curves or
more complex science-cases, such as transmission spectroscopy. Further, the model can be evaluated for a large set of
parameter sets simultaneously in parallel to optimize the evaluation speed with population-based MCMC samplers and 
optimization methods, such as emcee and  DE-MCMC.

```Python
from pytransit import QuadraticModel

tm = QuadraticModel()
tm.set_data(times)

tm.evaluate(k=0.1, ldc=[0.2, 0.1], t0=0.0, p=1.0, a=3.0, i=0.5*pi)

tm.evaluate(k=[0.10, 0.12], ldc=[[0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1]], t0=0.0, p=1.0, a=3.0, i=0.5*pi)

tm.evaluate(k=[[0.10, 0.12], [0.11, 0.13]], ldc=[[0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1],[0.4, 0.2, 0.75, 0.1]],
            t0=[0.0, 0.01], p=[1, 1], a=[3.0, 2.9], i=[.5*pi, .5*pi])
```

The package has been used in research since 2010, and is described in [Parviainen (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07433), which also details the model-specific optimisations and model performance.

  
## Examples and tutorials

### New tutorials

- [Tutorial 1: fitting a single transit](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/001_simple_broadband_parameter_estimation.ipynb). 
  A tutorial Jupyter notebook that teaches how to use PyTransit's `TransitAnalysis` class to fit a single transit light curve
  (well, actually we're estimating the posterior densities for the parameters in a transit model, but this sounds slightly
  more intimidating ;) )

### Old examples (may need to be )

- [TESS transit modelling example](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/tess_examples/WASP-4b.ipynb) 
  that reproduces the WASP-4b analysis by [Bouma et al. (2019)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..217B).

- [Third light contamination analysis examples](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/tree/master/notebooks/contamination)
  illustrate the use of the contamination module in transiting planet candidate validation with multicolour photometry, 
  as detailed in [Parviainen et al. (A&A, 2019)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2019/10/aa35709-19.pdf), and used 
  in [Parviainen et al. (A&A, 2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/01/aa35958-19.pdf).

## News
- **21.10.2020, version 2.5**
    - Version 2.5 makes modelling of TTVs trivial with ``pytransit.RoadRunnerModel`` and ``pytransit.QuadraticModel``.
    - See the [TTV modelling example notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/ttv_model_example.ipynb) for an example of how to evaluate the models for a TTV analysis.

- **14.10.2020, version 2.4**
    - Version 2.4 adds ``pytransit.EclipseModel`` to model secondary eclipses with as little hassle as possible.
    - See the [secondary eclipse model example notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/example_eclipse_model.ipynb)
    for an example of how to use it.

- **16.9.2020, Version 2.3** 
    - Version 2.3 adds ``OblateStarModel`` to model transits over gravity-darkened rapidly rotating star as presented by Barnes (2009).
    - See the [oblate star model example notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/osmodel_example_1.ipynb)
    for an example of usage.

- **13.9.2020, Version 2.2**
    - Version 2.2 brings a significant speedup to the evaluation speed of all models. The normalised planet-star distances are
    now calculated using a Taylor-series expansion of the planet's (x,y) sky-plane position. The method gives a 2-6 x speedup to the transit
    model evaluation and is detailed in Parviainen & Korth (2020, submitted to MNRAS)

- **7.7.2020, Version 2.1** 
    - Version 2.1 introduces the *RoadRunner* transit model (Parviainen, submitted to MNRAS, 2020), a fast exoplanet transit model 
    that can use any radially symmetric function to model stellar limb darkening while still being faster to evaluate than 
    the analytical transit model for quadratic limb darkening.
    - See the [basic example notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/roadrunner/roadrunner_model_example_1.ipynb),
   the [custom limb darkening notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/roadrunner/roadrunner_model_example_2.ipynb),
   and the [LDTk limb darkening model example notebook](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/blob/master/notebooks/roadrunner/roadrunner_model_example_3.ipynb).

  without modifications.
- The OpenCL implementations evaluated in a GPU can offer 10-20 x acceleration compared to the Python versions. 
- Simultaneous model computation for a set of parameter vectors accelerates population-based sampling and optimisation methods, 
  such as *Affine Invariant Sampling (emcee)* and *Differential Evolution*.

Notes
-----

 - The interpolated (quadratic) Mandel & Agol model offers the best performance at the moment, but needs to be initialised with the minimum and maximum allowed radius ratio.  
 - Please use the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit/issues) to report bugs and ideas for improvement.


Examples
--------
### Basics
Basic usage is simple, and the API is the same for all the models (with minor model-specific exceptions). The transit model 
is initialised with an array of mid-exposure times

```Python
from pytransit import QuadraticModel

tm = QuadraticModel()
tm.set_data(times)
```

after which it can be evaluated using either a set of scalar arguments (radius-ratio `k`, zero-epoch `t0`, orbital 
period `p`, scaled semi-major axis `a`, orbital inclination `i`, eccentricity `e`, and argument of periastron `w`) and
an array of limb darkening coefficients `ldc`

```Python
flux = tm.evaluate_ps(k,ldc,t0,p,a,i,e,w)
```

or using either a parameter array

```Python
flux = tm.evaluate_pv(pv, ldc)
```

where pv is either a 1d array `[k, t0, p, a, i, e, w]` or a 2d array with a shape `(npv, 7)` where `npv` is the
number of parameter vectors to evaluate simultaneously. Now, `flux` will be either a 1d array of model values evaluated
for each mid-exposure time, or a 2d array with a shape `(npv, npt)` where `npv` is the number of parameter vectors and 
`npt` the number of mid-exposure points. In the case of a 2d parameter array, also the limb darkening coefficients 
should be given as a 2d array.

### OpenCL
The OpenCL versions of the models work identically to the Python version, except 
that the OpenCL context and queue can be given as arguments in the initialiser, and the model evaluation method can be 
told to not to copy the model from the GPU memory. If the context and queue are not given, the model creates a default 
context using `cl.create_some_context()`.

```Python
from pytransit import QuadraticModelCL

tm = QuadraticModelCL(cl_ctx=ctx, cl_queue=queue)
```

### Supersampling
The transit models offer built-in *supersampling* for accurate modelling of long-cadence observations. The number of 
samples and the exposure time can be given when setting up the model

    tm.set_data(times, nsamples=10, exptimes=0.02)

### Heterogeneous time series

PyTransit allows for heterogeneous time series, that is, a single time series can contain several individual light curves 
(with, e.g., different time cadences and required supersampling rates) observed (possibly) in different passbands.

If a time series contains several light curves, it also needs the light curve indices for each exposure. These are given 
through `lcids` argument, which should be an array of integers. If the time series contains light curves observed in 
different passbands, the passband indices need to be given through `pbids` argument as an integer array, one per light 
curve. Supersampling can also be defined on per-light curve basis by giving the `nsamples`and `exptimes` as arrays with 
one value per light curve. 

For example, a set of three light curves, two observed in one passband and the third in another passband

    times_1 (lc = 0, pb = 0, sc) = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    times_2 (lc = 1, pb = 0, lc) = [3, 4]
    times_3 (lc = 2, pb = 1, sc) = [1, 5, 6]
    
Would be set up as

    tm.set_data(time  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6], 
                lcids = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 
                pbids = [0, 0, 1],
                nsamples = [  1,  10,   1],
                exptimes = [0.1, 1.0, 0.1])
                
Further, each passband requires two limb darkening coefficients, so the limb darkening coefficient array for a single parameter set should now be

    ldc = [u1, v1, u2, v2]

where u and v are the passband-specific quadratic limb darkening model coefficients.
