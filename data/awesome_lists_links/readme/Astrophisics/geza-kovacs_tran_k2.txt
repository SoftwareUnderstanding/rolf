1. I used *.txt extension to ALL files, because some editors may not 
   recognize (automatically) text files if they do not have *.txt type. 
   Of course, the codes/scripts should be used without this extension. 
2. The necessary info/readme files are: "paper_inf.txt", "file_format_inf.txt" 
   and "run_inf.txt".
