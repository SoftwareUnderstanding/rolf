Initial Conditions for Isolated CoLlisionless systEms

ICICLE is a python package for creating initial conditions for isolated collisionless systems that can then be used in NBody simulations. It currently supports the following profiles: NFW, Hernquist, King and Einasto.

Full documentation, including user instructions can be found in the file ICICLE_Documentation.pdf. If you use our code in your research, we kindly ask that you reference the following paper:
