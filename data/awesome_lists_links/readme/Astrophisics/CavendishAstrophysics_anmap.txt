# Anmap --- An image and data analysis system

Anmap is a system for the analysis and processing of images
and spectral data.  Originally written for use in Radio Astronomy,
much of its functionality is applicable to other disciplines and
the package is being enhanced by the addition of new algorithms
and analysis procedures of direct use in, for example, NMR
imaging and spectroscopy.  The unique feature of Anmap is the
emphasis placed on the analysis of data with an aim to extracting
quantitative results for comparison with theoretical models
and/or other experimantal data.  To achieve this Anmap provides:

*  A wide range of tools for analysis, fitting and modelling
(including standard image and data processing algorithms);

*  A powerful environment for users to develop their own
analysis/processing tools either by combining existing 
algorithms and facilities with the very powerful command
(scripting) language or by writing new routines in FORTRAN
which integrate seemlessly with the rest of Anmap.
