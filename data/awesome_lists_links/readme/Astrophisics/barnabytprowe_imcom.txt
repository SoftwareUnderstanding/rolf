IMCOM
=====

This is the public repository for the IMCOM (IMage COMbination) software
described in Rowe, Hirata & Rhodes (2011), available at the following url:
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...741...46R.

Within this repo please see imcom\_documentation.pdf for some (very) light
documentation describing how to use this early, prototype version (v0.2) of 
IMCOM.

The `./releases/` directory was originally there to gather tarballs together for
people not using version control!  This is no longer necessary after having
migrated the original repo from Hg to Git and putting it on GitHub, so these
will be removed from the repo before long.

However, that directory is still a good place to look for simple generic
Makefiles, example files etc.  The root directory for the repository is still
Barney's working directory (sorry), and so contains his machine specific
Makefile.  This will all be improved in the near future, I promise.

For theoretical details and discussion of the precise implementation that 
we follow in IMCOM, please see the Rowe et al (2011) paper referenced above.

General queries may be directed towards the issues pages on the GitHub
repository: https://github.com/barnabytprowe/imcom/issues
