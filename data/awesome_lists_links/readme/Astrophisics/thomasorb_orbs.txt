conda activate orb3
pip install gitdb --no-deps 
pip install smmap --no-deps
pip install gitpython --no-deps

You will also need cfitsio. On Ubuntu you can install it with

#### Install orbs module

During ORB install you have already created a folder name `orb-stable`. You can thus do

cd path/to/orb-stable
git clone https://github.com/thomasorb/orbs.git
python setup.py install # not for developer
```
**(developer only)**
```bash
cd
echo '/absolute/path/to/orb-stable/orbs' >> miniconda3/envs/orb3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/conda.pth
```

Test it:
```bash
conda activate orb3 # you don't need to do it if you are already in the orb3 environment
python -c 'import orbs.core'
```
