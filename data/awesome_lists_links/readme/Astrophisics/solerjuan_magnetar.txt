MAGNETAR
==================================

MAGNETAR is set of tools for the study of the magnetic field in simulations of MHD turbulence and polarization observations.

MAGNETAR calculates the histogram of relative orientation between density structure in the magnetic field in data cubes from simulations of MHD turbulence and observations of polarization using the method of histogram of relative orientations (HRO).
