Code for our paper ["Extreme close approaches in hierarchical triple systems with comparable masses"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10249), N. Haim & B. Katz, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 479, Issue 3, September 2018 ([MNRAS version](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/3/3155/5039666))

The code includes the simulations done in the paper.

## Is my system about to collide?

For a quick prediction if your three-body system is about to collide simply plug your initial conditions 
in [predict_collision_from_initial_conditions.py](https://github.com/nivha/three_body_integration/blob/master/predict_collision_from_initial_conditions.py)
