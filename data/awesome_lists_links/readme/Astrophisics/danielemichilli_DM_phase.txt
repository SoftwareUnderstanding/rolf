# DM_phase

Find the best Dispersion Measure for a pulse by maximising the coherent power accross the bandwidth. 
It is robust to complex burst structures and interference.

## Getting Started

The necessary dependences will be installed automatically, except `psrchive` (see Prerequisites).
Run `python DM_phase.py -h` for a list of arguments.
Basic example: `python DM_phase.py fname`, where `fname` is the filename of a PSRCHIVE object.
Alternatively, it is possible to run the function `get_DM` on a 2D numpy array representing the pulse waterfall.
See the function documentation for details.

### Prerequisites

Python module of `psrchive` is required to read PSRCHIVE files and it will not be installed automatically. See the [package page](http://psrchive.sourceforge.net/manuals/python/).

### Installing

```
pip install DM_phase
```
