# Relativistic Effects in Ultra-Large-Scale Clustering

<span style="font-variant: small-caps">HorizonGRound</span> is a Python
package that offers tools for forward modelling of general relativistic
effects from the tracer luminosity function as well as comparing relativistic
corrections with the local primordial non-Gaussianity signature in
ultra-large-scale clustering statistics.


## Installation

To install, enter in bash:

```bash
pip install HorizonGRound
```
