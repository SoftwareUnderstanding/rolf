# starsense_algorithms
This is a software package for testing and performance evaluation of various star sensors. The algorithms used are : centroiding, geometric voting and QUEST algorithms. The physical parameters of a star sensor are parametrized and by changing these parameters various performance estimators like sky coverage, memory requirement, timing requirements etc can be estimated for the selected star sensor. 
The codes for performance estimation are written in MATLAB.
