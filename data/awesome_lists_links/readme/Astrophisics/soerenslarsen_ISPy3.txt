# ISPy3
Tools for Integrated-light Spectroscopy with Python3.

ISPy3 is a collection of Python routines that can be used to model and analyse the spectra of stars and stellar populations. 
The actual spectral modelling and related tasks (setting up model atmospheres, etc) is done via external codes, available via the links below.
Currently, the Kurucz codes (ATLAS/SYNTHE) and MARCS/TurboSpectrum are supported.
