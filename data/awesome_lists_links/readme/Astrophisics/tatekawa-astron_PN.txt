Limit-sticky9.c

N-body simulation code for stellar cluster which includes massive object

This code is implemented limited 1PN approximation. The code is based
on sticky9 code.
The interaction between one massive object and stars are given by
1PN approximation. The interaction between stars are described by
Newtonian gravity.

One sample of the result by this code is shown in 
arXiv:1801.07986.

This code can be compiled by GNU compiler. For acceleration with NVIDIA GPU,
goose compiler is required.

Furthermore, the compiler can be executed on CUDA 4.2 or earlier.
Unfortunately, goose compiler cannot execute on CentOS 7. Therefore,
for example, virtual machine with CentOS 6 must be prepared. The source
code is compiled on CentOS 6. Then execution should be transferred to
CentOS 7 with CUDA 4.2.

Goose compiler can generate cuda C source code. The code can be executed
on CUDA 4.2 or earlier, too. We are welcome to improve the code to
correspond to CUDA 5.0 or later.

The integration scheme is given by 4th-order Runge-Kutta scheme.
