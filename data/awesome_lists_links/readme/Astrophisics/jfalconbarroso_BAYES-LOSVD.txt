# BAYES-LOSVD

BAYES-LOSVD is a python framework for the non-parametric extraction of the Line-Of-Sight Velocity Distributions in galaxies. It makes use of Stan (https://mc-stan.org/) to perform all the computations and provide reliable uncertainties for all the parametes of the model chosen for the fit. The code comes with a large number of features, including read-in routines for some of the most popular IFU spectrographs and surveys: ATLAS3D, CALIFA, MaNGA, MUSE-WFM, SAMI, SAURON.
