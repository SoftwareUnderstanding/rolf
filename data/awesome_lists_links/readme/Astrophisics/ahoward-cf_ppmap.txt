# PPMAP
A Bayesian point process algorithm for column density mapping with extra dimensions (temperature and dust opacity index).

PPMAP was developed by [Ken Marsh](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/science/staff/kenneth-marsh). 

PPMAP was first described in [Marsh, et al. 2015, **MNRAS 454**](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stv2248).

PPMAP is currently maintained by [Alexander Howard](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/913995-howard-alexander)

PPMAP is undergoing development. If you would like to run PPMAP, please contact Alexander Howard directly at alexander.howard@astro.cf.ac.uk for help in installing and running PPMAP. 

The current implimentation is for the Super Computing Wales Hawk architecture which utilises the Slurm workload manager. 

Early documentation, including installation instructions, can be found at [https://ppmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://ppmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
