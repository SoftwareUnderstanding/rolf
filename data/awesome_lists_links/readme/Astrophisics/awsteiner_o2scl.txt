This is the README for the github mirror of O2scl. The full library
documentation for the most recent release version is available at
https://neutronstars.utk.edu/code/o2scl. If you obtained O2scl from
a full release distribution rather than directly from the source code
repository, then the HTML documentation is in
doc/o2scl/html/index.html and the PDF documentation is in
doc/o2scl/latex/refman.pdf.
