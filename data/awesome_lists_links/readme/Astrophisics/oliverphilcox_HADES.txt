# HADES
A Hexadecapolar Analysis for Dust Estimation in Simulations (of CMB B-mode thermal dust emission)

This is a Python package to analyse dust levels in simulated CMB galactic dust maps with realistic experimental noise and lensing configurations. Code (developed by Oliver Philcox (Cambridge/Harvard), Blake Sherwin (Cambridge) and Alex van Engelen (CITA) allows detection of dust via its anisotropy properties in CMB B-modes. Also, techniques for computing null-tests and a rudimentary technique for dedusting is also included.

A tutorial is included [here](https://github.com/oliverphilcox/HADES/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb):

The code in this repository forms the basis of the MNRAS paper of Philcox, Sherwin & van Engelen (2018) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09177)) which should be cited in all cases. Please contact [Oliver](ohep2@alumni.cam.ac.uk) for any questions or help with this code.
