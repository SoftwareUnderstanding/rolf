# mTransport

mTransport is an automated tool that
computes the 2-point-correlation function of the curvature and tensor 
perturbations in multifield models of inflation in the presence of a curved field space. It is an implementation of 
the transport method which encompasses 
scenarios with violations of slow-roll conditions and turns of the trajectory 
in field space. It can be used for an arbitrary mass spectrum, 
including massive modes, particle production and models 
with quasi-single-field dynamics. 

It has been written by Mafalda Dias, Jonathan Frazer and David Seery. 

## How to cite mTransport

The transport method uses evolution equations for the correlation functions 
of primordial perturbations to compute observables. Details on this method and 
its current implementation for curved field-spaces are described in:
