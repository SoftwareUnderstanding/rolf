# SOPT: Sparse OPTimisation
------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

SOPT is a C++ package to perform Sparse OPTimisation. It solves a variety of sparse regularisation
problems, including the SARA algorithm. Prototype Matlab implementations of various algorithms are
also included.

## Contributors

SOPT was initially created by Rafael Carrillo, Jason McEwen and Yves Wiaux but major contributions
have since been made by a number of others. The full list of contributors is as follows:

### Python pre-requisites and dependencies

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/): Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/): User-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines
  for numerical integration and optimization

### Installing Sopt

Once the dependencies are present, the program can be built with:

```
cd /path/to/code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

To test everything went all right:

```
cd /path/to/code/build
ctest .
```

To install in directory `/X`, with libraries going to `X/lib`, python modules to
`X/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages/sopt`, etc, do:

```
cd /path/to/code/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/X ..
make install
```


## Support
