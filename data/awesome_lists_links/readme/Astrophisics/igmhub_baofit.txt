======

baofit is a software package for analyzing cosmological correlation functions to estimate parameters related to baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. The code has primarily been used to analyse Lyman-alpha forest autocorrelations and cross correlations with the quasar number density in BOSS data. Fit models are fully three-dimensional and include flexible treatments of redshift-space distortions, anisotropic non-linear broadening, and broadband distortions.

For a more detailed description of the fitting methods, see ["Fitting Methods for Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in Lyman-alpha Forest Fluctuations of BOSS Data Release 9" (Kirkby et al., 2013)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3456).
