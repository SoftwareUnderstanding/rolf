Sherpa
======

Sherpa is a modeling and fitting application for Python. It contains a
powerful language for combining simple models into complex expressions
that can be fit to the data using a variety of statistics and
optimization methods.  It is easily extensible to include user models,
statistics, and optimization methods.  It provides a high-level User
Interface for interactive data-analysis work, such as within a
Jupyter notebook, and it can also be used as a library component,
providing fitting and modeling capabilities to an application.

What can you do with Sherpa?

- fit 1D (multiple) data including: spectra, surface brightness profiles, light curves, general ASCII arrays
- fit 2D images/surfaces in Poisson/Gaussian regime
- build complex model expressions
- import and use your own models
- use appropriate statistics for modeling Poisson or Gaussian data
- import new statistics, with priors if required by analysis
- visualize the parameter space with simulations or using 1D/2D cuts of the parameter space
- calculate confidence levels on the best fit model parameters
- choose a robust optimization method for the fit: Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead Simplex or Monte Carlo/Differential Evolution.

Documentation for Sherpa is available at
[Read The Docs](https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/)
and also for [Sherpa in CIAO](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/).

A [Quick Start Tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sherpa/sherpa/tree/main/notebooks/SherpaQuickStart.ipynb)
is included in the `notebooks` folder and can be opened with an `ipython notebook`.

How To Install Sherpa
=====================

[Full installation instructions](https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
are part of the [Read The Docs](https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/)
documentation, and should be read if the following is not sufficient.

It is strongly recommended that some form of *virtual environment* is
used with Sherpa.

Sherpa is tested against Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

The last version of Sherpa which supported Python 2.7 is
[Sherpa 4.11.1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3358134).

Using Anaconda
--------------

Sherpa is provided for both Linux and macOS operating systems running
Python 3.8 to 3.10. It can be installed with the `conda`
package manager by saying

    $ conda install -c sherpa sherpa

Using pip
---------

Sherpa is also available
[on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sherpa) and so can be installed
with the following command (which requires that the NumPy package is
already installed).

    % pip install sherpa

Building from source
--------------------

Source installation is available for platforms incompatible with the
binary builds, or for when the default build options are not sufficient
(such as including support for the
[`XSPEC` model library](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/)).
The steps are described in the
[building from source](https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#building-from-source)
documentation.

History
=======

Sherpa is developed by the [Chandra X-ray
Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/) to provide fitting and modelling
capabilities to the [CIAO](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/) analysis package. It
has been released onto [GitHub](https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa) for users to
extend (whether to other areas of Astronomy or in other domains).
