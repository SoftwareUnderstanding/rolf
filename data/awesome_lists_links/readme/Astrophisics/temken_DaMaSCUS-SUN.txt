Dark Matter Simulation Code for Underground Scatterings - Sun Edition

<img width="350" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29034913/108851182-73c1b500-75e4-11eb-94fd-11b93a3af0ae.png">

DaMaSCUS-SUN is a Monte Carlo tool simulating the process of solar reflection of dark matter (DM) particles as described in detail in [this publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12483).

## General Notes

- Solar reflection is the process of a DM particle from the galactic halo falling into the gravitational well of the Sun, where it can scatter on hot nuclei or electrons. If the DM particle scatters and escapes the Sun we consider it as "reflected".
- With DaMaSCUS-SUN we can describe this process by simulating individual DM particle's trajectories inside the Sun and in the solar system.
- Based on the Monte Carlo simulations, we can estimate the properties of the dark particle flux ejected from the Sun and derive e.g. exclusion limits.
- DaMaSCUS-SUN is written in C++ and built with CMake.
- The code is fully parallelized with MPI and can run on HPC clusters.

For more physics details, we refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12483).

## Getting started

<details><summary>1. Dependencies</summary>
<p>

Before we can install DaMaSCUS-SUN, we need to make sure that a few dependencies are taken care of.

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): DaMaSCUS-SUN as well as the libraries libphysica and obscura are built with CMake.
- [boost](https://www.boost.org/): For numerical integration (used by libphysica).
- [libconfig](https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig): For the configuration files, DaMaSCUS-SUN uses the libconfig library (required version at least 1.6). 
- [libphysica](https://github.com/temken/libphysica): Automatically downloaded to */external/obscura/external/*, compiled, and linked by CMake.
- [obscura](https://github.com/temken/obscura): Automatically downloaded to */external/*, compiled, and linked by CMake.
- [open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/): For the parallelization DaMaSCUS-SUN uses the open Message Passing Interface (MPI). Open MPI can be installed on Macs using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):


<details><summary>Installation of boost</summary>
<p>

```

```

But before running DaMaSCUS-SUN, the user has to specify the scenario to be simulated by DaMaSCUS-SUN by setting a number of input parameters in the configuration file *config.cfg*.

</p>
</details>


<details><summary>4. The configuration file</summary>
<p>

In the configuration file, the user decides what scenario of solar reflection to simulate with DaMaSCUS-SUN.
A number of parameters need to be specified and they are described here.


| Note, that the handling of the input files by libconfig is sensitive to the data type. For example, a DM mass of 1 GeV has to be set as "1.0", **not** "1". |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

1. First of all, it makes sense to give the simulation run a unique ID. All results will be saved under */results/identifier/*.

```
//DaMaSCUS-SUN - Configuration File

//ID
	ID		=	"identifier";
```

2. Next we need to decide if we run a single parameter point, or scan a grid of parameters to find detection exclusion limits. In either case, we need to specify the minimal number of data points to be generated by DaMaSCUS-SUN.

```
//Run mode
	run_mode = "Parameter point";	//Options: "Parameter scan" or "Parameter point"

	sample_size 		=	100;
	interpolation_points	=	1000;	//The scattering rate is interpolated on a NxN grid to speed up the simulations.
						//Recommended value: 1000
						//Set to 0 to run without interpolation.
```

3. If we run a parameter scan and compute exclusion limits, we need to specify the parameter grid.

```
//Options for "Parameter point"
	isoreflection_rings 		=	3;

// Options for "Parameter scan"
	compute_halo_constraints	= 	true;
	perform_full_scan		=	false;	//Full scan or STA contour tracing
	
	constraints_certainty		=	0.95;	//Certainty level
	
	constraints_mass_min		=	2.0e-6;	//in GeV										
	constraints_mass_max		=	1.0e-3;	//in GeV
	constraints_masses		=	5;

	cross_section_min 		=	1.0e-37;// in cm*cm
	cross_section_max 		=	1.0e-32;// in cm*cm	
	cross_sections			=	5;

```

4. The next block determines the DM particle properties. In the case of a "Parameter point" run, we need to set the DM mass and cross sections.

```
//Dark matter particle
	DM_mass		  		=	0.001;	// in GeV
	DM_spin		  		=	0.5;
	DM_fraction			=	1.0;	// the DM particle's fractional abundance (set to 1.0 for 100%)
	DM_light			=	true;	// Options: true or false. low mass mode

	DM_interaction			=	"SI";	// Options: "SI", "SD", or "DP"

	DM_isospin_conserved		=	true;   // only relevant for SI and SD
	DM_relative_couplings		=	(1.0, 0.0); //relation between proton (left) and neutron (right) couplings (only relevant if 'DM_isospin_conserved' is false.)
	DM_cross_section_nucleon	=	1.0e-80;    //in cm^2
	DM_cross_section_electron	=	1.0e-35;    //in cm^2 (only relevant for SI and SD)
	DM_form_factor			=	"Contact";	// Options: "Contact", "Electric-Dipole", "Long-Range", "General" (only relevant for SI and DP)
	DM_mediator_mass		=	0.0;	// in MeV (only relevant if 'DM_form_factor' is "General")

```

5. For the direct detection experiment, we can either choose one of the pre-defined experimental analyses or define an experiment ourselves.

```
//Dark matter detection experiment
	DD_experiment	=	"SENSEI@MINOS";	//Options for nuclear recoils: "Nuclear recoil", "DAMIC-2012", "XENON1T-2017", "CRESST-II","CRESST-III", "CRESST-surface"
 										//Options for electron recoils: "Semiconductor","protoSENSEI@MINOS","protoSENSEI@surface", "SENSEI@MINOS", "CDMS-HVeV", "Ionization", "XENON10-S2", "XENON100-S2", "XENON1T-S2", "DarkSide-50-S2"

	//Options for user-defined experiments ("Nuclear recoil", "Ionization", and "Semiconductor")
	//General
	DD_exposure 		=	300.0;	//in kg years
	DD_efficiency 		=	1.0;	//flat efficiency
	DD_observed_events 	=	0;	//observed signal events
	DD_expected_background 	=	0.0;	//expected background events

	//Specific options for "Nuclear recoil"
	DD_targets_nuclear	=	(
					(4.0, 8),
					(1.0, 20),
					(1.0, 74)
					);	// Nuclear targets defined by atom ratio/abundances and Z
	DD_threshold_nuclear	=	0.1;	//in keV
	DD_Emax_nuclear		=	40.0;	//in keV
	DD_energy_resolution	=	0.0;	//in keV
	
	//Specific options for Ionization and Semiconductor:
	DD_target_electron	=	"Xe";	//Options for Ionization: 	Xe, Ar
			    	//Options for Semiconductor:	Si, Ge
	DD_threshold_electron	=	4; //In number of electrons or electron hole pairs.
```

6. The initial conditons of our simulations are sampled from the DM halo model, which is determined by the following parameters.

```
//Dark matter distribution
	DM_distribution     =	"SHM";  //Options: "SHM"
	DM_local_density    =	0.4;	//in GeV / cm^3
	
	//Options for "SHM"
	SHM_v0		=	220.0;			//in km/sec
	SHM_vObserver	=	(11.1, 232.2, 7.3);	//in km/sec
	SHM_vEscape	=	544.0;			//in km/sec

```
