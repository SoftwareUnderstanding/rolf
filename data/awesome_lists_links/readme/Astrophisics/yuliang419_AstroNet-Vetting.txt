This directory contains TensorFlow models and data processing code for
identifying exoplanets in astrophysical light curves. For complete background on how CNNs work for planet detection, see [Shallue & Vanderburg's paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155...94S) in
*The Astronomical Journal*. This is the vetting version of our two TESS neural networks. For the triage version, see https://github.com/yuliang419/Astronet-Triage.

### Download TESS Data

A *light curve* is a plot of the brightness of a star over time. We will be
focusing on light curves produced by the TESS space telescope. An example
light curve (produced by Kepler) is shown below.

![Kepler-934](docs/kepler-943.png)

To train a model to identify planets in TESS light curves, you will need a
training set of labeled *Threshold Crossing Events* (TCEs). A TCE is a periodic
signal that has been detected in a Kepler light curve, and is associated with a
*period* (the number of days between each occurrence of the detected signal),
a *duration* (the time taken by each occurrence of the signal), an *epoch* (the
time of the first observed occurrence of the signal), and possibly additional
metadata like the signal-to-noise ratio. An example TCE is shown below. The
labels are ground truth classifications (decided by humans) that indicate which
TCEs in the training set are actual planets signals and which are caused by
other phenomena.

![Kepler-934 Transits](docs/kepler-943-transits.png)

**The CSV creation step needs to be run on PDO, but I have included the complete CSV file (`astronet/tces.csv`) that I used to train the model.**

The TESS TCE lists for each sector are available on the TEV website. Download them as CSVs, and run `make_catalog.py` in the `data` folder to create a catalog that combines all sectors. e.g.:

```
python make_catalog.py --input sector-1-earlylook.csv sector-2-bright.csv sector-3-01.csv sector-3-02.csv --num_worker_processes=20 --base_dir=[wherever your csv file is] --out_name=tces.csv
```
The output will be a CSV file named `tces.csv` (in the same directory as your input CSV file) with the following columns:

* `row_id`: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.
* `tic_id`: TIC ID of the target star.
* `toi_id`: TCE number within the target star. These are structured funny so we'll ignore them for now.
* `Disposition`: Final disposition from group vetting (should be one of the following: PC (planet candidate), EB (eclipsing binary), IS (instrumental noise), V (variability), O (other), J (junk). The J class includes a mix of V and IS. I didn't distinguish all of them since these two are always lumped together anyway.
* `RA`: RA in degrees.
* `DEC`: Dec in degrees.
* `Tmag`: TESS magnitude.
* `Epoc`: The time corresponding to the center of the first detected
event in Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) minus a constant offset.
* `Period`: Period of the detected event, in days.
* `Duration`: Duration of the detected event, in hours.
* `Transit Depth`: Transit depth in ppm.
* `Sectors`: Sector number.
* `camera`: Camera number.
* `ccd`: CCD number.
* `star_rad`, `star_mass`, `teff`, `logg`: Stellar parameters from Gaia DR2 or the TIC. Since a lot of TCEs are missing these values, we're not using them right now.
* `SN`: Signal-to-pink noise ratio from BLS.
* `q_ingress`: Fractional ingress duration from VARTOOLS.

The catalog creation step may take a while to run, depending on how many TCEs there are. For entire sectors, I'd recommend using at least 20 workers in parallel, or it will take forever. Set `num_worker_processes` to 1 to turn off multiprocessing.

Light curves are stored as h5 files on PDO, in e.g. `/pdo/qlp-data/sector-2/ffi/cam1/ccd1/LC/ `. Download all the light curves you need from one sector and store them in a local directory called `astronet/tess/sector-X` (no need to subdivide by camera and ccd).

If working with TCEs that are not available on TEV, start by creating a .txt file of TIC IDs of all TCEs that you wish to include, and name the file `sector-x-yyy.txt`, where `x` is the sector number and `yyy` is an optional string. Then run `make_empty_catalog.py` in the `data` directory to create a csv file in a specified location (named `sector-X-all.csv`) with only a few columns filled in, e.g.:

```
python make_empty_catalog.py --base_dir=[wherever you text file is] --input sector-4-bad.txt sector-4-good.txt --save_dir=[wherever you want to save the output]
```

Note that the csv file created this way will have a disposition of `J` for all TCEs, because I mostly used this to create catalogs of junk that didn't make it to group vetting.

Then, run `make_catalog.py` as usual to create a CSV file with the rest of the columns filled in.


### Process TESS Data

**All the following steps can be run on any computer that has TESS h5 files stored in a single folder, divided by sector. If you don't have access to the original h5 files, I have included all the TFRecords used in my paper under `astronet/tfrecords` so you can skip the training set generation step.**

To train a model to identify exoplanets, you will need to provide TensorFlow
with training data in
[TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets) format. The
TFRecord format consists of a set of sharded files containing serialized
`tf.Example` [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

The command below will generate a set of sharded TFRecord files for the TCEs in
the training set. Each `tf.Example` proto will contain the following light curve
representations:

* `global_view`: Vector of length 201: a "global view" of the TCE.
* `local_view`: Vector of length 61: a "local view" of the TCE.

In addition, each `tf.Example` will contain the value of each column in the
input TCE CSV file, including transit and stellar parameters.

Disclaimer: I haven't figured out how to make Bazel work, so just use the plain python version for now.

To generate the training set:
```bash
# The original Astronet used Bazel, but we could just invoke the source scripts with the 
# following addition to PYTHONPATH:
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/source/dir/:${PYTHONPATH}"

# Filename containing the CSV file of TCEs in the training set.
TCE_CSV_FILE="astronet/tces.csv"

# Directory to save output TFRecord files into.
TFRECORD_DIR="astronet/tfrecord"

# Directory where light curves are located.
TESS_DATA_DIR="astronet/tess/"
  
# Run without bazel
python astronet/data/generate_input_records.py \
--input_tce_csv_file=${TCE_CSV_FILE} \
--tess_data_dir=${TESS_DATA_DIR} \
--output_dir=${TFRECORD_DIR} \
--num_worker_processes=5 
```
If `--clean` is included as an argument, the train and validation sets will only contain TCEs with S/N above some threshold (specified by the `--threshold` argument, default 15).

If the optional `--make_test_set` argument is included, the code will generate 8 test sets instead of 8 training, 1 validation and 1 test. This is useful for creating test sets out of new data and using them to evaluate a model trained on older data. Setting `--clean` here would produce test sets containing only TCEs with S/N above some threshold.

When the script finishes you will find 8 training files, 1 validation file and
1 test file in `TFRECORD_DIR`. The files will match the patterns
`train-0000?-of-00008`, `val-00000-of-00001` and `test-00000-of-00001`
respectively.

Here's a quick description of what the script does. For a full description, see
Section 3 of [our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta).

For TESS light curves, background variability has already been removed (mostly), so the spline-fitting step in the original paper is not necessary. 

For each TCE in the input CSV table, we generate two representations of
the light curve of that star. Both representations are *phase-folded*, which
means that we combine all periods of the detected TCE into a single curve, with
the detected event centered.

Here's an example of the generated representations (Kepler-90 g) in the output.

```python
# Launch iPython (or Python) from the tensorflow_models/astronet/ directory.
ipython

In[1]:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os.path
import tensorflow as tf

In[2]:
TIC_ID = 270341214
TFRECORD_DIR = "/path/to/tfrecords/dir"

In[3]:
# Helper function to find the tf.Example corresponding to a particular TCE.
def find_tce(tic_id, filenames):
  for filename in filenames:
    for record in tf.python_io.tf_record_iterator(filename):
      ex = tf.train.Example.FromString(record)
      if ex.features.feature["tic_id"].int64_list.value[0] == tic_id:
        print("Found {} in file {}".format(tic_id, filename))
        return ex
        raise ValueError("{} not found in files: {}".format(tic_id, filenames))

In[4]:
# Find sample TCE
filenames = tf.gfile.Glob(os.path.join(TFRECORD_DIR, "*"))
assert filenames, "No files found in {}".format(TFRECORD_DIR)
ex = find_tce(TIC_ID, filenames)

In[5]:
# Plot the global and local views.
global_view = np.array(ex.features.feature["global_view"].float_list.value)
local_view = np.array(ex.features.feature["local_view"].float_list.value)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 6))
axes[0].plot(global_view, ".")
axes[1].plot(local_view, ".")
plt.show()
```

The output should look something like this:

### Train an AstroNet Model

The [astronet](astronet/) directory contains several types of neural
network architecture and various configuration options. This particular version is configured to detect objects that can plausibly be planets (including PCs and EBs whose stellar variability amplitudes are less than half the depths of the eclipses).
To train a convolutional
neural network to classify TESS TCEs as either "likely planet" or "not planet",
using the best configuration from
[our paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa9e09/meta),
run the following training script:

```bash
# Directory to save model checkpoints into.
MODEL_DIR="astronet/model/"
  
# Run without Bazel
python astronet/train.py \
--model=AstroCNNModel \
--config_name=local_global \
--train_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/train* \
--eval_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/val* \
--model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} \
--train_steps=14000
  
```
Optionally, you can also run a [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
server in a separate process for real-time
monitoring of training progress and evaluation metrics.

```bash
# Launch TensorBoard server.
tensorboard --logdir ${MODEL_DIR}
```

The TensorBoard server will show a page like this:

![TensorBoard](docs/tensorboard.png)

The "loss" plot shows both training and validation losses. The optimum number of training steps is where validation loss reaches a minimum.

### Model Averaging
You can train a set of 10 models with random initializations and average their outputs when making predictions. This helps prevent overfitting and makes the model more robust. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
./astronet/ensemble_train.sh ${MODEL_DIR} 14000 ${TFRECORD_DIR}
```
The 14000 here is the number of train steps I used for each model. The code will produce 10 subdirectories under `${MODEL_DIR}`. 

Four fully trained, averaged models can be found under `astronet/models_final`. `model_dc_se` is the final version presented in my paper, with secondary eclipses and depth change included in the model. `model_plain` is the original `AstroNet` architecture without the two newly added features. `model_dc` and `model_se` are models with only depth change or only secondary eclipses added.

### Evaluate an AstroNet Model

Run the following command to evaluate a model on the test set. The result will
be printed on the screen, and a summary file will also be written to the model
directory, which will be visible in TensorBoard.

```bash
  
# Run evaluation script
python astronet/evaluate.py \
--model=AstroCNNModel \
--config_name=local_global \
--eval_files=${TFRECORD_DIR}/test* \
--model_dir=${MODEL_DIR}
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
INFO:tensorflow:Saving dict for global step 10000: accuracy/accuracy = 0.9625159, accuracy/num_correct = 1515.0, auc = 0.988882, confusion_matrix/false_negatives = 10.0, confusion_matrix/false_positives = 49.0, confusion_matrix/true_negatives = 1165.0, confusion_matrix/true_positives = 350.0, global_step = 10000, loss = 0.112445444, losses/weighted_cross_entropy = 0.11295206, num_examples = 1574.
```

To plot the misclassified TCEs and calculate precision and recall at various thresholds, do the following:

```bash
python astronet/find_incorrect.py --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} --tfrecord_dir=${TFRECORD_DIR} --suffix=yyy --average
```

This produces plots of the global and local views of misclassified TCEs in a folder called `astronet/plots` and generates a text file called `true_vs_pred_yyy.txt` with two columns: the true disposition of each TCEs in the test set (0 = junk, 1 = PC or EB), the predicted probability of each TCE being a positive. If you trained an ensemble of models and want to use model averaging, include a `--average` argument and make sure `${MODEL_DIR}` is set to the directory that contains the 10 subdirectories. If there's no `--average` argument, `${MODEL_DIR}` is just the directory containing your single model.

To plot the precision-recall curve, run `plot_roc.py` with the appropriate true_vs_pred file (you'll have to modify the code directly).


### Make Predictions

The easiest way to make predictions for a list of new TCEs is to run `generate_input_records.py` following instructions above with the `--make_test_set` argument included, such that all the new TCEs to be classified are stored as tfrecords. Then run the following:

```bash
# Make a directory for plots
mkdir astronet/plots
SAVE_DIR=astronet/plots

# Generate a prediction for a list of new TCEs.
python astronet/batch_predict.py \
  --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} \
  --tfrecord_dir=${TFRECORD_DIR} \
  --suffix=yyy \
  --average \
  --plot \
  --save_dir=${SAVE_DIR}
```

If the option `--plot` argument is included, you must also include a `--save_dir`. Plots of the global and local views of TCEs in the test set will be saved under that directory.

If you trained an ensemble of models and want to use model averaging, include a `--average` argument and make sure `${MODEL_DIR}` is set to the directory that contains the 10 subdirectories. If there's no `--average` argument, `${MODEL_DIR}` is just the directory containing your single model.

The output of this step is a file called `prediction_yyy.txt`, saved in your current directory. This file contains the TIC ID of each object in your input list, and the model's prediction of the object being a plausible planet candidate. In this version (triage), that means the object is likely either a PC or an EB without too much stellar activity.
