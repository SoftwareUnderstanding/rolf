# TTVFaster
First order eccentricity transit timing variations (TTVs) computed in [Agol &amp; Deck (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01623)

This implements equation (33) from that paper by computing the Laplace
coefficients using a series solution due to Jack Wisdom, computing
the f_{1,j}^{(+-k)} coefficients given in equation (34) using the functions u and
v_+- with coefficients given in Table 1.

Here is an example of using the code in  IDL:

This computes the TTVs for a system similar to Kepler-62e/f stored
in the file kepler62ef_planet.txt.  The TTVs will be plotted to
the screen.

Here is an example of using the code in Julia:

This computes the TTVs for a system similar to Kepler-62e/f stored
in the file kepler62ef_planet.txt.  The TTVs will be written
to the files inner_ttv.txt and outer_ttv.txt, as well as
stored in the variables ttv1 and ttv2.  The test_ttv.jl routine
accepts jmax (the maximum j to sum to, in this example 5),
ntime1 (number of transits of the inner planet), ntime2 (the
number of transits of the outer planet), and data which contains
the parameters of the planet.

The file kepler62ef_planets.txt contains a comma-separated
set of 10 parameters that describe the system:  \mu,t0,Period,
e cos(omega), e sin(omega) for each planet, where \mu is
the mass ratio of the planet to the star, t0 is the initial
transit time (of the averaged orbit), Period is the mean orbital
period, e is the eccentricity, and omega is the longitude of
periastron.

An example of using the C version of this code:

to compile:

```bash
gcc -o predict_formula predict_formula.c -lm -O3 -Wall
```

to run:

```bash
./predict_formula 2 test_ic2 0 1600 6 output_test_ic2
./executable    n_planets   param_file t0 tfinal jmax output_file
```


param_file format:

```
mstar m1 p1 e1*cos(arg peri1) i1 Omega1 e1*sin(arg peri1) TT1
+ repeat for remaining planets
```

Units are hardwired into predict_formula.c in the definition of G (global variable, at top) to be masses/solar masses distance/AU and time/day.

all angles are in radians

TT1 = the initial time of transit (according to the mean ephemeris). Make sure that your t0 in the input line matches the t0 your initial transits are refered to in the parameter file!

orbital elements are averaged orbital elements

inclinations do not enter the formula at all; they are in fact never used by the code. Omega is used only to determine the true anomaly of the planet at transit, according to the (hardwired) reference direction that at transit the true longitude is 0.0.

Hence Omega = -PI/2 and i=PI/2 implies an edge on orbit with the ascending node in the plane of the sky.

the output file is:
Planet # (zero based) Transit # (zero based) Transit time
