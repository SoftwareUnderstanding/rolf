Web-based pedagogical stellar modeling
Approximate stellar atmospheric and spectral line modeling in JavaScript with visualization in HTML.  
Suitable for wide range of educationa and public outreach (EPO) levels depending on which
optional plots and print-outs are turned on.
All plots and renderings are pure basic HTML (no libraries) - the plotting module contains
original HTML equivalents to IDL's axis procedure for automatically scaling
and graduating x- and y-axes, etc.  
MIT license.  Collaborative development of the physics and UI is encouraged.  I'm sure there 
should be open "issues"  :-)
