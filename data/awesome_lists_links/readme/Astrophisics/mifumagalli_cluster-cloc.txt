Here is the code that deploys the methodology presented in da Silva et al 2014, MNRAS, 438, 2355
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.438.2355D

It deploys C++ routines to calculate analytic approximations of the Luminosity PDFs for the most luminous clusters.

While we do attempt to keep things as accurate and up-to-date as possible for legal reasons we do not make any guarantees nor do we accept any responsibility for anyone using the code. No warranty is expressed or implied for any portion of this part of this software.

At the moment, CLOC is not well documented. CLOC is a C++ routine that has 2 python wrappers. fall_cpp_wrapper.py wraps 
the C++ routine to produce outputs and parse.py parses the outputs.
