## relxill - Astrophysics local model for Relativistic Reflection 

Copyright 2022 Thomas Dauser, Remeis Observatory & ECAP

### 1. General
The model description and download of released version can be found on the homepage at 
http://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/research/relxill/  -- In order to obtain a stable version this
is the best place to get the model from.

### 2. Installation
In order to install and build the model from the GIT distribution, simply run "make model". 
It will be installed in the subdirectory "build/". After the installation, a simple test is executed. If
this test succeed the model should be correctly working. This installation only works if you have a recent
version of Heasoft installed (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/).

### 3. Usage
The relxill code is written in C and C++. While its routines can be used directly, its main intention
is to be used as *local model* in X-ray data analysis software such as ISIS, Xspec, or Sherpa. The 
description and meaning of the model parameters can be found in the relxill documentation (https://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/~dauser/research/relxill/relxill_docu.pdf)
and on the relxill homepage.
If the default installation does not work for you, you might need to check how to install local models for your
data analysis software.
