# autobox
Prototype of an autoboxing routine for tclean
 
 This routine is designed to automatically mask (or "box") real emission as an interferometer image is being cleaned. The goal is to replicate the masking an expert imager would produce. The algorithm is being development primarily for use with ALMA data, but appears to be generally applicable.
