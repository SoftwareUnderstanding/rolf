# MST: Adopted Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm for identifying filaments
Automatically identificantion of filamentary clouds has long been a difficulty. This code is adopted from minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm to settle this problem. It isolates coherent filaments through position-position-velocity (PPV) catalogue. An MST connects all the nodes (sources from PPV catalogue) in a graph with the cost of a minimum sum of edges (separations of each two sources) and the accepted MST should satisfy: (1) Contain at least a certain number of  sources; (2)  Only edges shorter than a maximum length can be connected; (3) For any two sources to be connected, the difference in line-of-sight velocity (âˆ†v) must be less than  a cretain value. If no velocity information is given, the code will identify filaments in position-position (PP) space.

## Usage
* Untar *MST.tar.gz* and enter the folder *MST*.
* Run *MST.ipypy* to get velocity coherent manimum spanning trees. Before running, several parameters should be set:

    (1)'my_dL', the maximum distance between two nodes to be connected;

   (2)'my_dV', the maximum velocity difference between two nodes to be connected. If you have no velocity information, please set 'my_dV' to -1;

   (3)'filename', the path of your data table. Each line of the table is the PPV information of a node to connect, containing its two-dimensional position and velocity in sequence. An example is *lbv.dat*, recording Galactic longitude, Galactic latitude and velocity of [ATLASGAL clumps](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/473/1/1059/4107114). If you do not have velocity information, please give a table only consisting of two-dimensional position and set 'my_dV' to -1. An example is *lv.dat*, conntaining only Galactic longitude and Galactic latitude;
 
   (4)'l1,l2', x range to identify filaments. For instance, if your data have Galactic longitude range from 0 to 60 deg. But you only want to inspect filaments from 10 to 15 deg, you can set 'l1,l2' to 10, 15.
* The output of the code are lists that consist of connectivity of nodes in each filament and a figure showing that. In *branch_list.dat*, each list represents a filament and integers are ids for nodes (if you give 100 nodes, the ids for them will be from 0 to 99 in order). The inner lists with two ids mean that these two nodes are connected.
* Two demo figures that show the MSTs are generated in the folder *fig*. The image *demo_lbv.png* is the output of the code with current parameters. *demo_lb.png* is the output when changing 'my_dV' to -1 and filename to 'lb.dat'.
