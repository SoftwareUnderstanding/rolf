W≈çtan...
====================

...offers free and open source algorithms to automagically remove trends from time-series data.

> In Germanic mythology, Odin (/ÀàoÀê√∞inÀê/ Old High German: W≈çtan) is a widely revered god. He gave one of his eyes to Mimir in return for wisdom. Thus, in order to achieve a goal, one sometimes has to turn a blind eye. In Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen", Wotan is the King of the Gods (god of light, air, and wind) and a bass-baritone. According to Wagner, he is the "pinnacle of intelligence".

Example usage
-------------
```
from wotan import flatten
flatten_lc, trend_lc = flatten(time, flux, window_length=0.5, method='biweight', return_trend=True)
```

Available features
-------------------

- ``window_length`` The length of the filter window in units of ``time`` (usually days).
- ``break_tolerance`` If there are large gaps in time, especially with corresponding flux level offsets, the detrending is much improved when splitting the data into several sub-lightcurves and applying the filter to each individually. Comes with an empirical default and is fully adjustable.
- ``edge_cutoff`` Trends near edges are less robust. Depending on the data, it may be beneficial to remove edges.
- ``cval`` Tuning parameter for the robust estimators (see [documentation](https://wotan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html))
- ``return_trend`` If `True`, the method will return a tuple of two elements (``flattened_flux``, ``trend_flux``) where ``trend_flux`` is the removed trend. Otherwise, it will only return ``flattened_flux``.
- ``transit_mask`` Mask known transits during detrending [(üìëExample)](https://github.com/hippke/wotan/blob/master/examples/transit%20mask.ipynb)


What method to choose?
-----------------------
It depends on your data and what you like to achieve ([relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2048/)). If possible, try it out! Use wotan with a selection of methods, iterate over their parameter space, and choose what gives the best results for your research.

If that is too much effort, you should first examine your data.
- Is it mostly white (Gaussian) noise? Use a time-windowed sliding mean. This is the most efficient method for white noise.
- With prominent outliers (such as transits or flares), use a robust time-windowed method such as the ``biweight``. This is usually superior to the ``median`` or trimmed methods.
- Are there (semi-) periodic trends? In addition to a time-windowed biweight, try a spline-based method. Experimenting with periodic GPs is worthwhile.


Installation
------------
To install the released version, type

    $ pip install wotan

which automatically installs `numpy`, `numba` and ``scipy`` if not present. Depending on the algorithm, additional dependencies exist:

- `huber`, `ramsay`, and `hampel` depend on `statsmodels`
- `hspline` and `gp` depend on `sklearn`
- `pspline` depends on `pygam`
- `supersmoother` depends on `supersmoother`

To install all additional dependencies, type ``$ pip install statsmodels sklearn supersmoother pygam``.


Originality
----------------
As all scientific work, w≈çtan is [*standing on the shoulders of giants*](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton). Particularly, many detrending methods are wrapped from existing packages. Original contributions include:
- A time-windowed detrending master module with edge treatments and segmentation options
- Robust location estimates using Newton-Raphson iteration to a precision threshold for Tukey's biweight, Andrew's sine wave, and the Welsch-Leclerc. This is probably a "first", which reduces jitter in the location estimate by ~10 ppm
- Robustified (iterative sigma-clipping) penalized splines for automatic knot distance determination and outlier resistance
- Robustified (iterative sigma-clipping) Gaussian processes
- GP with a periodic kernel informed by a Lomb-Scargle periodogram pre-search
- Bringing together many methods in one place in a common interface, with sensible defaults
- Providing documentation, tutorials, and a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00966) which compares and benchmarks the methods
