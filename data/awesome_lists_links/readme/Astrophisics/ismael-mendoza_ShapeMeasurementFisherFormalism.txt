Software for Shape Measurement Fisher Formalism Studies
============================================

Software to study Fisher Formalism predictions on galaxy weak lensing for LSST [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org).

This software can predictions for one or two galaxies simulated from [galsim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim). 

This software (tagged [v1.0.1](https://github.com/ismael-mendoza/ShapeMeasurementFisherFormalism/releases/tag/v1.0.1)) was used to produce the figures in the upcoming paper titled "Effects of Overlapping Sources on Cosmic Shear Estimation: Statistical Sensitivity and Pixel-Noise Bias", 
information about this project can be found in the confluence page [here](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Effects+of+Overlapping+Sources+on+Cosmic+Shear+Estimation%3A+Statistical+Sensitivity+and+Pixel-Noise+Bias).
The figures for this paper produced using the software can be found in `notebooks/Paper-plots.ipynb` 

This work was conducted by Ismael Mendoza, in collaboration with Pat Burchat and Josh Meyers, at Stanford University in 2015-2017. 
Work was supported by the National Science Foundation and by LSST.
