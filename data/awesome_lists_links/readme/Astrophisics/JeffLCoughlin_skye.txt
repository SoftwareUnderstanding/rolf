# The Skye Test

This code was used to detect a statistically significant excess clustering of trasit times, indicating that there are likely systematics at specific times that cause many false positive detections, for the Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog. The technique could be used for any survey looking to statistically cull false alarms.

The code is provided here in case anyone finds it useful, but the input files are several hundred MB each (compressed). Contact me if you think you really need them and will find useful. I have uploaded the PDF plots that show how the technique works graphically. See section A.3.7.4. of Thompson et al. 2017/2018 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171006758T) for a detailed description of Skye.
