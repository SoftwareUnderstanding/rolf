This code provides a framework for reducing spectroscopic observations taken by the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The Python-code wraps recipes developed by the European Southern Observatory and runs the full X-shooter data reduction pipeline. The code offers full flexibility in terms of what data reduction recipes to include, and which calibration files to use. During the data reduction chain restart-files are saved, which makes it possible to restart at any step in the chain.
