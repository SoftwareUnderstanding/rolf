Python scripts to derive physical properties (linewidth, temperature, column density, etc.) using Ammonia hyperfine lines.

There are three version for now:

	nh3_trot_v0.2_singlev.py - To go through a datacube and derive maps, assuming there is only one velocity.

	pyamor_v0.4.py			 - To go through a datacube too, but there could be two velocity components.

	ave_spec_g2853.py		 - To fit a single spectrum. Optimized for G28.53 for now.
