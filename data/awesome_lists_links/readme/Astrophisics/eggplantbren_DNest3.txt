Welcome to DNest3
=================

**IMPORTANT**
DNest3 is no longer supported.
Please see [DNest4](http://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest4)

DNest3 is a free software
C++ implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian Inference and Statistical Mechanics.

Relative to older DNest versions, DNest3 has improved performance
(in terms of the sampling overhead, likelihood evaluations still dominate in
general) and is cleaner code: implementing new models should be easier than it
was before. In addition, DNest3 is multi-threaded, so you can run multiple
MCMC walkers at the same time, and the results will be combined together.

For documentation (currently in a draft state),
please compile the LaTeX manual in the doc directory.

The Paper
=========

Before you use DNest3, you might want to read the paper describing the
Diffusive Nested Sampling algorithm. If you find this software useful in your
own work, please also feel free to cite this paper.

Diffusive Nested Sampling
Brendon J. Brewer, Livia B. Pártay, and Gábor Csányi
Statistics and Computing, 2011, 21, 4, 649-656.

The paper is [freely available online](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380) at
the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org/).

Dependencies
============

DNest3 requires that you have the following packages installed on your
computer. The first two will be required to compile the C++ part of DNest3
which is responsible for the MCMC runs themselves.

* [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)

These extra packages will be needed to execute the postprocessing
and plotting code, which is written in Python.

* [Python 2](http://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

Mac
---

If you're using a Mac, hopefully you're also using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or
[Macports](https://www.macports.org/). Please do it.

Now that we've got that out of the way, install the dependencies:

```
brew install cmake gsl boost
```

or

```
sudo port install cmake gsl boost
```

Ubuntu
------

Install the dependencies as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib
sudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

Building
========

You can build DNest3 using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/):

```
git clone https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3.git
mkdir DNest3/build
cd DNest3/build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

<!--Then please copy postprocess.py to somewhere in your PYTHONPATH, or add the-->
<!--DNest3 directory to your PYTHONPATH.-->

This will install the DNest3 library and header files into `/usr/local`, while
example programs are available in `DNest3/Examples`.  If required,
change the installation location by giving a `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option
to CMake:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp ..
```

Other useful options include:

* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug`

  Turn off optimization and include debugging symbols: the resulting code will
  be much slower.

* `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=true`

  Build `libdnest3` as a shared library.

* `-DBUILD_MANUAL=true`

  Build a PDF manual in `DNest3/doc`. Requires pdfLaTeX.
