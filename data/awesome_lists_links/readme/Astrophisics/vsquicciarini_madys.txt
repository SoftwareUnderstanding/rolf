Manifold Age Determination for Young Stars (MADYS) 
==========

Description
-----------
This repository includes the first version of `MADYS`: the Manifold Age Determination for Young Stars, a flexible Python tool for age and mass determination of young stellar and substellar objects.

`MADYS` automatically retrieves and cross-matches photometry from several catalogs, estimates interstellar extinction, and derives age and mass estimates for individual objects through isochronal fitting.

Harmonising the heterogeneity of publicly-available isochrone grids, the tool allows to choose amongst several models, many of which with customisable astrophysical parameters. Particular attention has been dedicated to the categorization of these models, labeled through a four-level taxonomical classification.

At the moment of writing, MADYS includes 17 models, more than 120 isochrone grids, and more then 200 photometric filters (a thorough description each of them is provided). However, despite our efforts, the model list is far from being complete. If you wish a new model to be included in a new version of `MADYS`, or a new set of photometric filters to be added to the current list, feel free to get in contact with us.

Finally, several dedicated plotting functions are included to allow a visual perception of the numerical output.

Latest news:
------------
Aug 03, 2022 - Sloan Digital Sky Survey added to the list of automatically searchable surveys. Its filters are now available with the following models: PARSEC, MIST, AMES-Dusty, AMES-Cond, BT-Settl, NextGen.

Jun 20, 2022 - BEX models (Linder et al. 2019, Marleau et al. 2019) added to the list of available models.

Jun 17, 2022 - Gaia DR3 now available! The new catalog replaces, for all intents and purposes, Gaia EDR3.


Installation:
------------
Catalog queries are mediated by the [TAP Gaia Query](https://github.com/mfouesneau/tap) package (tap). If you import madys from the command line, the module is automatically installed if not found. However, **this does not work from Jupyter Notebook**. We suggest to manually install the package from pip, through:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/mfouesneau/tap
```
Please make sure you use the command above, as just using `pip install tap` will download **a different**, although eponymous, package. 

Note that TAP Gaia Query might require the installation of [lxml](https://lxml.de/) (v4.6.3).

Once TAP Gaia Query is installed, the current `MADYS` repository can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install madys
```
Note that, when using for the first time an extinction map, `MADYS` will download the relevant file (0.7 GB or 2.2 GB, depending on the map).


Requirements
------------

This package relies on usual packages for data science and astronomy: [numpy](https://numpy.org/) (v1.18.1), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) (v1.6.1), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (v1.1.4), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (v3.3.4), [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) (v4.3.1) and [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) (v3.2.1).

In addition, it also requires [astroquery](https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/) (v0.4.2.dev0) and [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) (v0.8.9).

It also requires [TAP Gaia Query](https://github.com/mbonav/tapGaia) (v0.1). The last package might require the installation of [lxml](https://lxml.de/) (v4.6.3).


Examples
--------

The package is fully documented and a detailed description of its features, together with several examples of the kind of scientific results that can be obtained with it, is provided in [Squicciarini & Bonavita 2022 arXiv:2206.02446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02446).

However, we recommend you check out the [examples](https://github.com/vsquicciarini/madys/blob/main/examples/) provided, for a better understanding of its usage.

If you find a bug or want to suggest improvements, please create a [ticket](https://github.com/vsquicciarini/madys/issues).
