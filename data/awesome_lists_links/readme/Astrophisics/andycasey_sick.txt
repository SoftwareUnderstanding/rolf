*sick*, the spectroscopic inference crank

``sick`` is a generalised package for inferring astrophysical parameters from noisy observed spectra. Phenomena that can alter the data (e.g., redshift, continuum, instrumental broadening, outlier pixels) are modelled and simultaneously inferred with the astrophysical parameters of interest. This package is best-suited for situations where a grid of model spectra already exists, and you would like to infer model parameters given some data.

Installation
------------
You can install ``sick`` and all of its dependencies with the following one-liner:

``pip install sick --user``

(Or, [if you must](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install), you can use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``)
