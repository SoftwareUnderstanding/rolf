## GENERAL NOTES

For the underlying physics we refer to the paper [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-1706.02249-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02249).

- DaMaSCUS is a MC simulator of dark matter particles as they move through the Earth and scatter on terrestrial nuclei. 
- It allows to compute the local distortions of the DM phase space caused by collisions with nuclei. 
- The thusly distorted distribution functions and densities are used to give precise estimates of time-dependent signal rates for direct detection experiments and diurnal modulations.
- A full, realistic model of the Earth is implemented as well as the Earth's time-dependent velocity and orientation in the galactic frame.
- DaMaSCUS is written in C++ and fully parallelized (openMPI).

## INSTALLATION AND USAGE

For installation and usage we refer to the [documentation](http://damascus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
