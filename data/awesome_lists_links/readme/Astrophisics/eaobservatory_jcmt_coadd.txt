## JCMT COADD

A tool for reducing UKT14 continuum and photometry data from the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope.

For details on UKT14: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990MNRAS.243..126D

The MT/UN/144 JCMT document was written for the VAX version but provides
a good introduction to the Unix port.

Requires a copy of the PGPLOT library for graphics and the GSD library
to be able to read in raw JCMT data. Both these libraries can be
obtained from the Starlink distribution (https://github.com/Starlink/starlink).

JCMT/UKIRT Newsletter #5, p32, from 1993 contains a detailed overview of the
software.
