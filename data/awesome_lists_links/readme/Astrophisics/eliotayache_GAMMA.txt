# GAMMA

GAMMA is a code for modeling relativistic hydrodynamics and non-thermal emission on a moving mesh.

Parts of the code are currently still under development. A full documentation will be made available shortly.
For now we provide information on how to compile and run the test cases included with the code.

## Requirements

- gnu scientific library
- OpenMP
- MPI

## Installation

Clone this repository in a directory of your choice. Move to the directory and build the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eliotayache/GAMMA/ dirname
cd dirname
make -B
```

## Usage

### running a simulation

Output is stored in ./results/Last. Before you can run calculations you need to create this directory.

```bash
mkdir -p results/Last
```

Use mpirun to launch computation on `N_nodes` nodes. The code automatically uses all cores available.

```bash
mpirun -n N_nodes ./bin/GAMMA -w  # to overwrite files in results/Last
mpirun -n N_nodes ./bin/GAMMA -r  # to resume from the last file in results/Last
```

### choice of module to use

The choice of geometry, time-integration, solver, dimensions are specified in ./Makefile
```Makefile
INITIAL    = Tests/BM1D      # Initial setup: .cpp file in src/Initial (see test examples)
TIMESTEP   = rk3             # euler / rk3
GEOMETRY   = spherical1D     # cartesian / spherical / spherical1D
HYDRO      = rel_sph         # rel_cart / rel_sph
RADIATION  = radiation_sph   # only one option for now
SOLVER     = hllc            # only one option for now
DIMENSIONS = 1d              # 1d / 2d
IO         = text1d          # text1d / text2d
```

### environment variables

A range of self-explanatory environement variables are specified in src/environment.h and should be set before running the code. The non-thermal particle population calculation switches are the following.
```Makefile
#define SHOCK_DETECTION_        ENABLED_
#define DETECT_SHOCK_THRESHOLD_ 0.01
#define LOCAL_SYNCHROTRON_      ENABLED_      # needs SHOCK_DETECTION_ ENABLED_
#define GAMMA_MAX_INIT_         (1.e8)
#define VARIABLE_PSPEC_         DISABLED_     # needs LOCAL_SYNCHROTRON_ and SHOCK_DETECTION_ ENABLED_
```

### initial setup

New initial setups can be created as new .cpp files in src/Initial. 
**These files should follow the same architecture as the example tests in src/Initial/Tests.** They specify the initial grid geometry, the initial fluid values, the output times, the AMR criteria and other user-specified (override) functions.

The geometry and fluid state are initialised on a grid `Cinit`. After initialisation the calculation will be moved to the `Ctot`grid that includes ghost cells. The relevant indices to move around the various grids involved in the code are all specified in `src/grid.h`  
In `initialValues()` the fluid state should be specified in terms of primitive variables `S.prim[q]` with velocities in units of c.

The following functions have to be declared in this initial file:
```c++
void loadParams(s_par *par){}
int Grid::initialGeometry(){return(0);}
int Grid::initialValues(){return(0);}
void Grid::userKinematics(){}
void Cell::userSourceTerms(double dt){}
void Grid::userBoundaries(int it, double t){}
int Grid::checkCellForRegrid(int j, int i){return(skip_);}
void Cell::user_regridVal(double *res){}
void FluidState::cons2prim_user(double *rho, double *p, double *uu){}
void Simu::dataDump(){}
void Simu::runInfo(){}
void Simu::evalEnd(){}

```

### output visualisation

Python plotting functions are available in `/bin/Tools/plotting_scripts.py`. These functions should be run from this directory.
