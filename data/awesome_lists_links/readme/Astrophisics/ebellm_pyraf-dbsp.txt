## PYRAF-DBSP
*A PyRAF-based reduction pipeline for spectra taken with the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph.*

This pipeline provides a simplified interface for basic reduction of single-object spectra with minimal overhead.  It is suitable for quicklook classification of transients as well as moderate-precision (few km/s) radial velocity work.

Tested with IRAF 2.16.1, PyRAF 2.1.6.
