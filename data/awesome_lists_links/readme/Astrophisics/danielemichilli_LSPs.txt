This software has been specifically designed for the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS). It has not been developed with the idea to be used in other projects. Therefore, it is very poorly documented and heavily system-dependent. A more basic code, lacking some of the functionalities but designed with the idea to be shared, is available at https://github.com/danielemichilli/SpS
