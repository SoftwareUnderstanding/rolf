JSPAM
=====

Software for simulating interacting galaxies using a restricted three-body approximation.

The current version of the code is available in the various language sub directories.  A portion of the historic version of the code is available in the archive directory.  The archive directory includes instructions for running a script that will recreate all 62 best-fit models from the Galaxy Zoo: Mergers project.  The js directory contains a web page that can run the same models in your browser.

The current language implementations include:

1. Fortran
2. Java
3. JavaScript
4. Python
