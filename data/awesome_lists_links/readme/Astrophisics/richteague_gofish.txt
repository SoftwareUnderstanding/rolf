### Installation

The quickest way to install is using PyPI:

`> pip install gofish`

which will install all the necessary dependancies.

### Example Usage

For a thorough introduction on how to use `GoFish`, see the extensive [documentation](https://fishing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

In brief, the user will attach an image cube to `GoFish` which will read the necessary header information:

```python
# Attach an image cube.
from gofish import imagecube
cube = imagecube('path/to/cube.fits')
```

Once attached, you can extract the average spectrum over a user-specified region using the known geometrical properties of the disk and priors about the velocity profile of the disk:

```python
# Return the averaged spectrum between 0.0" and 1.0".
x, y, dy = cube.average_spectrum(r_min=0.0, r_max=1.0, inc=5.0,
                                 PA=152., mstar=0.88, dist=59.5)
```

where `x` is the velocity axis, `y` is the spectrum and `dy` is the uncertainty. Alternatively the integrated spectrum can be extracted in a similar manner,

```python
# Return the integrated spectrum between 0.0" and 1.0".
x, y, dy = cube.integrated_spectrum(r_min=0.0, r_max=1.0, inc=5.0,
                                    PA=152., mstar=0.88, dist=59.5)
```

where `y` is now the integrated flux in units of Jy.
