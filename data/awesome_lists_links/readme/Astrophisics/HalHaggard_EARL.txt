Exoplanet Analytic Reflected Lightcurves (EARL): This Mathematica notebook allows you to compute the analytic form of a reflected lightcurve given a spherical harmonic decomposition of the planet albedo map and the viewing and orbital geometries. The theoretical foundation for this code is laid out in the paper "Analytic Reflected Lightcurves for Exoplanets" by Hal M. Haggard and Nicolas B. Cowan, which can be found on the arXiv.
