# RT1D
A 1D Model for Rayleigh-Taylor Instability

Author: Paul Duffell

This code is parallel, and uses mpich2.  The code should compile so long as "mpicc" works.  Just type "make".

If you don't have MPI, it is straightforward to get.  Look for "mpich2" using macports or homebrew.

The license for this code is GPL.  The GPL license should be contained in this directory.

Please cite me if you use this work.  In particular, cite my paper, Duffell (2016):

One more thing: I posted this code because I believe in transparency in science, not because I am advertising this code or attempting to promote its extensive use.  I am happy to answer the occasional question, but I hope that you will attempt to solve most issues on your own.
