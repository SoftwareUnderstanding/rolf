#DustCharge functions.

To Do:
 - Add a note to download the tables by Draine.
 - Include cosmic ray currents in the calculations of zeq.
 - Clean up and add comments to the various functions.

Done:
 - Include CR currents in calculation of new_zmin, new_zmax. (September 2018)
 - Update the use of fH2shield to the column density. If I'm processing a Flash simulation I should do this calculation beforehand.
