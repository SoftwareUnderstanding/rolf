# NAPLES
NAPLES is a Fortran code for the Numerical Analysis of PLanetary EncounterS.

This code was used to perform the ensemble propagations in the reference:

Amato D., Ba√π G., and Bombardelli C., "Accurate numerical orbit propagation of planetary close encounters". Submitted to MNRAS. 2016.

This reference also contains more details on the logic underlying the present code.
Please check out the wiki pages for some information on the basic operation of the code.

The code has been compiled and tested on an Intel i7 machine, running Linux Mint 17.3, with the gfortran compiler (gcc version 4.8.4).
