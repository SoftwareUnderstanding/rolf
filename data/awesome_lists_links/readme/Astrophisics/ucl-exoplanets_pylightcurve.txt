# Updates in version 4.0

#### Deprecation notice

PyLightcurve 4.0 no longer supports the use of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue (OEC), due to the large number 
of mistakes in the catalogue and the absence of parameters updates. OEC has been replaced by the 
Exoplanet Characterisation Catalogue, dedicated to transiting exoplanets. This catalogue does not contain all the 
exoplanets at the moment but will be continuously updated with more planets.

#### Multi-epoch and multi-color data fitting

Version 4.0 brings a new easy way of simultaneously fitting light curves from different 
sources (different flux and time formats, different exposure times), different filters
(multi-colour) and different epochs (multi-epoch). 

#### Eclipse model and eclipse data fitting

We now have the option of modeling eclipse data (finally!) and also tools to calculate the 
eclipse mid-time, eclipse depth and eclipse duration, based of the orbital characteristics 
of the planet. 

#### Limb-darkening coefficients

In this version, the default limb-darkening coefficients are calculated using the new 
package [ExoTETHyS](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS). This allows the 
calculation of the limb-darkening coefficients even for stars cooler than 3500 K. 

#### Angles and times

PyLighrcurve 4.0 includes flexible objects for converting different expressions of 
angles (e.g. '+47:12:34.05' to degrees) and of timing systems (e.g. HJD_UTC to BJD_TDB).

# Usage

## Exoplanets - using the plc.Planet object

In Pylightcurve 4.0.0 we can access all the old and new calculations related to 
exoplanets through the newly introduced plc.Planet object. These calculation aare:
- limb-darkening coefficients
- transit model
- transit data fitting
- transit duration
- transit depth
- planet-to-star flux ratio
- eclipse time
- eclipse model
- eclipse data fitting
- eclipse duration
- eclipse depth
- exoplanet orbital position
- planet-star projected distance

We start by importing Pylightcurve, together with Numpy and Matplotib.

```python
import pylightcurve as plc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

We can then define a plc.Planet object for our favorite exoplanet, HD 209458 b.

```python
planet = plc.Planet(
    name='HD209458b', 
    
    ra = 330.795,                  # float values are assumed to be in degrees,
                                   # alternatively, you can provide a plc.Hours or plc.Degrees object
                                   # here it would be plc.Hours('22:03:10.7729')
    
    dec = 18.884,                  # float values are assumed to be in degrees,
                                   # alternatively, you can provide a plc.Hours or plc.Degrees object
                                   # here it would be plc.Degrees('+18:53:03.548')
    
    stellar_logg = 4.36,           # float, in log(cm/s^2)
    
    stellar_temperature = 6065.0,  # float, in Kelvin
    
    stellar_metallicity = 0.0,     # float, in dex(Fe/H) or dex(M/H)
    
    rp_over_rs = 0.12086,          # float, no units
    
    period = 3.5247486,            # float, in days
    
    sma_over_rs = 8.76,            # float, no units
    
    eccentricity = 0.0,            # float, no units
    
    inclination = 86.71,           # float values are assumed to be in degrees,
                                   # alternatively, you can provide a plc.Hours or plc.Degrees object
                                   # here it would be plc.Degrees(86.71)           
    
    periastron = 0.0,              # float values are assumed to be in degrees,
                                   # alternatively, you can provide a plc.Hours or plc.Degrees object
                                   # here it would be plc.Degrees(0.0)
    
    mid_time = 2452826.62928,      # float, in days
    
    mid_time_format = 'BJD_TDB',   # str, available formats are JD_UTC, MJD_UTC, HJD_UTC, HJD_TDB, BJD_UTC, BJD_TDB    
    
    ldc_method = 'claret',         # str, default = claret, the other methods are: linear, quad, sqrt
    
    ldc_stellar_model = 'phoenix', # str, default = phoenix, the other model is atlas
    
    albedo = 0.15,                 # float, default = 0.15, no units 
    
    emissivity = 1.0,              # float, default = 1.0, no units
)
```

We can quickly create a plc.Planet object based on catalague data as follows: 

```python
planet = plc.get_planet('hd209458b')
```

At the moment the data provided are base on the Exoplanet Characterisation Catalogue (ECC) developed as part of the 
ExoClock Project. The catalogue contains 370 objects and will gradually expand in future releases.

To retrieve a list of all the available planet names we can type:

```python
all_planets = plc.get_all_planets()
```


### Filters

There is a number of parameters for every planet that do depend on the observing filter
and are necessary to calculate the correct transit/eclipse models at different 
wavelengths and to allow the simultaneous analysis of multi-wavelength light-curves:
- the planet-to-star radius ratio (rp_over_rs)
- the limb-darkening coefficients (limb_darkening_coefficients)
- the planet-to-star flux ratio (fp_over_fs)

By default, a plc.Planet object contains the above parameters for a number of standard 
filters:
- clear
- luminance
- JOHNSON_U 
- JOHNSON_B 
- JOHNSON_V 
- COUSINS_R 
- COUSINS_I
- 2mass_j 
- 2mass_h
- 2mass_ks
- sdss_u 
- sdss_g 
- sdss_r 
- sdss_i
- sdss_z
- Kepler 
- TESS
- irac1 (available only for the atlas model, if phoenix is chosen, it will change 
    automatically to atlas, with more restrictions on the minimum temperature 
        available, 3500K)
- irac2 (available only for the atlas model, if phoenix is chosen, it will change 
    automatically to atlas, with more restrictions on the minimum temperature 
        available, 3500K)
- irac3 (available only for the atlas model, if phoenix is chosen, it will change 
    automatically to atlas, with more restrictions on the minimum temperature 
        available, 3500K)
- irac4 (available only for the atlas model, if phoenix is chosen, it will change 
    automatically to atlas, with more restrictions on the minimum temperature 
        available, 3500K)

In these default calculations:
- the rp_over_rs is equal to the value defined when creating the plc.Planet object,
- the limb-darkening coefficients are calculated using the filter response curves, together 
    with the stellar parameters, the ldc_method and the the ldc_stellar_model defined when 
    creating the plc.Planet object (more in the [ExoTETHyS](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS) package),
- the planet-to-star flux ratio (reflected + emmitted) is calculated using the albedo and 
    the emissivity defined when creating the plc.Planet object, assuming the star are 
    emitting as black bodies.

The default calculations can be accessed by typing:
```python
limb_darkening_coefficients = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').limb_darkening_coefficients
fp_over_fs = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').fp_over_fs
rp_over_rs = planet.filter('COUSINS_R').rp_over_rs # no difference from planet.rp_over_rs if we have not defined our own filter
```

Of course we can define additional filters (that can be accessed in the same way) or alter 
the parameters in the existing filters by typing:

```python
planet.add_filter('my_filter', rp_over_rs, ldc1, ldc2, ldc3, ldc4, fp_over_fs)
```

### Fitting Transit / Eclipse light-curves

For the purpose of this excersise, we will create some simulated data. In real life, you will 
provide your own light-curves with their characteristics. 

To model-fit observations, we first need to add them to the plc.Planet object. We should 
be careful to add either only transit data or only eclipse data.

```python

# first observation
time = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.1, planet.mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)

transit = planet.transit_integrated(time, time_format='BJD_TDB', exp_time=120, time_stamp = 'mid', filter_name='COUSINS_R', max_sub_exp_time=1)
systematics = 1.2 * (1 + 0.013 * (time - time[0]) + 0.03 * ((time - time[0]) ** 2))
error = np.random.normal(0, 0.002, len(time))
flux = transit * systematics + error

flux_unc = np.ones_like(error) * np.std(error)

planet.add_observation(
    time = time,                # the time vector of our observation
                                # np.array of float values 
    
    time_format = 'BJD_TDB',    # format in which our time vector is expressed
                                # str, available formats are: JD_UTC, MJD_UTC, HJD_UTC, HJD_TDB, BJD_UTC, BJD_TDB 

    exp_time = 120,             # exposure time of our time vector
                                # float, in seconds
        
    time_stamp = 'mid',         # exposure time stamp for our time vector (do the numbers refer to the exposure start, the mid-exposure, or the exposure end?)
                                # str, available stamps are: start, mid, end 
    
    flux = flux,                # the flux vector of our observation
                                # np.array of float values, 
    
    flux_unc = flux_unc,        # the flux-uncertainty vector of our observation
                                # np.array of float values, 
    
    flux_format = 'flux',       # format in which our flux and flux-uncertainty vectors are expressed
                                # str, available formats are: flux, mag
    
    filter_name = 'COUSINS_R'   # filter used for this observation 
                                # str, available filters are: all the default filters and those added manually by us
)

# second observation
time = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.05, planet.mid_time + 0.15, 0.001)

transit = planet.transit_integrated(time, time_format='HJD_UTC', exp_time=30, time_stamp = 'mid', filter_name='TESS', max_sub_exp_time=1)
systematics = 3.6 * (1 - 0.02 * (time - time[0]) + 0.05 * ((time - time[0]) ** 2))
error = np.random.normal(0, 0.0005, len(time))
flux = transit * systematics + error

flux_unc = np.ones_like(error) * np.std(error)

planet.add_observation(
    time = time,                                         
    time_format = 'HJD_UTC',                                                              
    exp_time = 30,
    time_stamp = 'mid',                                  
    flux = flux,                                   
    flux_unc = flux_unc,                         
    flux_format = 'flux',                       
    filter_name = 'TESS'                   
)
```

Once added, we can fit all the observations simultaneously using the following command:

```python
planet.transit_fitting(output_folder)
```

where the output_folder is the path where we want to save the results. There is a number of options 
when fitting the data:

```python

For eclipse observations, we need to type:

```python
planet.eclipse_fitting(output_folder)
```

and the fitting options are very similar:


```python

### Models of Transits / Eclipses light-curves

Getting the forward model of a transit/eclipse light-curve is as easy as it used to be.

For a specific time series (let's call it time_array with size N), defined in 
any of the acceptable time formats (JD_UTC, MJD_UTC, HJD_UTC, HJD_TDB, BJD_UTC, BJD_TDB) 
we can calculate the transit/eclipse model or the integrated transit/eclipse model for a 
given exposure time and time stamp (start, mid, end, representing the tart the middle and 
the end of the exposure, respectively) as follows:

```python
time_array = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.1, planet.mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)
transit_model = planet.transit(time_array, time_format='BJD_TDB', filter_name='COUSINS_R')
transit_model_integrated = planet.transit_integrated(time_array, time_format='BJD_TDB', 
                                                     exp_time=120, time_stamp='mid',
                                                     filter_name='COUSINS_R')

time_array = np.arange(planet.eclipse_mid_time - 0.1, planet.eclipse_mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)
eclipse_model = planet.eclipse(time_array, time_format='BJD_TDB', filter_name='COUSINS_R')
eclipse_model_integrated = planet.eclipse_integrated(time_array, time_format='BJD_TDB',
                                                     exp_time=120, time_stamp='mid',
                                                     filter_name='COUSINS_R')
```

For the integrated models, the calculation is done on a sub-exposure basis. The code calculates
the model values for a number of shorter exposures, which are then averaged. The length of the 
sub-exposures can be controlled through the max_sub_exp_time argument, for which the default 
value is 10 (in seconds). The lower the number, the more precise the integrated model will be, 
but the computation time will be increased. For all exoplanets, a max_sub_exp_time=10 should be
sufficient.

### Other Transit / Eclipse calculations

Based on the parameters defined when creating the plc.Planet object, the eclipse mid-time
(in the BJD_TDB format) is calculated automatically and we can access it by typing:

```python
eclipse_mid_time = planet.eclipse_mid_time
```

Also, we can calculate the transit/eclipse depth and duration for different filters:

```python
transit_duration = planet.transit_duration('COUSINS_R')
transit_depth = planet.transit_depth('COUSINS_R')
eclipse_duration = planet.eclipse_duration('COUSINS_R')
eclipse_depth = planet.eclipse_depth('COUSINS_R')
```

### Orbital calculations

For a specific time series (let's call it time_array with size N), we can calculate 
other series, related to the orbit of the planet. These are:

1. the 3D position of the planet as a function of time. The planet.planet_orbit function 
will return a 3xN array where the elements corresponds to the x,y,z coordinates of the 
planet. The coordinate system assumes that the star is at (x,y,z)=(0,0,0), the Earth is 
at (x,y,z) = (+inf,0,0) and that the planet is at its periastron during the mid-transit 
time when periastron = 90 degrees. All coordinates are in units of stellar radii.

2. the projected distance between the planet and the star as a function of time. The 
planet.planet_star_projected_distance function will return an array of size N. All 
distances are in units of stellar radii.

3. the orbital phase of the planet. The planet.planet_phase function will return an array 
of size N.

```python
time_array = np.arange(planet.mid_time - 0.1, planet.mid_time + 0.1, 0.001)

x, y, z = planet.planet_orbit(time_array, 'BJD_TDB')
projected_distance = planet.planet_star_projected_distance(time_array, 'BJD_TDB')
planet_phase = planet.planet_phase(time_array, 'BJD_TDB')
```

## Data analysis toolkit

### Angles and times

In this version we can easily convert angles to different formats. For example:

```python
ra = plc.Hours('22:03:10.7729')

ra_in_degrees = ra.deg()
ra_in_hours = ra.hours()
ra_in_rad = ra.rad()
ra_in_dms = ra.dms()
ra_in_dms_coordinate = ra.dms_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees
ra_in_hms = ra.hms()
ra_in_degrees_coordinate = ra.deg_coord() # this will give the angle between -90 and 90 degrees
```

To convert between different time systems we need forst to define aa plc.FixtedTarget 
object:

```python
ra = plc.Hours('22:03:10.7729')
dec = plc.Degrees('+18:53:03.548')
target = plc.FixedTarget(ra, dec)

mid_time_in_hjd_utc = 2458485.00380255
mid_time_in_bjd_tdb = target.convert_to_bjd_tdb(mid_time_in_hjd_utc, 'HJD_UTC')
# available formats: JD_UTC, MJD_UTC, HJD_UTC, HJD_TDB, BJD_UTC, BJD_TDB
```
