# tp2vis
Total Power to Visibilities (TP2VIS): an ALMA Cycle 4 Development Study

Jin Koda, Peter Teuben, Adele Plunkett, Tsuyoshi Sawada, Crystal Brogan, Ed Formalont

This project provides tools to create visibilities from a single dish cube using the method of [Koda et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..193...19K) and Koda et al. 2019 (PASP in press).
The TP visibilities can then be combined with the interferometric visibilities in a joint deconvolution using for example CASA's [**tclean()**](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/latest/global-task-list/task_tclean/about) method.
TP2VIS requires **CASA 5.4 or above** and as powerful a computer as what the CASA Feather guide requires.

## Release note

This release assumes that users have experience on interferometer data reduction with CASA so that they can catch any anomaly by themselves. This release is ready for scientific use, but please let us know if you encounter any problem.

The following acknowledgement would be appreciated if you decide to use TP2VIS: "This work made use of TP2VIS (Koda et al. 2011 ApJS, 139, 19; Koda et al. 2019, PASP in press)".


## Download

Click "Clone or download" on [top page](https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute) for download options, or run

       git clone https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute.git

You need only one script "tp2vis.py".

## Usage

To give you a quick idea how to run TP2VIS, here are the basic flow of commands in CASA, broken into 6 pieces. This document gives an overall flow, but look at examples listed below for more info.


### 1. Preparations:

#### 1.1: Make a pointing (**ptg**) file

       listobs('calibrated_12m.ms',listfile='calibrated_12m.log')

after which you can cut and paste the appropriate **Fields**
in the following format into a pointing file, **12m.ptg**, which has to be a simple text file:

       cat 12m.ptg
       
       J2000 05h39m45.660s -70d07m57.524s
       J2000 05h39m54.340s -70d07m57.524s
       J2000 05h39m41.320s -70d07m19.175s
       ...

This can be a little cumbersome, so in the examples listed below you can see examples using awk and grep.

#### 1.2: Find a reasonable RMS

We need to know the RMS in the TP cube from some line free channels. For example, you might be able to use the first 10 channels of your TP cube

       importfits(fitsimage='tp.fits',imagename='tp.im')              # convert to CASA image format
       imstat('tp.im',axes=[0,1])['rms'][:10].mean()
       -> 0.67

#### 1.3: Cutting down the 12m & 7m MS dataset sizes.

Cut down unnecessary spws from measurement sets as tp2vis assumes all spws to be used for imaging.
CASA tasks such as
[**split()**](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/latest/global-task-list/task_split/about)
and
[**mstransform()**](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/latest/global-task-list/task_mstransform/about)
can be useful.


### 2. Load and run TP2VIS:

       execfile('tp2vis.py')                                          # load tp2vis 
       tp2vis('tp.im','tp.ms','12m.ptg',rms=0.67)                     # make visibilities

### 3. [optional] Expert mode Weighting Schemes

       tp2viswt('tp.ms', ...)                                         # set weights
       tp2vispl(['12m.ms','7m.ms','tp.ms'])                           # (optional) plot weights

"tp2viswt" shows weight statistics and manipulates weights. There are several modes how you can set weight, described in [example1](example1.md). "tp2vispl" plots the weights.

### 4. Some CASA workarounds to get files recognized properly

In case tclean crashes in the next step (perhaps due to an inconsistency in CASA versions), there is no single workaround. The below worked in some cases (more in [example1](example1.md), section 4):

       concat(vis=['12m.ms','7m.ms','tp.ms'], concatvis='all.ms',copypointing=False)

The "copypointing=False" option is important. No worries, important pointing info still remain in 'all.ms' (one of CASA mysteries!).

### 5. finally the joint deconvolution using CASA's ``tclean()``

       tclean(vis='all.ms', imagename='all_clean', ...)                     # run clean the way you like it

Where ... represents the large number of options to control the deconvolution. For example, users may try "robust" and "uvtaper" options.

Make dirty images as well

       tclean(vis='all.ms', imagename='all_dirty', niter=0, ...)                     # make dirty map

### 6. Correction for beam size mismatch

This step is for general interferometer imaging, not only for TP2VIS.

Once dirty and cleaned images are generated, one may correct for the discrepancy between dirty and clean/restore beam areas (see [**Jorsater and van Moorsel 1995**](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AJ....110.2037J)).

       tp2vistweak('all_dirty','all_clean')                   # adjust dirty beam size in residual image

It assumes that all outputs from tclean() are kept intact (no name change). It creates ``.tweak.image`` and ``.tweak.residual``, which have a correct flux scale.
