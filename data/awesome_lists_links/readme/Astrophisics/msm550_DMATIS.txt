# DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling)
![DAMIC_visulization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msm550/DMATIS/master/DAMIC_demostration.png)



DMATIS (Dark Matter ATtenuation Importance Sampling) calculates the trajectories of DM particles that propagate in the Earth's crust and the lead shield to reach the DAMIC detector using an importance sampling Monte-Carlo simulation. A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation avoids the deficiencies of the SGED/KS method that uses a mean energy loss description to calculate the lower bound on the DM-proton cross section. This code, thanks to the use of importance sampling technique, makes the Monte-Carlo simulation of SIDMs' energy-loss computationally feasible. DMATIS is written in Python 3 and MATHEMATICA.

## Disclaimer
This code is the priliminary version. It's only have been tested for the regime of interest in [JCAP12(2017)004](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/12/004/meta).
A more advanced code is under development.
