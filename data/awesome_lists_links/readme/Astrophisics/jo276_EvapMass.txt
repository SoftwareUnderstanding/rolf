The uses the photoevaporation driven evolution model of Owen & Wu (2013,2017) to predict the minimum masses of planets in multi-planet systems to be consistent with the photoevaporation model. 

The planetary system requires both a planet above and below the radius gap to be useful for this test. 

There is an example jupyter notebook for the Kepler-36 system.
