# Fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for semantic segmentation with tensorflow.

This is a simple implementation of a fully convolutional neural network (FCN). The net is based on fully convolutional neural net described in the paper [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211.pdf).  The code is based on [FCN implementation](https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow)  by Sarath Shekkizhar with MIT license but replaces the VGG19 encoder with VGG16 encoder. The net is initialized using the pre-trained VGG16 model by Marvin Teichmann.
An improved version of this net in pytorch [is given here](https://github.com/sagieppel/Fully-convolutional-neural-network-FCN-for-semantic-segmentation-with-pytorch)
## This is an old model for a New more accurate version of the net focused on recognition of materials in transparent vessels see this [link](https://github.com/sagieppel/Detecting-and-segmenting-and-classifying-materials-inside-vessels-in-images-using-convolutional-net)

## Details input/output
The input for the net is RGB image (Figure 1 right).
The net produces pixel-wise annotation as a matrix in the size of the image with the value of each pixel corresponding to its class (Figure 1 left).

## Requirements
This network was run with Python 3.6  Anaconda package and Tensorflow 1.1. The training was done using Nvidia GTX 1080, on Linux Ubuntu 16.04.

## Setup
1) Download the code from the repository.
2) Download a pre-trained vgg16 net and put in the /Model_Zoo subfolder in the main code folder. A pre-trained vgg16 net can be download from here[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXZWcwX0FKTGJKRWs/view?usp=sharing] or from here [ftp://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/mttt2/models/vgg16.npy]

## Tutorial

### Instructions for training (in TRAIN.py):
In: TRAIN.py
1) Set folder of the training images in Train_Image_Dir
2) Set folder for the ground truth labels in Train_Label_DIR
3) The Label Maps should be saved as png image with the same name as the corresponding image and png ending
4) Download a pretrained [vgg16](ftp://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/mttt2/models/vgg16.npy) model and put in model_path (should be done automatically if you have internet connection)
5) Set number of classes/labels in NUM_CLASSES
6) If you are interested in using validation set during training, set UseValidationSet=True and the validation image folder to Valid_Image_Dir 
   and set the folder with ground truth labels for the validation set in Valid_Label_Dir

### Instructions for predicting pixelwise annotation using trained net (in Inference.py)
In: Inference.py
1) Make sure you have trained model in logs_dir (See Train.py for creating trained model)
2) Set the Image_Dir to the folder where the input images for prediction are located.
3) Set the number of classes in NUM_CLASSES
4) Set  folder where you want the output annotated images to be saved to Pred_Dir
5) Run script

### Evaluating net performance using intersection over union (IOU):
In: Evaluate_Net_IOU.py
1) Make sure you have trained model in logs_dir (See Train.py for creating trained model)
2) Set the Image_Dir to the folder where the input images for prediction are located
3) Set folder for ground truth labels in Label_DIR. The Label Maps should be saved as png image with the same name as the corresponding image and png ending
4) Set number of classes number in NUM_CLASSES
5) Run script

## Supporting data sets
The net was tested on a dataset of annotated images of materials in glass vessels. 
This dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXRFpmY1pOV1A4SFE/view?usp=sharing)

MIT Scene Parsing Benchmark with over 20k pixel-wise annotated images can also be used for training and can be download from [here](http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/)
