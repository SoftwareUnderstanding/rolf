This project hosts the code for implementing the FCOS algorithm for object detection, as presented in our paper:

    FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection;
    Tian Zhi, Chunhua Shen, Hao Chen, and Tong He;
    arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.01355 (2019).

The full paper is available at: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01355). 

## Highlights
- **Totally anchor-free:**  FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes and all hyper-parameters of anchor boxes.   
- **Memory-efficient:** FCOS uses 2x less training memory footprint than its anchor-based counterpart RetinaNet.
- **Better performance:** The very simple detector achieves better performance (37.1 vs. 36.8) than Faster R-CNN.
- **Faster training and inference:** With the same hardwares, FCOS also requires less training hours (6.5h vs. 8.8h) and faster inference speed (71ms vs. 126 ms per im) than Faster R-CNN.
- **State-of-the-art performance:** Without bells and whistles, FCOS achieves state-of-the-art performances.
It achieves **41.5%** (ResNet-101-FPN) and **43.2%** (ResNeXt-64x4d-101) in AP on coco test-dev.

## Updates
### 17 May 2019
   - FCOS has been implemented in [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Many thanks to [@yhcao6](https://github.com/yhcao6) and [@hellock](https://github.com/hellock).

## Required hardware
We use 8 Nvidia V100 GPUs. \
But 4 1080Ti GPUs can also train a fully-fledged ResNet-50-FPN based FCOS since FCOS is memory-efficient.  

## Installation

This FCOS implementation is based on [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). Therefore the installation is the same as original maskrcnn-benchmark.

Please check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
You may also want to see the original [README.md](MASKRCNN_README.md) of maskrcnn-benchmark.

## A quick demo
Once the installation is done, you can follow the below steps to run a quick demo.
    
    # assume that you are under the root directory of this project,
    # and you have activated your virtual environment if needed.
    wget https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/dDeDPBLEAt19Xrl/download -O FCOS_R_50_FPN_1x.pth
    python demo/fcos_demo.py


## Inference
The inference command line on coco minival split:

    python tools/test_net.py \
        --config-file configs/fcos/fcos_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml \
        MODEL.WEIGHT models/FCOS_R_50_FPN_1x.pth \
        TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 4    

Please note that:
1) If your model's name is different, please replace `models/FCOS_R_50_FPN_1x.pth` with your own.
2) If you enounter out-of-memory error, please try to reduce `TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH` to 1.
3) If you want to evaluate a different model, please change `--config-file` to its config file (in [configs/fcos](configs/fcos)) and `MODEL.WEIGHT` to its weights file.

For your convenience, we provide the following trained models (more models are coming soon).

[1] *1x and 2x mean the model is trained for 90K and 180K iterations, respectively.* \
[2] *We report total training memory footprint on all GPUs instead of the memory footprint per GPU as in maskrcnn-benchmark*. \
[3] *All results are obtained with a single model and without any test time data augmentation such as multi-scale, flipping and etc..* \
[4] *Our results have been improved since our initial release. If you want to check out our original results, please checkout commit [f4fd589](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS/tree/f4fd58966f45e64608c00b072c801de7f86b4f3a)*.

## Training

The following command line will train FCOS_R_50_FPN_1x on 8 GPUs with Synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):

    python -m torch.distributed.launch \
        --nproc_per_node=8 \
        --master_port=$((RANDOM + 10000)) \
        tools/train_net.py \
        --skip-test \
        --config-file configs/fcos/fcos_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml \
        DATALOADER.NUM_WORKERS 2 \
        OUTPUT_DIR training_dir/fcos_R_50_FPN_1x
        
Note that:
1) If you want to use fewer GPUs, please change `--nproc_per_node` to the number of GPUs. No other settings need to be changed. The total batch size does not depends on `nproc_per_node`. If you want to change the total batch size, please change `SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH` in [configs/fcos/fcos_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml](configs/fcos/fcos_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml).
2) The models will be saved into `OUTPUT_DIR`.
3) If you want to train FCOS with other backbones, please change `--config-file`.
4) We haved noted that training FCOS with 4 GPUs (4 images per GPU) can achieve slightly better performance than with 8 GPUs (2 images per GPU). We are working to find the reasons. But if you pursuit the best performance, we suggest you train your models with 4 GPUs as long as an out-of-memory error does not happen.
5) Sometimes you may encounter a deadlock with 100% GPUs' usage, which might be a problem of NCCL. Please try `export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` before running the training command line.
6) The link of ImageNet pre-training X-101-64x4d in the code is invalid. Please download the model [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/k3ys35075jmU1RP/download).
