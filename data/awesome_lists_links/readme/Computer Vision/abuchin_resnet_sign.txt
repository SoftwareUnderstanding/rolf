# ResNet for finger numbers


## Description

This notebook contains the deep convolutiona neural network trained to distinguish the numbers shown by fingers on images. It develops on existing VGG neural network and uses the altered loss function to generate the novel images. The original network could be found: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 The original resnet weights could be found: https://www.kaggle.com/keras/resnet50  It has been developed as a part of the course deeplearning.ai The notebook contains the code and explanations.
