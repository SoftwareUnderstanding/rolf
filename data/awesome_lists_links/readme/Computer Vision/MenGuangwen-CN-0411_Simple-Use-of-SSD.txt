# Simple-Use-of-SSD



This code  just for learner at beginning. It is based on amdegroot's SSD work.

|Win 10
|python 3.5 
|pytorch 1.0

creat the folder named weights

then download :ssd300_mAP_77.43_v2.pth  form:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/ssd300_mAP_77.43_v2.pth  or 
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mlDIoW-B845YB16TQBj3Gw     Extracted code : 88xr   

and put in weights

then run:

python demo.py

you will see the result.  
It will help you learn how SSD work for detecting a pic. If you want to know much more about train , please see : https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch
