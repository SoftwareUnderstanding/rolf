# LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder for Text Encodings
This repository contains my implementation of an LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) for text encoding and generation.

See https://github.com/arogers1/VAE_LSTM_Text_Encoding/blob/master/Variational%20Autoencoder%20LSTM%20Text%20Encoding.ipynb for a Jupyter notebook demoing the code on a dataset built from NLTK corpora.

Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114, https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908, and https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html.
