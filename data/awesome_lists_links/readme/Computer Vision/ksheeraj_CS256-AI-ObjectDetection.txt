# CS256-AI-Human and Object Detection
# Group A

## Project Summary
The primary objective of our project was to improve human and object detection on low-light/dark images. We've used [EnlightenGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06972) and have also used EnlightenGAN with different combinations of image filters such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Unsharp Mask (USM) to enhance low-light/dark images. The model that we used for human and object detection on these enlightened images was [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) and found significant improvement in the performance. For more details, please refer to the [project report](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/CS256_ProjectReport.pdf) and [presentation slides](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/Presentation_FinalMilestone.pdf).

## INSTALLATION
The list below provides instructions on how to implement the deep learning models and image filters we used.
- **Faster R-CNN**
  
  *We implemented the Faster R-CNN model on both AWS and Google COLAB.*
  
  - See [Faster R-CNN_AWS_Instructions](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/Faster%20R-CNN_AWS_Instructions.pdf)
  - See [Google COLAB Instructions](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RaWxgclMB8RpITo8Kci1qTecfm8iT61z)
- **EnlightenGAN**
  - See [EnlightenGAN_Setup](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/EnlightenGAN_AWS_Instructions.pdf)
- **CLAHE & USM**
  - See [CLAHE&UnsharpMask_Setup](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/Filters/CLAHE%26UnsharpMask_Setup.pdf)
- **Finetuned Faster R-CNN**
  - See [Google COLAB Instructions](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RaWxgclMB8RpITo8Kci1qTecfm8iT61z)

**Note:** The same COLAB file is used for Faster R-CNN and finetuned Faster R-CNN.

## Architecture Diagrams

Now that you have installed the required deep learning models and image filters, you can use them to run through each of the architecture diagrams below.

Based on this diagram, we are running inference on low-light/dark images, taken from the Exclusively Dark dataset, using the Faster R-CNN model from Detectron2. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on a low-light/dark image.**

![alt text](https://github.com/ksheeraj/CS256-AI-ObjectDetection/blob/master/Architecture_Diagrams/Architecture_Diagram_2.png)

Based on this diagram, we are feeding in a few low-light/dark images into EnlightenGAN and then feeding in the fake images generated by EnlightenGAN into the same Faster R-CNN model as the one used in Architecture Diagram 1. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on enlightened/enhanced images.**

Based on this diagram, we are feeding in a few low-light/dark images into an image filter, called CLAHE. This filter will compute several histograms, each corresponding to a distinct section of the image, and use them to redistribute the lightness values of the image. Then the image outputs of this filter will be fed into the same Faster R-CNN model that we have been using so far. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on low-light/dark images that have been fed through an image filter.**

As showcased in this diagram, the first two steps are a subset of Architecture Diagram 3. For this experiment, we will be taking the output images produced by the CLAHE filter and feed it through EnlightenGAN. Since EnlightenGAN adds noise to its output images, we feed the output images from EnlightenGAN into the CLAHE filter to filter out the noise. Then the output images from the CLAHE filter are fed into the Faster R-CNN model that we have been working with so far. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on images that have been applied with an image filter before and after EnlightenGAN.**

As showcased in this diagram, the last three steps are a subset of Architecture Diagram 4. For this experiment, we are feeding in a few low-light/dark images into an image filter, called USM. This filter will amplify the high-frequency components of an image and produce an output with better contrast and brightness. We will be taking the output images produced by the USM filter and feed it through EnlightenGAN and follow Architecture Diagram 4 thereafter. **The intent of this experiment is to examine how Faster R-CNN performs on images that have been applied with a combination of image filters before and after EnlightenGAN.**

Based on this diagram, we are finetuning our pretrained FasterRCNN using enlightened COCO dataset images. We're first feeding 5000 images from the COCO validation dataset through the enlightenGAN. These output images are combined into a custom dataset which are then used to finetune our existing FasterRCNN model. **The intent of this approach was to improve object detection on the output images produced by EnlightenGAN. As the enlightened images contain noise, we were hoping that the model would get better at detecting objects in this noise. This experiment turned out to work perfectly and the resulting fine-tuned FasterRCNN performed much better.**
