Video Object Detection Using SSD
<h4>"""Single Shot Multibox Architecture
    The network is composed of a base VGG network followed by the
    added multibox conv layers.  Each multibox layer branches into
        1) conv2d for class conf scores
        2) conv2d for localization predictions
        3) associated priorbox layer to produce default bounding
           boxes specific to the layer's feature map size.
    See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf for more details.

    Args:
        phase: (string) Can be "test" or "train"
        base: VGG16 layers for input, size of either 300 or 500
        extras: extra layers that feed to multibox loc and conf layers
        head: "multibox head" consists of loc and conf conv layers
