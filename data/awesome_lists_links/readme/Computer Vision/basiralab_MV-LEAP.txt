# Introduction

This work has been published in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods 2019. MV-LEAP is a framework for boosting the classification of imbalanced multi-view data. MV-LEAP comprises two key steps addressing two major machine learning problems in classification tasks:

**Issue 1: Training data imbalance.**  

**Proposed solution ==>** Manifold learning-based proliferator, which enables to generate synthetic data for each view, is proposed to handle imbalanced data.

**Issue 2: Heterogeneity of the input multi-view data to learn from.**

**Proposed solution ==>** A multi-view manifold data alignment leveraging tensor canonical correlation analysis is proposed to map all original (i.e., ground truth) and proliferated (i.e., synthesized) views into a shared subspace where their distributions are aligned for the target classification task.

More details can be found at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016502701930202X) or https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334162522_Multi-View_Learning-Based_Data_Proliferator_for_Boosting_Classification_Using_Highly_Imbalanced_Classes

In this repository, we release the MV-LEAP source code trained and tested on a simulated heterogeneous multi-view dataset drawn from 4 Gaussian distributions as shown below:

# Installation

This framework was developed on Matlab R2018a. It uses the following Matlab packages:
tensor_toolbox_2.6 <br/>
SMOTE <br/>
SIMLR <br/>
PCA <br/>
TCCA <br/>

You also need to use the packages in the bib folder included in the following repositories: `bib` and `bib/src/`.
To use the bib codes, you need to load the bib path in the MV-LEAP code. Use the function: addpath('bib/')

# Data
In order to use our framework, you need to provide: 
1) A cell arrays (X) including the data matrices, where each cell represents a data view. Each data matrix should be of size ns × nf (ns = number of samples and nf = number of features), where each row represents a sample, and each column represents a feature. 
2) A label vector (Y) storing the labels for all samples, where **0 represents the majority class label** and **1 represents the minority class label.**

The input data should have (.mat) format and needs to be loaded using the matlab load function. 

# Run the code
First unzip both: tensor_toolbox-master.zip and Bib.zip files.

To test our code, run the demo: MV_LEAP_demo.m

A brief description of the script files: <br/>
MV_learning.m: includes the main code of MV-LEAP.<br/>
mv_leap_figures: plots the results.<br/>
MV_LEAP_func: runs MV-LEAP functions.<br/>
Smote_func: includes data proliferation code.<br/>
