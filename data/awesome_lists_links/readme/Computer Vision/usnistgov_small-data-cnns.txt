# Input Data Constraints

Input data assumptions:
- image type: grayscale image with one of these pixel types: uint8, uint16, int32, float32
- mask type: grayscale image with one of these pixel types: uint8, uint16, int32
- masks must be integer values of the class each pixel belongs to
- mask pixel value 0 indicates background/no-class
- each input image must have a corresponding mask 
- each image/mask pair must be identical size
- each image/mask should be square (width = height)

Before training script can be launched, the input data needs to be converted into a memory mapped database ([lmdb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database)) to enable fast memory mapped file reading during training. 

# LMDB Construction
This training code uses lmdb databases to store the image and mask data to enable parallel memory-mapped file reader to keep the GPUs fed. 

The input folder of images and masks needs to be split into train and test. Train to update the model parameters, and test to estimate the generalization accuracy of the resulting model. By default 80% of the data is used for training, 20% for test.


```
python build_lmdb.py -h
usage: build_lmdb [-h] [--image_folder IMAGE_FOLDER]
                  [--mask_folder MASK_FOLDER]
                  [--output_filepath OUTPUT_FILEPATH]
                  [--dataset_name DATASET_NAME]
                  [--train_fraction TRAIN_FRACTION]

                        what fraction of the dataset to use for training
```


# Training
With the lmdb build there are two methods for training a model. 

1. Cluster: Single Node Multi GPU
	- the include shell script `launch_train_sbatch.sh` is setup to all training on the Enki Cluster.
2. Local: Single Node Multi GPU
	- If you want to train the model on local hardware, avoid using `launch_train_sbatch.sh`, use python and directly launch `train_unet.py` or `train_segnet.py`

Whether you launch the training locally or on Enki, the training script will query the system and determine how many GPUs are available. It will then build the network for training using data-parallelism. So when you define your batch size, it will actually be multiplied by the number of GPUs you are using to train the network. So a batch size of 8 training on 4 gpus, results in an actual batch size of 32. Each GPU computes its own forward pass on its own data, computes the gradient, and then all N gradients are averaged. The gradient averaging can either happen on the CPU, or on any of the GPUs. 

On Enki, the GPUs have a fully connected topology:

```

However, on other systems this might not be the case:

2019-02-27 13:45:05.405315: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:971] 3:   N N Y N 
```

If the fully connected GPU topology exists, perform gradient averaging on one of the GPUs (`gpu:0` by default). Otherwise, it is faster to transfer the gradient information to the CPU and perform the gradient averaging on `cpu:0`. The training script controls where the gradient averaging happens with the option: `gradient_update_location`.

The full help for the training script is:

A few of the arguments require explanation.

- `number_classes`: you need to specify the number of classes being segmented so the network knows how to format the output. The input labels are integers indicating the classes. However, under the hood tensorflow needs a one-hot encoding of the class, so this tells the model how to expand the input label into a one-hot encoding of the class id.
- `test_every_n_steps`: typically, you run test/validation every epoch. However, I am often building models with very small amounts of data (e.g. 500 images). With an actual batch size of 32, that allows me 15 gradient updates per epoch. The model does not change that fast, so I impose a fixed global step count between test so that I don't spend all of my GPU time running the test data. A good value for this is typically 1000.
- `early_stopping`: this is an integer specifying the early stopping criteria. If the model test loss does not improve after this number of epochs (epoch defined as `test_every_n_steps steps` updates) training is terminated because we have moved into overfitting the training dataset.
- `gradient_update_location`: whether to perform gradient averaging on the CPU or GPU. See the above discussion about GPU connection topology.
- `restore_checkpoint_filepath`: if you provide a filepath to a previous training of the same model, the training script will load the model weights, restoring that checkpoint before continuing to train. The filepath to the checkpoint should be like "~/Semantic-Segmentation/UNet/model/checkpoint/model.ckpt-6" do not include the ".index", ".meta", or ".data" component of the checkpoint filepath.


# Image Readers
One of the defining features of this codebase is the parallel (python multiprocess) image reading from lightning memory mapped databases. 

There are typically 1 or more reader threads feeding each GPU. 

Each ImageReader class instance:
- selects the next image (potentially at random from the shuffled dataset)
- loads images from a shared lmdb read-only reference
- determines the image augmentation parameters from by defining augmentation limits
- applies the augmentation transformation to the image and mask pair
- add the augmented image to the batch that reader is building
- once a batch is constructed, the imagereader adds it to the output queue shared among all of the imagereaders

The training script setups of python generators which just get a reference to the output batch queue data and pass it into tensorflow. One of the largest bottlenecks in deep learning is keeping the GPUs fed. By performing the image reading and data augmentation asynchronously all the main python training thread has to do is get a reference to the next batch (which is waiting in memory) and pass it to tensorflow to be copied to the GPUs.

If the imagereaders do not have enough bandwidth to keep up with the GPUs you can increase the number of readers per gpu, though 1 or 2 readers per gpus is often enough. 

You will know whether the image readers are keeping up with the GPUs. When the imagereader output queue is getting empty a warning is printed to the log:

```
Input Queue Starvation !!!!
```

along with the matching message letting you know when the imagereaders have caught back up:

```
Input Queue Starvation Over
```

# Image Augmentation

For each image being read from the lmdb, a unique set of augmentation parameters are defined. 

the `augment` class supports:

| Transformation  | Parameterization |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| reflection (x, y) | Bernoulli  |
| rotation  | Uniform |
| jitter (x, y)  | Percent of Image Size  |
| scale (x,y)  | Percent Change |
| noise  | Percent Change of Current Image Dynamic Range  |
| blur  | Uniform Selection of Kernel Size |
| pixel intensity  | Percent Change of Current Image Dynamic Range |


These augmentation transformations are generally configured based on domain expertise and stay fixed per dataset.

Currently the only method for modifying them is to open the `imagereader.py` file and edit the augmentation parameters contained within the code block within the imagereader `__init__`:

```
# setup the image data augmentation parameters
self._reflection_flag = True
self._rotation_flag = True
self._jitter_augmentation_severity = 0.1  # x% of a FOV
self._noise_augmentation_severity = 0.02  # vary noise by x% of the dynamic range present in the image
self._scale_augmentation_severity = 0.1  # vary size by x%
self._blur_max_sigma = 2  # pixels
# self._intensity_augmentation_severity = 0.05
```
