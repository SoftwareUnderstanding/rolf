# Neural style transfer



## Overview

Given a content image and a style image this art generation model can then blend the style in the content image and create new artistic pieces.



**The modeluses a pretrained vgg-19**

## Dependencies

scipy

numpy

tensorflow

PIL

matplotlib


Install dependencies using pip 

Install jupyter notebook using pip

## Usage

Type juptyer notebook into terminal and a browser window will pop up. Click on neural style transfer1.ipynb. You can iteratively compile each block of code to see the output results.

The Neural Style Transfer algorithm was due to Gatys et al. (2015). Harish Narayanan and Github user "log0" also have highly readable write-ups from which we drew inspiration. The pre-trained network used in this implementation is a VGG network, which is due to Simonyan and Zisserman (2015). Pre-trained weights were from the work of the MathConvNet team.
