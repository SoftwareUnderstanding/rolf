# AdaIN-reimplementation (Real-Time Style-Transfer)


I am reimplementing AdaIn for the OAK-1. You can see progress at my [blog](https://antiprojects.com/adain). TLDR, I have gotten the model training, and the images look decent for now. Next I will shrink the model for the OAK-1.


You can run the code like so:

```python3 main.py --crop "run description 1 2 3"```


Here are some results (style, content, stylized):
