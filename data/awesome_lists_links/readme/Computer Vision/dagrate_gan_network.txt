# gan_network

The gan_network library is a Python library that proposes Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for numerical simulations. Two types of WGAN are implemented: 
- a standard WGAN as described in [1] and [2]
- a gradient penalty GAN as described in [3]

----------------------------

## Dependencies

The library uses **Python 3** and the following modules:
- numpy (pip install numpy)
- keras (pip install numba)
- pylab (pip install pylab)
- functools (pip install pylab)
- sklearn (pip install sklearn)

If running in Linux distribution, it is advised to install BLAS/LAPACK to increase the efficiency of the computations:  
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran

----------------------------

## Quick Start

The standard WGAN is available in the file WGAN_std.py

The gradient penalty WGAN is available in the file WGAN_gradientpenalty.py

```python
```
