## Introduction

MMSegmentation is an open source semantic segmentation toolbox based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the OpenMMLab project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.

### Major features

- **Unified Benchmark**

  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various semantic segmentation methods.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the semantic segmentation framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized semantic segmentation framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple methods out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary semantic segmentation frameworks, *e.g.* PSPNet, DeepLabV3, PSANet, DeepLabV3+, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases.

## Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md#installation) for installation and dataset preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [train.md](docs/train.md) and [inference.md](docs/inference.md) for the basic usage of MMSegmentation.
There are also tutorials for [customizing dataset](docs/tutorials/customize_datasets.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing modules](docs/tutorials/customize_models.md), and [customizing runtime](docs/tutorials/customize_runtime.md).
We also provide many [training tricks](docs/tutorials/training_tricks.md).

A Colab tutorial is also provided. You may preview the notebook [here](demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) or directly [run](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) on Colab.
