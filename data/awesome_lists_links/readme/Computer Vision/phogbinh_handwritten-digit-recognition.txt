# Handwritten Digit Recognition
## Description
This is a MATLAB implementation of a 2 hidden-layers neural network that recognizes handwritten digit with 97% accuracy on MNIST database. The architecture and training parameters of the network is configurable (including number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, number of training rounds, learning rate, and mini-batch length). The network integrates input normalization, He weight initialization [1], and Swish activation function [2].
