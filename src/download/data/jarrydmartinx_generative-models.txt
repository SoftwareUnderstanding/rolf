# generative-models
A series of notebooks implementing a suite of generative models of images.

These are meant to serve as:
* A refresher exercise for myself on unsupervised learning models and Tensorflow (especially TF2)
* A set of reference implementations of some basic ML components that I need for my own research.

Libraries and tools used:
* All of these are Google Colab Notebooks: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
* All of them are written in Tensorflow (mostly TF2, but some are in TF1)
* Some use the Sonnet library of abstractions for ML research https://sonnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, and some use the Keras library for deep learning https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras

To date I've implemented the following generative models:

 **Variational Autoencoder**
