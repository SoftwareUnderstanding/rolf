# Res2Net for object detection and instance segmentation based on mmdetection.

## News
- Res2Net is now one of the basic bonebones in MMDetection v2 framework https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.
Using MMDetection v2 with Res2Net achieves better performance with less computational cost.
- Res2Net with mmdetection v2 is now available in https://github.com/Res2Net/mmdetection/tree/mmdet_res2net.
## Introduction

We propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer.

|    Backbone     |Params. | GFLOPs  | top-1 err. | top-5 err. |
| :-------------: |:----:  | :-----: | :--------: | :--------: |
| ResNet-101      |44.6 M  | 7.8     |  22.63     |  6.44      |
| ResNeXt-101-64x4d |83.5M | 15.5    |  20.40     |  -         |
| HRNetV2p-W48    | 77.5M  | 16.1    |  20.70     |  5.50      |
| Res2Net-101     | 45.2M  | 8.3     |  18.77     |  4.64      |

Compared with other backbone networks, Res2Net requires fewer parameters and FLOPs.

**Note:**
- GFLOPs for classification are calculated with image size (224x224).

# MMDetection

**News**: We released the technical report on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07155).

Documentation: https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1 to 1.4**.

mmdetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the open-mmlab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

![demo image](demo/coco_test_12510.jpg)

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs now. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.
