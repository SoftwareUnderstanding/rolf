# unet
My implementation of the UNet ConvNet for image segmentation.

Based off of the paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf).

Being the first model I have created in Tensorflow, I had to reference other people's implementations of UNet in order to get going, most notably user zhixuhao unet implementation (https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet). The train and test images also come from this repo.
