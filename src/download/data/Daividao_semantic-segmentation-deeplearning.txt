# Semantic segmentation of Left Ventricle with Deep Learning
Here is my work during the REU at UC Berkeley. See **report.pdf** for more detail.

## Dependency
  * Python 3.7
  * Tensorflow 2.0 (for implementing deep learning models)
  * SimpleITK (for cleaning medical images)
    
## Dataset
  * Cardiac Images from Shawn Shadden Lab at UC Berkeley
  
## Deep Learning Architecture
  * U-Net: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf
  * Deep Stack Transformation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03347.pdf
  
## Result
  * Accuracy: 92%


## Sample segmentation:
