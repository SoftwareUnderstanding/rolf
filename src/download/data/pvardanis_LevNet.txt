# LevNet: A CNN architecture for optimizing the acoustic levitation algorithm

This project experiments with several CNN architectures trained on the ImageNet dataset (or custom ones). Previously, a UNET architecture has been successfully used for a similar approach (particle volume reconstruction from an in-line hologram), that replaces traditional reconstruction algorithms in digital holography (https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-58-8-1900). In our approach, we aim to find an architecture that maps the positions of an arbitrary number of levitated particles, represented as a 2d image, to the phases of 512 transducers that create pressure traps in space.
