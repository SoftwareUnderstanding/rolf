# Modified-mnist

The task is image classification for modified MNIST
dataset which can be found in the link[1]. Task 1 is to use models including logistic regression,
vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to train the
dataset. Examples from github[2] are used to help build the models and validate the results.
Task 2 is to implement the gated convolutional neural network (GCN) developed by Dauphin et
al. to train the dataset.
