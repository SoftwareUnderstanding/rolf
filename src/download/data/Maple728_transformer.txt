# Transformer

Tensorflow 1.0 implementation of Transformer model (paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 

## Process
1. Complete the model, but the evaluation part need to complement.
2. Test model in regression, but the performance is not good.
3. **TODO**Test model in classification.

## Requirements
- python>=3.6
- tensorflow>=1.13.0
- numpy


Dependency can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training
```bash

```


## Model Evaluating
```bash

```
