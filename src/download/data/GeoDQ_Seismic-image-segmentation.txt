# Seismic-image-segmentation
This is a deep learning exercise on segmenting salt deposits beneath the Earth's surface. Data is from TGS Salt Identification Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/data). 80 training images and 80 masks(a portion of the data from TGS) are used in this experiment. The architecture used in this work is called U-net, which is common for segmentation problems, please check here (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) for the original paper on U-net.
