* Stanford Deep NLP 2019:

http://onlinehub.stanford.edu/youtube-cs224n-natural-language-processing-with-deep-learning-winter-2019

session1,2: good to get an appropriate start point and general view of deep natural language processing fundamentals. 

session3: an introduction to neural networks

session4: get a little deep into basics of backpropagation

session5: dependency parsing (I do not suggest this unless parsing is the task you are working on.)

session6,7,8: are about RNNs. It disscusses different types of it, and following a main stream it sheds light on the methods solved its challenges. It is proposed in a well-defined structure with appropriate amount of mathematical fundamentals. These are all too delicious to follow :)

* Andrew Ng ML: 

week 10: a set of introductions to large scale machine learning that includes a method to apply ml algorithms in a map-reduce based framework. 

week 11: an introduction to ocr and image processing. It really helped me to get much more interested in ML than before. Actually, from then I'm much more ml fan than just text-mining, my first love in computer science.
