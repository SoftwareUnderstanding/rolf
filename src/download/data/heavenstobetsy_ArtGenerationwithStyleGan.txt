# Art Generation with StyleGAN

## Notes
This project builds off of, and is inspired by StyleGAN - Official TensorFlow Implementation https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948

I scraped Fauvism art from WikiArt as the basis of this model, as it's a distinct, fun style with bold colors and thick lines of paint--perfect for experimentation.  I also used Google Colab notebook for this project; it's a first--I wanted to learn how Google Colab functions, and what can be done with it.

#### This project is currently being trained; I am finalizing the quality of the artwork.  In the meantime, the Sample Images folder contains snapshots of the training in progess. Enjoy!
