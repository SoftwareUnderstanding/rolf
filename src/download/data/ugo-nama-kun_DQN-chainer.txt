# DQN-chainer

This software is a python implementation of Deep Q-Networks for playing ATARI games with Chainer package.

I followed the implementation described in:
* V. Mnih *et al*., "Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning"

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf
* V. Mnih *et al.*, "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"

For japanese instruction of DQN and historical review, please check:

# Requirement
My implementation is dependent on RL-glue, Arcade Learning Environment, and Chainer. To run the software, you need following softwares/packages.

* Python 2.7+
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Pillow (PIL)
* Chainer (1.3.0): https://github.com/pfnet/chainer
* RL-glue core: https://sites.google.com/a/rl-community.org/rl-glue/Home/rl-glue
* RL-glue Python codec: https://sites.google.com/a/rl-community.org/rl-glue/Home/Extensions/python-codec
* Arcade Learning Environment (version ALE 0.4.4): http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/

This software was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
