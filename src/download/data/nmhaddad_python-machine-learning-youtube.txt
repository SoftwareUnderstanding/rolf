## Abstract:
Our objective for this project is to provide YouTube content creators with a detailed trend analysis and probabilistic interpretation of what makes a top trending video on the platform in order to maximize the reach and quality of creator content. To do so, we performed a number of small experiments including learning word embeddings and examining linear relationships in comments, titles, and descriptions in YouTube videos using word2vec neural networks. A second experiment uses a VGG-19 neural network in a self-organizing map as part of a detailed analysis of video thumbnails. We also performed a number of other small tasks, and learned a lot along the way!
