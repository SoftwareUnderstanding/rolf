## Pure Tensorflow

- Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) 


- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Word Vector Model (CBOW/SKIPGRAM)

- Long Term Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)

- Multi-Task Learning Network(alternate back-propagation) 


## Keras


Coming Soon



## Dependencies

1. Python3, samples codes uses many of the Python3 features.
2. Numpy, only needed in sample codes.
3. Tensorflow, tested with Tensorflow 1.4.
4. Keras
5. Jupyter Notebook



## How to Use

The Jupyter Notebooks are self explanatory


## Future Work

- [ ] Generative Adversarial Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
