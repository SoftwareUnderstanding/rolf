This repository contains a re-implementation of the Graph Convolutional Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).

The model is tested on the Cora dataset (https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/lbc/cora.tgz).

To run this code:
- Have Python and Pytorch installed (code was tested with Python 3.6.9 and Pytorch 1.3.1)
- Copy this repository
- you may want to change some experiment parameters in main.py
- Run `$ python main.py`
