# *Faster* R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks

By Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun at Microsoft Research

### Introduction

**Faster** R-CNN is an object detection framework based on deep convolutional networks, which includes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and an Object Detection Network. Both networks are trained for sharing convolutional layers for fast testing. 

Faster R-CNN was initially described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).

This repo contains a MATLAB re-implementation of Fast R-CNN. Details about Fast R-CNN are in: [rbgirshick/fast-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn).

This code has been tested on Windows 7/8 64-bit, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Linux, and on MATLAB 2014a.

Python version is available at [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).

**Note**: The mAP results are subject to random variations. We have run 5 times independently for ZF net, and the mAPs are 59.9 (as in the paper), 60.4, 59.5, 60.1, and 59.5, with a mean of 59.88 and std 0.39.

### Training:
0. Run `experiments/script_faster_rcnn_VOC2007_ZF.m` to train a model with ZF net. It runs four steps as follows:
    - Train RPN with conv layers tuned; compute RPN results on the train/test sets.
    - Train Fast R-CNN with conv layers tuned using step-1 RPN proposals; evaluate detection mAP.
    - Train RPN with conv layers fixed; compute RPN results on the train/test sets. 
    - Train Fast R-CNN with conv layers fixed using step-3 RPN proposals; evaluate detection mAP.
    - **Note**: the entire training time is ~12 hours on K40.
0. Run `experiments/script_faster_rcnn_VOC2007_VGG16.m` to train a model with VGG net.
    - **Note**: the entire training time is ~2 days on K40.
0. Check other scripts in `./experiments` for more settings.
