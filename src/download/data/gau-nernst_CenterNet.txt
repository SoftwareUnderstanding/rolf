# CenterNet

CenterNet is a strong **single-stage**, **single-scale**, and **anchor-free** object detector. This implementation is built with PyTorch Lightning, supports TorchScript and ONNX export, and has modular design to make customizing components simple.

## Install

Dependencies

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install pytorch-lightning pycocotools albumentations
pip install git+https://github.com/gau-nernst/vision-toolbox.git            # backbones and necks
pip install filterpy git+https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/TrackEval.git    # for FairMOT
pip install jsonargparse[signatures]                                        # for training
```

## Inference

### Create a CenterNet model

Import `build_centernet` from `models` to build a CenterNet model from a YAML file. Sample config files are provided in the `configs/` directory.

```python
from centernet_lightning.models import build_centernet

model = build_centernet("configs/coco_resnet34.yaml")
```

You also can load a CenterNet model directly from a checkpoint thanks to PyTorch Lightning.

```python
from centernet_lightning.models import CenterNet

model = CenterNet.load_from_checkpoint("path/to/checkpoint.ckpt")
```

### Folder of images

Use `CenterNet.inference_detection()` or `CenterNet.inference_tracking()`

```python
model = ...     # create a model as above
img_dir = "path/to/img/dir"
detections = model.inference_detection(img_dir, num_detections=100)
```

`detections` is a dictionary with the following keys:

Key | Description | Shape
----|-------------|-------
`bboxes` | bounding boxes in x1y1x2y2 format | (num_images x num_detections x 4)
`labels` | class labels | (num_images x num_detections)
`scores` | confidence scores | (num_images x num_detections)

Results are `np.ndarray`, ready for post-processing.

### Single image

This is useful when you use `CenterNet` in your own applications

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import cv2
import albumentations as A
from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2

# read image
img = cv2.imread("path/to/image")
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# apply pre-processing: resize to 512x512 and normalize with ImageNet statistics
# use torchvision.transforms should work also
transforms = A.Compose([
    A.Resize(height=512, width=512),
    A.Normalize(),
    ToTensorV2()
])
img = transforms(image=img)["image"]

# create a model as above and put it in evaluation mode
model = ...     
model.eval()

# turn off gradient calculation and do forward pass
with torch.no_grad():
    encoded_outputs = model(img.unsqueeze(0))
    detections = model.gather_detection2d(encoded_outputs)
```

`detections` has the same format as above, but the values are `torch.Tensor`.

Note: Due to data augmentations during training, the model is robust enough to not need ImageNet normalization in inference. You can normalize input image to `[0,1]` and CenterNet should still work fine.

## Deployment

`CenterNet` is export-friendly. You can directly export a trained model to ONNX or TorchScript (only tracing) using PyTorch Lightning API

```python
import torch
from centernet_lightning.models import CenterNet

model = CenterNet.load_from_checkpoint("path/to/checkpoint.ckpt")
model.to_onnx("model.onnx", torch.rand((1,3,512,512)))      # export to ONNX
model.to_torchscript("model.pt", method="trace")            # export to TorchScript. scripting might not work
```

### Evaluate a trained model

WIP

## Training CenterNet

You can train CenterNet with the provided train script `train.py` and a config file.

```bash
python train.py --config "configs/coco_resnet34.yaml"
```

See sample config files at [configs/](configs/). To customize training, see [training.md](docs/training)
