# bert_tutorial

### Outline:
This is the github repo for the [NLSea meetup Aug.27.2019](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/events/263977182/).  
In this session, we discussed about the pytorch implementation of BERT model purposed Nov. 2018.  
The session mainly focused on 4 aspects:  

1. What is BERT and word embedding?  
2. What is a tokenizer and contextual level embedding?  
3. How to get word, sentence, and paragraph embeddings from token level embeddings?  
4. How to fine tune your own BERT model?
