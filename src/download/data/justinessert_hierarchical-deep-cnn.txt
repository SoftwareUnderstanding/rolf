# Hierarchical Deep CNN
Hierarchical Deep CNN for image recognition and labeling

This program is designed around the concept proposed in the following paper 
  
  HD-CNN: Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Large Scale Visual Recognition

I also Benjamin Graham's paper Spatially-Sparce Convolutional Neural Networks - https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6070 - as a referrence quite frequently.

This implementation uses Keras to design a hierarchical deep CNN using an NiN network structure and the Cifar100 dataset.
