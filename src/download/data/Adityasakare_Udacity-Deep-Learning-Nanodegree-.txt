# Udacity-Projects
I enrolled for Deep Learning Nanodegree course from Udacity.These projects i created from what i learnt from Udacity.
Checkout these projects and if you want to make your own do fork , clone and start experimenting. :D 


## Bike-Sharing prediction
In this project i build Neural network that  to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! It is used to predict daily bike rental ridership.
Applied Gradient Decent,  Backpropagation concepts from sratch.
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

#### The training loss is below 0.09 and the validation loss is below 0.18.

#### Predictaion Here, used the test data to view how well my network is modeling the data

## Dog Breed Classifer
This is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project,.Given an image of a dog, algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
For this project i used VGG16 model.
The accuracy on test data
`Test Loss: 0.959668
Test Accuracy: 73% (615/836)`

## TV Script Generation using RNN
In this project , i generated own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.I used some part of the [Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) dataset of scripts from 9 seasons.
The Neural Network generated a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
The RNN included an LSTM and one fully-connected layer.

## Face Generation
In this project i used used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces.
I trained a [DCGAN] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) on a dataset of faces.The goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
I used [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train adversarial networks.
