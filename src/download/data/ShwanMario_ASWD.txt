# Augmented-Sliced-Wasserstein-Distances

This repository provides the code to reproduce the experimental results in the paper **Augmented Sliced Wasserstein Distances**.
## Prerequisites

### Python packages

To install the required python packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets
Two datasets are used in this repository, namely the [CIFAR10](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.222.9220&rep=rep1&type=pdf) dataset and [CELEBA](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html) dataset.
- The CIFAR10 dataset (64x64 pixels) will be automatically downloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz when running the experiment on CIFAR10 dataset. 
- The CELEBA dataset needs be be manually downloaded and can be found on the website http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html, we use the cropped CELEBA dataset with 64x64 pixels.

### Precalculated Statistics

To calculate the [Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID score)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500), precalculated statistics for datasets

- [CIFAR 10](http://bioinf.jku.at/research/ttur/ttur_stats/fid_stats_cifar10_train.npz) (calculated on all training samples)
- [cropped CelebA](http://bioinf.jku.at/research/ttur/ttur_stats/fid_stats_celeba.npz) (64x64, calculated on all samples)

## Project & Script Descriptions
Two experiments are included in this repository, where benchmarks are from the paper [Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Distances](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8319-generalized-sliced-wasserstein-distances) and the paper [Distributional Sliced-Wasserstein and Applications to Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07367.pdf), respectively. The first one is on the task of sliced Wasserstein flow, and the second one is on generative modellings with GANs. For more details and setups, please refer to the original paper **Augmented Sliced Wasserstein Distances**.
### Directories
- ```./result/ASWD/CIFAR/``` contains generated imgaes trained with the ASWD on CIFAR10 dataset.
- ```./result/ASWD/CIFAR/fid/``` FID scores of generated imgaes trained with the ASWD on CIFAR10 dataset are saved in this folder.
- ```./result/CIFAR/``` model's weights and losses in the CIFAR10 experiment are stored in this directory.

Other setups follow the same naming rule.
### Scripts
The sliced Wasserstein flow example can be found in the [jupyter notebook](https://anonymous.4open.science/repository/e55153b2-70be-4089-9362-1443ddfaece4/Sliced%20Waaserstein%20Flow.ipynb).
