# Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks for MNIST dataset
This repository contains my ipynb notebook for implementing Deep Convolution Generative adversarial networks.We used MNIST images to train the DCGAN

About GAN :
Generative adversarial networks also called as GAN's uses an approach known as Generative Modeling with help of Deep Learning models such as CNN.Generative modelling is an unsupervised learning technqiue that typically identifies certain patterns in an image and based on these patterns we can generate new images which could have been drawn from the original dataset.In GAN's we have two components known as Generator and Discriminator.The goal of the generator is to produce fake images while the goal of the discriminator is to identify the fake images.This process involves training for large amount of epochs - wherein the training goes on until the discriminator loss is at 0.5.When the loss is at 0.5 we can say that the model is identifying fake image as a real image.
