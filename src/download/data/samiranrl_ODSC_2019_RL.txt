It shows how to apply a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Policy Gradients (Many of the recent successes in RL use this is some form) to a toy problem - where you attempt to land a small spaceship on the moon. It is built using pytorch. 

One of the most frequent questions that was asked was: How to train Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms if you are starting from scratch? Here is a list of (zero to one) resources:
