# SentAnalysis
Sentiment analyser using the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset (RNN, Pytorch)


The aim of this project is to implement a machine learning model for a sentiment analysis
task using the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset. During this project you are asked to label
phrases on a scale of five values :
0. negative
1. somewhat negative
2. neutral,
3. somewhat positive,
4. positive.
Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others
make this task very challenging.

Project Roadmap
1. Study and plot the training data
2. Split the data (train/dev)
3. Train and evaluate a vanilla deep recurrent neural network (RNN)
4. Use the Pytorch framework to train the RNN network.
5. Optimize the model and propose enhancement (Regularization, network init, new architecture)
