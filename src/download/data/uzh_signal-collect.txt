Signal/Collect
==============

Signal/Collect is a framework for computations on large graphs. The model allows to concisely express many iterated and data-flow algorithms, while the framework parallelizes and distributes the computation.

How to develop in Eclipse
-------------------------
Install the [Typesafe IDE for Scala 2.11](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html).

Ensure that Eclipse uses a Java 8 library and JVM: Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → JRE/JDK 8 should be installed and selected.

Import the project into Eclipse: File → Import... → Maven → Existing Maven Projects → select "signal-collect" folder
