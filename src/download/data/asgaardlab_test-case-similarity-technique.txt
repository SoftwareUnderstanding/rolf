## Identifying Similar Test Cases That Are Specified in Natural Language

This repository contains the source code of our technique and related experiments to identify similar test cases written in natural language. The technique first clusters test steps which are semantically similar and then uses those clusters to identify similar test cases.

</br>

To cluster similar test steps, we performed several experiments with the following text embedding techniques, text similarity metrics, and clustering algorithms:

**Text embedding techniques**

* [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf)
* [BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf&usg=ALkJrhhzxlCL6yTht2BRmH9atgvKFxHsxQ)
* [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf)
* [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf)
* TF-IDF


**Text similarity metrics**

* [Word  Moverâ€™s  Distance  (WMD) ](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.pdf)
* Cosine score

**Clustering algorithms**

* Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
* K-means

</br>
To find similar test cases, we used the identified clusters of similar test steps to build and evaluate four different techniques.
