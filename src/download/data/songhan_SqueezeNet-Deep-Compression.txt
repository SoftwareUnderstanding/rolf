# SqueezeNet-Deep-Compression
This is the 660KB compressed SqueezeNet, which is 363x smaller as AlexNet but has the same accuracy as AlexNet. 

(There is an even smaller version which is only 470KB. It requires some effort to materialize since each weight is 6-bits.)

# Usage

    export CAFFE_ROOT=$your_caffe_root

    python decode.py /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/SqueezeNet_deploy.prototxt /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/compressed_SqueezeNet.net /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/decompressed_SqueezeNet.caffemodel

    note: decompressed_SqueezeNet.caffemodel is the output, can be any name.

    $CAFFE_ROOT/build/tools/caffe test --model=SqueezeNet_trainval.prototxt --weights=decompressed_SqueezeNet.caffemodel --iterations=1000 --gpu 0
