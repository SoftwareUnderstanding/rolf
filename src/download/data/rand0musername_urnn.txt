Own implementation of a Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Network (uRNN), as proposed by Arjovsky et al. [[arXiv:1511.06464](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06464)]. The network is implemented using TensorFlow, and its performance is evaluated on several problems referenced in the original paper.

Developed as a project in [Petnica Summer Institute: Machine Learning](http://psiml.petnica.rs) in 2017.
