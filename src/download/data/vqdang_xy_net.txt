# HoVer-Net: Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Nuclei in Multi-Tissue Histology Images

A multiple branch network that performs nuclear instance segmentation and classification within a single network. The network leverages the horizontal and vertical distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass to separate clustered cells. A dedicated up-sampling branch is used to classify the nuclear type for each segmented instance. <br />

This is the official PyTorch implementation of HoVer-Net. For the original TensorFlow version of this code, please refer to [this branch](https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net/tree/tensorflow-final). The repository can be used for training HoVer-Net and to process image tiles or whole-slide images. As part of this repository, we supply model weights trained on the following datasets:

- [CoNSeP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841519301045)
- [PanNuke](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10778)
- [MoNuSAC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8880654)
- [Kumar](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7872382)
- [CPM17](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2019.00053/full)

Links to the checkpoints can be found in the inference description below.

# Running the Code

## Training

### Data Format
For training, patches must be extracted using `extract_patches.py`. For instance segmentation, patches are stored as a 4 dimensional numpy array with channels [RGB, inst]. Here, inst is the instance segmentation ground truth. I.e pixels range from 0 to N, where 0 is background and N is the number of nuclear instances for that particular image. 

For simultaneous instance segmentation and classification, patches are stored as a 5 dimensional numpy array with channels [RGB, inst, type]. Here, type is the ground truth of the nuclear type. I.e every pixel ranges from 0-K, where 0 is background and K is the number of classes.

Before training:

- Set path to the data directories in `config.py`
- Set path where checkpoints will be saved  in `config.py`
- Set path to pretrained Preact-ResNet50 weights in `models/hovernet/opt.py`. Download the weights [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KntZge40tAHgyXmHYVqZZ5d2p_4Qr2l5/view?usp=sharing).
- Modify hyperparameters, including number of epochs and learning rate in `models/hovernet/opt.py`.

### Usage and Options
 
Usage: <br />
```
  python run_train.py [--gpu=<id>] [--view=<dset>]
  python run_train.py (-h | --help)
  python run_train.py --version
```

Options:
```
  -h --help       Show this string.
  --version       Show version.
  --gpu=<id>      Comma separated GPU list.  
  --view=<dset>   Visualise images after augmentation. Choose 'train' or 'valid'.
```

Examples:

To visualise the training dataset as a sanity check before training use:
```
python run_train.py --view='train'
```

To initialise the training script with GPUs 0 and 1, the command is:
```
python run_train.py --gpu='0,1' 
```

## Inference

### Data Format
Input: <br />
- Standard images files, including `png`, `jpg` and `tiff`.
- WSIs supported by [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/), including `svs`, `tif`, `ndpi` and `mrxs`.

Output: <br />
- Both image tiles and whole-slide images output a `json` file with keys:
    - 'bbox': bounding box coordinates for each nucleus
    - 'centroid': centroid coordinates for each nucleus
    - 'contour': contour coordinates for each nucleus 
    - 'type_prob': per class probabilities for each nucleus (default configuration doesn't output this)
    - 'type': prediction of category for each nucleus
- Image tiles output a `mat` file, with keys:
    - 'raw': raw output of network (default configuration doesn't output this)
    - 'inst_map': instance map containing values from 0 to N, where N is the number of nuclei
    - 'inst_type': list of length N containing predictions for each nucleus
 - Image tiles output a `png` overlay of nuclear boundaries on top of original RGB image
  
### Model Weights

Model weights obtained from training HoVer-Net as a result of the above instructions can be supplied to process input images / WSIs. Alternatively, any of the below pre-trained model weights can be used to process the data. These checkpoints were initially trained using TensorFlow and were converted using `convert_chkpt_tf2pytorch.py`. Provided checkpoints either are either trained for segmentation alone or for simultaneous segmentation and classification. Note, we do not provide a segmentation and classification model for CPM17 and Kumar because classification labels aren't available.

**IMPORTANT:** CoNSeP, Kumar and CPM17 checkpoints use the original model mode, whereas PanNuke and MoNuSAC use the fast model mode. Refer to the inference instructions below for more information.

```

The above command can be used from the command line or via an executable script. We supply two example executable scripts: one for tile processing and one for WSI processing. To run the scripts, first make them executable by using `chmod +x run_tile.sh` and `chmod +x run_tile.sh`. Then run by using `./run_tile.sh` and `./run_wsi.sh`.

Intermediate results are stored in cache. Therefore ensure that the specified cache location has enough space! Preferably ensure that the cache location is SSD.

Note, it is important to select the correct model mode when running inference. 'original' model mode refers to the method described in the original medical image analysis paper with a 270x270 patch input and 80x80 patch output. 'fast' model mode uses a 256x256 patch input and 164x164 patch output. Model checkpoints trained on Kumar, CPM17 and CoNSeP are from our original publication and therefore the 'original' mode **must** be used. For PanNuke and MoNuSAC, the 'fast' mode **must** be selected. The model mode for each checkpoint that we provide is given in the filename. Also, if using a model trained only for segmentation, `nr_types` must be set to 0.

`type_info.json` is used to specify what RGB colours are used in the overlay. Make sure to modify this for different datasets and if you would like to generally control overlay boundary colours.

As part of our tile processing implementation, we add an option to save the output in a form compatible with QuPath. 

Take a look on how to utilise the output in `examples/usage.ipynb`.
