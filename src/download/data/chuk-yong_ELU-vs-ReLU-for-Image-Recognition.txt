# ELU-vs-ReLU-for-Image-Recognition
## Using elu on Keras to achieve 95% accuracy on Cifar-10 dataset
elu = Exponential Linear Units
Referencing the article in https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07289v1
ELU "speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies" and also "ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to better generalization performance once networks have many layers (>= 5"
Using the model published by the keras team: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py as the base model (w/o image augmentation) for comparison.

I was able to get 75% accuracy with 20 epochs with the base model.

### ELU is awesome!
Switching to elu, it returned 95% accuracy!

### Training Accuracy Up, Validation Accuracy Down
The strange thing however, is that although the accuracy went up, the validation accuracy was not better.

The python file contains both models.  Be sure to comment out one of the model before running.
