# SMOTE-over-Sampling
This repository is for MATLAB code for balancing of multiclass data by SMOTE. The use with age detcetion MATLAB code can be checked at https://free-thesis.com/product/age-detection-by-nn-trained-lbp-features/

This is the MATLAB implementation of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the unbalanced data. The paper followed for this is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1813.pdf. We have updated this work for multiclass dataset.
