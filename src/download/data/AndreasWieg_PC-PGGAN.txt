# PC-PGGAN

PGGAN from https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196

Implementation of PGGAN for pointclouds using Wasserstein Metric + Gradient penalty of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf

Work in progess

## Goal

Learning to represent Pointclouds with more points than 2048. 

## To do

implement 1d_conv_transpose Layer in the generator
