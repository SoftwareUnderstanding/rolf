# AM-GAN

This is a clean implementation of ["Activation Maximization Generative Adversarial Nets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02000). 

It was written with tensorflow-1.5 and python3.5. 

You can setting up the required environments according to build_env.sh. 

For the original code, see [AM-GANs-for-reproduce](https://github.com/ZhimingZhou/AM-GANs-for-reproduce).
