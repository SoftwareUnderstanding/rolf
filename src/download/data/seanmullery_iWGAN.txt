# iWGAN
Thank you to the following for the code on which this program is based.

For iWGAN implementation https://github.com/Shaofanl/Keras-GAN/blob/master/GAN/models/GAN.py

For Layernorm implementation https://github.com/DingKe/nn_playground/blob/master/layernorm/layer_norm_layers.py

To Francois Chollet for his Keras framework and book Deep Learing with Python. Pages 308-311 give some basic GAN code to get started with.

The paper by Ishaan Gulrajani, Faruk Ahmed, Martin Arjovsky, Vincent Dumoulin, Aaron Courville which introduced the iWGAN is here. https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028
