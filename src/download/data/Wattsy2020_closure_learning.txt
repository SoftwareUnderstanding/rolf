# Using Cloze Questions for Few-shot text classification
This is a repository that aims to implement and later iterate on the Pattern Exploitative Training (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07676.pdf) technique, which uses cloze questions to perform semi-supervised learning.
The latest version of the code is Prototype_Transformers.ipynb which uses prompts to fine tune GPT-2 (one of the first models in the literature to be prompted).
