# pose-estimation-detection

Pose estimation & detection has been minimally implemented using the OpenPose implementation https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation with Tensorflow. For the binary classification of poses, namely the classes : sitting or standing, the model used, MobileNet (a CNN originally trained on the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge dataset), was retrained (final layer) on a dataset of ~1500 images of poses.

The model is able to estimate the human poses as well as classify the current pose to a fairly good degree of accuracy.

### Demo

**An alternative for improving the model along with deep learning is to include heuristics, in the form of calculation of the skeletal pointsâ€™ relative distances from each other.**

 **FPS & estimation/detection varies with the CPU/GPU power.**

### Dependencies

The following are required :

- python3
- tensorflow 1.9.0 (works well even with CPU version)
- opencv3
- slim
- slidingwindow

### Cloning & installing dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SyBorg91/pose-estimation-detection
$ cd pose-estimation-detection
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pose Estimation with realtime webcam feed

```
$ python run_webcam.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 --camera=0
```

Run the above command to start pose estimation with the onboard webcam.
