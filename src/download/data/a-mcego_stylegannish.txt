# stylegannish
GAN implementation for TensorFlow 2 based on StyleGAN2 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04958.pdf)

# StyleGAN2 things not yet implemented
* R1 regularisation
* Path length regularisation
* (As such, lazy regularisation as well)
* Truncation trick (psi)
* Precision / recall statistics
* Statistics for the contribution of each resolution to the output image (Figure 8 in the paper)
* FID statistics

# Other TODO things
(None right now)
