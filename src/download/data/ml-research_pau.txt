## 1. About Padé Activation Units

### Padé Activation Units (PAU) have become [Rational Activation Functions](https://github.com/ml-research/rational_activations). 
#### Please check the updated repo [here](https://github.com/ml-research/rational_activations) !

PAU matches or outperforms common activations in terms of predictive performance and training time. 
And, therefore relieves the network designer of having to commit to a potentially underperforming choice.

## 2. Dependencies
    Check new Repo !

## 3. Installation

PAU is implemented as a pytorch extension using CUDA 10.1. So all that is needed is to install the extension.
This requires the cuda compiler and dev-tools, however the process is pretty straight forward:

in the folder /pau/cuda execute
~~~~
python3 setup.py install
~~~~
For this, you might need super user rights or work in a virtual environment.


## 4. Using PAU in Neural Networks

PAU can be integrated in the same way as any other common activation function.

~~~~
import torch
from pau.utils import PAU

model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(D_in, H),
    PAU(), # e.g. instead of torch.nn.ReLU() 
    torch.nn.Linear(H, D_out),
)
~~~~

## 5. Reproducing Results

To reproduce the reported results of the paper execute:

	$ export PYTHONPATH="./"
	$ python experiments/main.py --dataset mnist --arch conv --optimizer adam --lr 2e-3

	# DATASET: Name of the dataset, for MNIST use mnist and for Fashion-MNIST use fmnist
	# ARCH: selected neural network architecture: vgg, lenet or conv
	# OPTIMIZER: either adam or sgd
	# LR: learning rate
