# Deep-Learning

Collection of Deep Learning experiments. It is an evolving repository with new sections and experiments being added periodically.

Current components:

## 1. Computer Vision

   ### a. Deeper Networks:
          
   This work analyses and experiments with some of the leading deep networks such as GoogleNet, ResNet34 and VGG19 using datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.
      
   Library used: PyTorch
      
   ### b. Super Resolution:
