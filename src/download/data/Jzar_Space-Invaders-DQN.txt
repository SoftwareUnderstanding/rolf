# Space-Invaders-DQN
An implementation of an Asyc DQN to play Space Invaders using TensorFlow, Keras and Open-AI gym

Written in Python2

### Dependencies
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Gym
- numpy
- Gym-Retro

### Installation

Git clone the repository into a directory of your choosing

### Usage

- Inside of AsyncDQN.py you may specify the number of agents used in training, and whether or not to render each game
- As well, parameters such as how many episodes per summary saving/ checkpoint saving may also be altered
- Inside of the directory , run python AsyncDQN.py through shell or other means.
- If you have python 3 as default, run python2.

### Results

To come, finished implementation, training and hyperparameter tuning has begun

### Testing
