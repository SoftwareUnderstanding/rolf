# Unet_keras
A simple keras implementation of Unet

Original Paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)

Shamlessly taking the training data from this repo (https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet). Personally I do not want a new wheel but those old repos about Unet are not runnable. (Maybe due to the upgraded API of keras, whatever...)

If you do not like the heavy overhead of Keras, I do provide a naive trainer written in Tensorflow.

This implementation is based on Keras 2.24 and Tensorflow 1.13.
