## Results
  
**Note**:As you can see, each model has room to be improved. Any ideas or opinions are welcome!

 You can get more detailed info for this results [here](https://github.com/savageyusuff/MobilePose-Pi/blob/master/Study_on_results.md).  
 
## Requirements
For 'mobilepose-pi', you need following environment.

 Raspberry Pi (We used Pi 2 Model B for this repo)  
 Rasbian stretch (32bit)  
 Python 2.7  

## Installation
Before installation, please change swap size.

At Pi terminal, open 'dphys-swapfile'.   
```shell
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```
and change CONF_SWAPSIZE. (default is set to 100.)  
```shell
CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
```
Activate it.  
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start
```
Now you can install following things into your Pi.

PyTorch-0.2.0(499MB) - Follow [my guide](https://github.com/savageyusuff/MobilePose-Pi/blob/master/PyTorch_Installation_Guide.md).  
torchvision-0.2.1(2.7MB)  - Please install it from **source**. Repo is [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).  
OpenCV-3.4.0(1.8GB) - Follow [this guide](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/).  

Also, don't forget to install libraries.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At the end, change CONF_SWAPSIZE to 100 again.   
 
## Execution
You can evaluate your network on PC first.  
If the result seems to be good, you can try it on Pi using 'mobilepose-pi'.  

For mobilenet:   
 ```shell
python eval_pc.py --model mobilenet
```
For resnet:  
```shell
python eval_pc.py --model resnet
```
For shufflenet:  
```shell
python eval_pc.py --model shufflenet
```
 
 *I just reused the same pretrained models MobilePose-pytorch author provided.  
 For shufflenet I used my original model.  
 Of course, you can use your own models also.  
 
 You can try real-time estimation using 'run_webcam.py'  
 (I didn't change this file from original repo.)  
 Please connect webcam to PC first. Then try this.  
 ```shell
python run_webcam.py --model [name of model]
```
Currently, run_webcam.py doesn't support shufflenet.  
 
## Training
You can train three models (shufflenet/mobilenet/resnet) on your **PC**.  

You need to download MPII training [Images(12.9GB)](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/andriluka14cvpr/mpii_human_pose_v1.tar.gz). This is from [here](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download).  
After extraction, please set ROOT_DIR at dataloader.py (line.197).  

Different from [MobilePose-pytorch](https://github.com/YuliangXiu/MobilePose-pytorch)(original repo), the command is  
```python train.py --model=[name_of_model_you_want_to_train] --retrain=[bool]```

If you want to train shufflenet, you can do it just change model name.  
(i.e. ```python train.py --model=shufflenet```)  

## Model conversion
**Note**: development of this feature is currently suspended.  

For conversion, I mainly adopted [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_caffe2.html#transfering-srresnet-using-onnx).  
I recommend to do this via conda.  

1.You need to set up PC environment.
