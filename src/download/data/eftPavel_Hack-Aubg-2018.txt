Real-time Object Detection and Translation Android App

The app is developed using a model from MobileNets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), which represents a class 
of convolutional neural networks for mobile and embedded vision applications. 

It allows the user to translate the detected objects in different languages with Microsoft Translator's API.
