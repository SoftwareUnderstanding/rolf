Detecting COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning.

My goal is simply to inspire you and open your eyes to how studying computer vision/deep learning and then applying that knowledge to the medical field can make a big impact on the world.

As you can see from the results, this automatic COVID-19 detector is obtaining ~90-92% accuracy on our sample dataset based solely on X-ray images â€” no other data, including geographical location, population density, etc. was used to train this model.
