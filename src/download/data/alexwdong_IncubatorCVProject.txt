**For Next Meeting (06/20 - 06/22), please read on Dropout, Batch Normalization, Residual Nets, Kernel PCA.**

### Getting Neural Networks to train

Dropout: https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5
http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf  (The original paper, just skim it)

Batch Normalization:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/batch-normalization-for-training-of-deep-neural-networks/

Residual Nets:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf (Very clear Introduction Section)

### Feature Engineering 

Kernel PCA: http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~rita/uml_course/lectures/KPCA.pdf (Cntrl -F for "Summary of Kernel PCA) 
Maybe review Kernel notes from ML?
Does anyone have experience picking kernels?

KNN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

Spectral Clustering:
