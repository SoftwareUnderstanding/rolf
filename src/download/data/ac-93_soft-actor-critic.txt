# soft-actor-critic

This repo consists of modifications to the Spinningup implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm to allow for both image observations and discrete action spaces.

### Based on the implementations given in Spinningup

### Different approaches for discrete setting

Two different methods given for using SAC with discrete action spaces. 

* sac_discrete_gb uses the Gumbel Softmax distribtuion to reparameterize the discrete action space. This keeps algorithm similar to the original SAC implementation for continuous action spaces.
   
* sac_discrete avoids reparmeterisation and calculate the entropy and KL divergence from the discrete actions given by the policy network. This is based on the method described in [3] and is most accurate to the original SAC papers, I also find best results with this method.
   
Versions of the algorithms that work with image observations such as the atari gym environments are in the image observation directory.
