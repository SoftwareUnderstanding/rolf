# Mask-RCNN
Implementation of Mask-RCNN in Caffe based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf

This is a adaptation of Faster-RCNN : https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn <br />
**DONE**
 - Adapted to MS COCO dataset
 - Adapted to Resnet50
 - Added Mask Branch for Mask RCNN
 - Added ROIALign Layer

**TO DO**
 - Train models 
 
 **UPDATE**
 Unfortunately, I do not have the time to complete the code for this project. However, the authors have released a complete implementation of Mask-RCNN here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/tree/master/maskrcnn_benchmark.
