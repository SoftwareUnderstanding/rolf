## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
```
Python 2.7
tensorflow (>0.12)
```
### Installing instructions

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:maggie0106/Graph-CNN-in-3D-Point-Cloud-Classification.git
```
2. Install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download data       
We are using the data from 3D benchmark data set ModelNet http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/.     
The mesh polygon data format from ModelNet is preprocessed into Point Cloud format by  Charles R. Qi et al. (PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation, CVPR 2017 https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)   
Download the data and put it in the data folder from the following link: 
```
https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048.zip 
```
## Model
You can choose between two models using different pooling scheme including global pooling and multi-resolution pooling. And two training schemes have been provided to alleviate the unbalanced data, please change the batchWeight line in the model.py accordingly. 
* global pooling: no subsampling process, only aims at picking the global features.
* multi-resolution pooling: doing subsampling after each convolutional layer to shrink the graph dimension by farthest subsampling a subset of centroid points and preform max-pooling on each cluter formed by the nearest neighbor around each point in the subset.

## Run the demo
### To run global pooling model
```
cd global_pooling_model
python main.py
```
### To run multi-resolution pooling model
```
cd multi_res_pooling_model	
python main_multi_res.py	
```

## Using scope
This implementation can be used to achieve 3D point cloud classification and can be easily applied to point cloud part segmentation by simply removing the global features aggregation process to achieve pointwise classification. This model also has the potential to extend into any problem relate to the interaction between graph structure and graph signal or purely graph classification problem.
