# Deep Space

This project aims to generate space pictures using images taken by the Hubble Telescope: https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/viewall/

I use a modified DCGAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) to do so.

Here are some of the results:

### Want to run or modify it yourself?
Feel free to edit the deep-art ipynb (the structure is all in there).

To generate your own images using the trained weights, download the best-model.pt file and run the generate ipynb.

Install:
- Pytorch
- Numpy

### Please do not:
- Sell the images
- Use them without crediting me (Anand Chandra)
