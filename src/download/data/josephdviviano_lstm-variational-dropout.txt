Variational Dropout for LSTMs
-----------------------------

A simple pytorch implementation of

A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks
Yarin Gal & Zoubin Ghahramani, 2016. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287)

This is a simple version of previous implementations I found (e.g., WeightDrop
from [awd-lstm-lm](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm) and
[torchNLP](https://pytorchnlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torchnlp/nn/weight_drop.html)).


For tests and usage, please see:

```
python test_model.py
```
