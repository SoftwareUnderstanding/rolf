Inspired by combatting sexism with bots by Archana Vaitheeswaran, i set out to create a classifier to identify remarks as sexist and non-sexist. 
I have created a dataset of 800 remarks (400 in each category).
I trained it using Fastai and ULMFit - https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146 

Dataset is available on request.
