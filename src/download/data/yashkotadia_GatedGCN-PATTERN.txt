# GatedGCN-PATTERN Experiment

This reporsitory contains simplified version of the code created by Dwivedi et al available on [Github](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns).  
It contains code for a single experiment of running GatedGCN on PATTERN dataset for node classification task.  
Appropriate instructions to run the code are available on this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TRdi2TspTRDTWqlgopzPabS7lQsU1K24?usp=sharing). Please feel free to create your own copy and play with it.  
I have used the Weights and Biases Reports feature to visualize and store the results. You would have to plug in your API key to be able to use it.
