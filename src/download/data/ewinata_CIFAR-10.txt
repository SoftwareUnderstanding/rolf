# Overview
Tried different architectures and solidified deep learning and CNN understanding through implementing and training a model for CIFAR 10. It is relatively easy with online tutorials to achieve 80%+ accuracy, however, to get to 90%+ accuracy, I followed the architecture mentioned in Research Articles: <br>
