# Keras Resnext Feature Pyramid Network
Feature Pyramid Network with ResNext backbone implemented in Keras. Use this for semantic segmentation tasks.
Probably a good first step to get you up on those Kaggle competitions where everyone is still using regular Resnet FCNs ;)

Check the "Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks" paper for
info on ResNext
