# infogan-mnist
Small project used for a competition on semi-supervised classification of the MNIST dataset. With basic settings the testset accuracy should be around 95%, which is similar to the accuracy reported in the InfoGAN paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657.

To run the code run `main_infogan`. To adjust batch size and number of epochs use `--batch_size` `--epochs`.
