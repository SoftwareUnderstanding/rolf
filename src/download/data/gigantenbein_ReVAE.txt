# ReVAE
Implementation of a Variational Auto Encoders with convolutional sequences with reversible blocks as seen in the
paper by Gomes et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04585. The reversible blocks lead to less memory consumption
with a slight increase in training time.


# Setting up the environment

Install PyTorch by following the instructions on pytorch.org. For the pip packages do

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

in your project directory.
