# NeuralStyleTransfer
# References:
The Neural Style Transfer algorithm was due to Gatys et al. (2015). Harish Narayanan and Github user "log0" also have highly readable write-ups from which we drew inspiration. The pre-trained network used in this implementation is a VGG network, which is due to Simonyan and Zisserman (2015). Pre-trained weights were from the work of the MathConvNet team.
