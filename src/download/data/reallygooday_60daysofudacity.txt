# **60 DAYS OF UNMISSABLE UDACITY** 


____

## *60 DAILY DIGESTS OF THE REMARKABLE INTELLECTUAL ADVENTURE*

The immensity of the Secure and Private AI subject is infinite. Every day of the #60daysofudacity had many questions of interest, but there was no day that did not reflect the community influence. I had been privileged to be a part of it. The Udacity community rendered help far beyond any expectations. For #60daysofudacity to happen, I had been dependent on other Udacity Scholars. It made all the difference between the steady learning progress and confusion. Many tireless Udacity Scholars provided me with invaluable assistance combined with priceless encouragements and countless ideas. My appreciation is boundless.

## ***I'm Super Excited, Let's Get Started***

- **Day 1,  June 28th, Friday**: 
   - [x] Prioritising & Planning 

        Secure and Private AI Challenge content summary:
        - Differential Privacy
        - Evaluating the Privacy of a Function
        - Local and Global Differential Privacy
        - Differential Privacy for Deep Learning
        - Federated Learning
        - Securing Federated Learning
        - Encrypted Deep Learning
        
   - [x] Started from Differential Privacy and coded the examples.
   
   - [x] Let's see how I can do that. Link to GitHub repo: 
   
            https://github.com/reallygooday/60daysofudacity/blob/master/Differential_Privacy.ipynb
          
____

- **Day 2, June 29th, Saturday**: Gaining intuitive understanding about the basics of Neural Networks:
   - [x]    First Takeaway --> the term 'Logistic Regression' represents a small Neural Network and learning algorithm for Binary Classification Problem;
   - [x]    Second Takeaway --> the loss function of Logistic Regression computes the error for a single training example,
   the cost function of Logistic Regression is the average of the loss function of the entire training set);
   - [x]    Third Takeaway --> the term 'Gradient Descent algorithm' represents the slope of the function;
   - [x]    Forth Takeaway --> computations of Neural Networks organised in terms of a forward pass (or a forward propagation step),
   in which we compute output of Neural Networks, followed by a backward pass (or a back propagation step), which we use to compute gradients or derivatives.
____

- **Day 3, June 30th, Sunday**: 
   - [x]    doing the programming exercises;
   - [x]    learning about vectorization, re-writting explicit 'for' loops;
   - [x]    non-vectorize, looped code takes much longer than vectorize code;

   - [x]    link to the article:
   
                    https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-forget-for-loop-for-data-science-code-and-embrace-vectorization-696632622d5f

 ____

- **Day 4, July 1th, Monday**: 
   - [x]    read the article **'Broadcasting with PyTorch'**;
   - [x]    I allude briefly to the main points, Rules of Broadcasting -->
        - Rule 0: Each tensor has at least one dimension(trivial)
        - Rule 1: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.
        - Rule 2: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.
        - Rule 3: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.   

    - [x]   link to the article:
