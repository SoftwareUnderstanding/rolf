# CycleGAN - Tensorflow

This project is tensorflwo implementation of "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).

The above paper presents an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples.
