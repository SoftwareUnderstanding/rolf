# u2net
This is a U-2-Net Code Snippet for [U^2-Net: Going Deeper with Nested U-Structure for Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09007.pdf). 

This implementation is based on official's [repo](https://github.com/NathanUA/U-2-Net), which can also make use of pre-trained model [u2net.pth (176.3 MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ao1ovG1Qtx4b7EoskHXmi2E9rp5CHLcZ/view?usp=sharing) or [u2netp.pth (4.7 MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rbSTGKAE-MTxBYHd-51l2hMOQPT_7EPy/view?usp=sharing).
