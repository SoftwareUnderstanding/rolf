# seq-2-seq-for-neural-machine-translation-english-to-hindi-
-Data is taken from IITB english-hindi parallel corpus

-Model used in machineTranslation.ipynb is simple RNN(LSTM) encoder decoder using teacher-force

-ModelTranslation(attention) is implemented using attention mechanism + teacher-force to train model well

-attention model is based upon the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473

-Suggestions for any kind of improvement would be appreciated
