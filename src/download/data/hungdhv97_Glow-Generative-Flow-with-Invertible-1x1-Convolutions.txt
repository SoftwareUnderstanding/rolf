# Glow-Generative-Flow-with-Invertible-1x1-Convolutions
We introduce Glow, a reversible generative model which uses invertible 1x1 convolutions. It extends previous work on reversible generative models and simplifies the architecture. Our model can generate realistic high resolution images, supports efficient sampling, and discovers features that can be used to manipulate attributes of data. Weâ€™re releasing code for the model and an online visualization tool so people can explore and build on these results.
