## Introduction

Vega is an AutoML algorithm tool chain developed by Noah's Ark Laboratory, the main features are as follows:

1. Full pipeline capailities: The AutoML capabilities cover key functions such as Hyperparameter Optimization, Data Augmentation, Network Architecture Search (NAS), Model Compression, and Fully Train. These functions are highly decoupled and can be configured as required, construct a complete pipeline.
2. Industry-leading AutoML algorithms: Provides Noah's Ark Laboratory's self-developed **[industry-leading algorithm (Benchmark)](./docs/benchmark.md)** and **[Model Zoo](./docs/model_zoo.md)** to download the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.
3. Fine-grained network search space: The network search space can be freely defined, and rich network architecture parameters are provided for use in the search space. The network architecture parameters and model training hyperparameters can be searched at the same time, and the search space can be applied to Pytorch, TensorFlow and MindSpore.
4. High-concurrency neural network training capability: Provides high-performance trainers to accelerate model training and evaluation.
5. Multi-Backend: PyTorch (GPU and Ascend 910), TensorFlow (GPU and Ascend 910), MindSpore (Ascend 910).
6. Ascend platform: Search and training on the Ascend 910 and model evaluation on the Ascend 310.

## Installation

Run the following commands to install Vega:

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade noah-vega
```

## Usage

Run the `vega` command to run the Vega application. For example, run the following command to run the `CARS` algorithm:

```bash
vega ./examples/nas/cars/cars.yml
```

The `cars.yml` file contains definitions such as pipeline, search algorithm, search space, and training parameters.
Vega provides more than 40 examples for reference: [Examples](https://github.com/huawei-noah/vega/tree/master/examples), [Example Guide](./docs/en/user/examples.md), and [Configuration Guide](./docs/en/user/config_reference.md).

The security mode is applicable to communication with high security requirements. Before running this command, run the security configuration (./docs/en/security.md).

```bash
vega ./examples/nas/cars/cars.yml -s
```
