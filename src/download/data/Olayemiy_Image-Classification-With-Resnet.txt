# Image-Classification-With-Resnet

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of a Resnet-32 model as described in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) to solve Intel's Image Scene Classification. 


### Disclaimer
I have provided a trained model with 90% out-of-sample accuracy [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wNErDtbLbWxL0XUfJ75JXmT-BiytEreA/view?usp=sharing). However, feel free to train the model from scratch. \
The dependencies needed to run this notebook are Pytorch, Numpy, Tensorboard and Opencv. \
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) is the Dataset.
