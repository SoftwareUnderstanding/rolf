Objectives of ‘Plant Pathology Challenge’ are to train a model using images of training dataset to 1) Accurately classify a given image from testing dataset into different diseased category or a healthy leaf; 2) Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf; 3) Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms; 4) Address depth perception—angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf; and 5) Incorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant features during learning.

Multiple Convolutional NeuralNets were used(DenseNet, EfficientNet, EfficientNet NoisyStudent)...@SrirangaTarun
