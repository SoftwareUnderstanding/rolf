# ULMFiT
## Fellowshipai Challange using fastai.
Twitter US aiirlines sentiment airlines using Universal Language Model Fine-tuning(ULMFiT). 
ULMFiT is developed by fastai. It focuses on transfer learning in NLP. The high level architecture of ULMFiT consists of pretrained language model, our dataset language model and the text classifier.
 In their experiments they used the state-of-the- art language model AWD-LSTM with various tuned dropout hyperparameters.

 This notebook consists of detailed implementation of the ULMFiT.
