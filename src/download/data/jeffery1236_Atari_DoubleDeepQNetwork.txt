# Deep Q Network and Double Deep Q Network on Atari

This project applies ideas from research literature to solve Atari OpenAI gym environments.

## Getting Started

1. Activate conda environment with dependencies installed
2. Run atari.py

### Prerequisites

Project requires: Pytorch v1.4.0 installed
Other dependencies include:
- Numpy
- gym
- cv2

## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Deep learning Framework used along with Numpy to build Deep Q Networks.
* [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) - Provides environments to test Agent's performance

## Acknowledgments

This project was built referencing research papers on applying Q-learning with deep neural networks
