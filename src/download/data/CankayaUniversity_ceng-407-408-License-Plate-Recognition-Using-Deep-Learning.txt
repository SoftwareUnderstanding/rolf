###  Project Description:

Comparison of plate recognition systems using image processing algorithms and using deep learning methods. At the same time faster to recognize and recognize using less power. We will gather data from a certain companies database, this company is currently using image processing to recognize plate data, we will use deep learning methods to improve the efficiency and lower the power consumption of CPU compared to the current used method(image processing).
