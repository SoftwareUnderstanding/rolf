# PyContrast

This repo lists recent contrastive learning **papers**, and includes **code** for many of them.

## Paper List
Find awesome contrastive learning [paper](AWESOME_CONTRASTIVE_LEARNING.md).

## PyTorch Code
For the reference implementation of SoTA methods, (e.g., InstDis, CMC, MoCo, ...), see [pycontrast](pycontrast).

## Pre-trained Models
A set of ImageNet unsupervised pre-training models are provided. Find them in [model zoo](pycontrast/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Object Detection
Unsupervised pre-training models outperform supervised pre-training models on PASCAL VOC and COCO. Find in [detection](pycontrast/detection).
