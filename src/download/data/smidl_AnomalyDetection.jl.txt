# Anomaly Detection

Implementation of various generative neural network models for anomaly detection in Julia, using the Flux framework. Serves as a codebase for the comparative study presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05027)

Škvára, Vít, Tomáš Pevný, and Václav Šmídl. *Are generative deep models for novelty detection truly better?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.05027 (2018).

## Experiments:

Experiments are executed on the Loda (Lightweight on-line detector of anomalies) datasets that are in the experiments directory. The sampling method is based on [this paper](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/publications/emmott-das-dietterich-fern-wong-systematic-construction-of-anomaly-detection-benchmarks-from-real-data-odd13.pdf). After downloading the datasets, you can create your own using the experiments/prepare_data.jl function. For experimental evaluation, you need the EvalCurves package:
