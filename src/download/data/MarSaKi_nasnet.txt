This code is the reimplementation of "Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition",
including the training process of controller. This code contains three algorithms to search model, Random Search, 
Policy Gradient and PPO. 

## Requirements
```
Python >= 3.6.7, PyTorch == 0.4.0
```  

## Architecture Search
```
python train_search.py --cutout --algorithm RS  #use random search
python train_search.py --cutout --algorithm PG  #use policy gradient
python train_search.py --cutout --algorithm PPO #use PPO
```
Note the validation performance in this step does not indicate the final performance of the architecture. One must train the obtained genotype/architecture from scratch using full-sized models.
Also the default setting is training with 20 processes and 3 GPU. Change the processes to 10:
```
python train_search.py --cutout --episodes 10
```
or modify code in random_search.py, policy_gradient.py and PPO.py .

## Architecture Evaluation
Because of the limitation of time and computation resource, I didn't train the candidate genotypes/architectures from scratch.

## Results
```
python draw.py
```

We can see RL search is better than random search, also PPO is more stable and faster.
