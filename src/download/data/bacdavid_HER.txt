# Hindsight Experience Replay

Reinforcement learning agent based on Hindsight Experience Replay (Andrychowicz et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (Lilicrap et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). The agent was used in the *Perception and Learning for Robotics* project at ETH ZÃ¼rich with the title *Let a Robot Solve Tiling Puzzles*. Please note that this is a strapt version which excludes the PyBullet environment, a toy example based on `OpenAI Gym` (https://gym.openai.com/) has been added instead.
