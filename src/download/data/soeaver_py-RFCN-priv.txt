# py-RFCN-priv
py-RFCN-priv is based on [py-R-FCN-multiGPU](https://github.com/bharatsingh430/py-R-FCN-multiGPU), thanks for bharatsingh430's job.


### Disclaimer

The official R-FCN code (written in MATLAB) is available [here](https://github.com/daijifeng001/R-FCN).

py-R-FCN is modified from [the offcial R-FCN implementation](https://github.com/daijifeng001/R-FCN) and  [py-faster-rcnn code](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn ), and the usage is quite similar to [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn ).

py-R-FCN-multiGPU is a modified version of [py-R-FCN](https://github.com/Orpine/py-R-FCN), the original code is available [here](https://github.com/bharatsingh430/py-R-FCN-multiGPU).

py-RFCN-priv also supports [soft-nms](https://github.com/bharatsingh430/soft-nms).

caffe-priv supports [convolution_depthwise](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/5665/files), [roi warping](https://github.com/daijifeng001/caffe-mnc), [roi mask pooling](https://github.com/craftGBD/caffe-GBD), [bilinear interpolation](https://bitbucket.org/deeplab/deeplab-public/), [selu](https://github.com/HolmesShuan/SNNs-Self-Normalizing-Neural-Networks-Caffe-Reimplementation).


### New features

py-RFCN-priv supports:
 - Label shuffling (only single GPU training).
 - PIXEL_STD.
 - Anchors outside image (described in [FPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144)).
 - [ceil_mode](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/3057/files) in pooling layer .
 - Performing bilinear interpolation operator accoording to input blobs size.
 - 2017/07/31:  support LargeMarginSoftmax and cpu forward psroipooling.
 - 2017/08/04:  add Deeplab and PSPNet support.
 - 2017/08/10:  add Deform psroipooling by [lzx1413](https://github.com/lzx1413).
 - 2017/08/18:  add ROIAlign support.
 - 2017/08/27:  add [Axpy](https://github.com/hujie-frank/SENet) layer for Senet support.
 - 2017/09/04:  add [Focal loss](https://github.com/zimenglan-sysu-512/Focal-Loss)
 
 
### Installation

1. Clone the py-RFCN-priv repository
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/soeaver/py-RFCN-priv
    ```
    We'll call the directory that you cloned py-RFCN-priv into `PRIV_ROOT`

2. Build the Cython modules
    ```Shell
    cd $PRIV_ROOT/lib
    make
    ```
    
3. Build Caffe and pycaffe
    ```Shell
    cd $RFCN_ROOT/caffe-priv
    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:
    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
    
    # cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed
    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:
    make all -j && make pycaffe -j
   ```    
   
   **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!
    ```make
    # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented
    WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1
    # Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN
    USE_CUDNN := 1
    # NCCL (https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl) is necessary for multi-GPU training with python layer
    USE_NCCL := 1
    ```
    
   **How to install nccl**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl.git
    cd nccl
    sudo make install -j
    sudo ldconfig
    ```
