# ResNet_TensorFlow
This is a pure tensorflow Implemention of [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).You can refer to the code of [pytorch official version](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py).

## Requirements
Python3  
tensorflow1.12

## Pre-trained Model
You can download pretrained model weights from [BaiduYun Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1x78snWAsM6kNN94wFmSa6A). All the weights are converted from torchvision.model.resnet.
