# Question Answering System using End to End Memory Networks

This project is the implementation of End to End Memory Networks to build Question Answering System. It takes small story and query as an input and predicts a possibe answer to the query. Here we have used Facebook Babi Dataset to train the model. After training, user can give similar stories and query as input and it would give you accurate results.

## Dependencies

* tensorflow
* keras
* functools
* tarfile
* re
