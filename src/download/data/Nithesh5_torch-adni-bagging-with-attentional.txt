# ADNI classification model. ( With Bagging and Attentional Layers)

Alzheimer's disease classification. MRI data downloaded  from 'http://adni.loni.usc.edu/' site. 

In this CNN model, I have added attention layers and also included bagging techniques for better and accurate accuracy.

Model architecture refered from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00194/full research paper.
Attentional layers refered from https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521.
