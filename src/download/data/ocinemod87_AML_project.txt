# AML-project

This is the code of the final project for my course in Advanced Machine Learning at IT University.

The code is written by Domenico Villani and Anton MÃ¸lbjerg Eskildsen.

The project is meant to implement only with the basic tensorflow functions a GANs architecture following the original paper from Ian Goodfellow (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) as close as possible.
