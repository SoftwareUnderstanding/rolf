This is a project who have the aim to segment water leaks and make a measure about his status

## STATE OF THE ART
# Pix2Pix paper
We used this model to make our aplication. we donÂ´t generated a complete RGB image, we just want to a simple mask, mono class.

# Paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for BiomedicalImage Segmentation
To undertod more deeply this model we recomend read this paper about U-net model, is a kind of autoencoder optimizar to generate images end to end.
