# MagicDraw by Christian Stur

MagicDraw is aimed to become an advanced paint tool for kids or artists to develop realistic images from sketches and drawings. Sketches are turned into real photographs, realizing children's imagination and cutting down on labor for designers to focus on composition instead of meticulous details.

This software aims at producing an end-to-end system for developing custom brushes. By simple keyword input such as "landscape sand", new brushes are trained and delivered. Additionally these can be harmonized with each other to reduce artifacts.

As this procedure requires paid services, the basic functions are free. Extended features such as customized brush creation and harmonization will be priced to cover costs. If you are part of an educational facility, contact me for free extended feature access.

The image generation is inspired by https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07291.pdf and the Pix2Pix Neural Network Structure.
