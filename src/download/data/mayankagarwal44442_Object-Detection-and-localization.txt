# Object-Detection-and-localization
Object detection and localization algorithm configured for Robotic operating system(ROS). This repository contains the required services , messages needed to impregnate the package into a robotic system using ROS as it's middleware. The algorithm used caffe model of faster rcnn for object detection.

### ROS:
Robot Operating System (ROS) is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

### Faster RCNN:
Faster RCNN is an advancement over its descendants to provide state of the art object detection using Regional proposal network and ROI pooling.
