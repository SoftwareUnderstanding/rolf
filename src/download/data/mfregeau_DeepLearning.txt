# DeepLearning

This repository demonstrates a couple of Deep Learning implementations. The files in numpy are implementations of a number of
layers and optimization algorithms implemented in Python with the numpy library for understanding purposes, as part of the online course Deep Reinforcement Learning for Visual Recognition, Spring 2017, http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/. 

The DeepQNetwork script implements a Reinforcement Learning agent based on the paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"
from V. Mnih et. al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602. This agent is meant to be trained on OpenAI gym environments.
