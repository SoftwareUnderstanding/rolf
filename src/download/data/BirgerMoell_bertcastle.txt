## Current progress

### Trained model
The BERT is fine tune on Spam classification with the help of a Spam dataset found in the data folder.
The current accuracy is 98%. 

### Flask
The FLASK app serves the pretrained model to the frontend.

### Web App
Working web app in react with trained Pytorch BERT Modelfor SPAM Classifier served with Flask.

## Roadmap
- Train the model on different NLP datasets
- Create a better visualisation of input / output
- Tune neural network hyperparamets
- Serve FLASK model from server
- Generate langauge with BERT and GANs

This is where the magic happens. We just have to figure out what to do first...
