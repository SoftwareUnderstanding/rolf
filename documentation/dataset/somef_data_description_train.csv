"""**TL; DR.** Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector. It mitigates the high complexity and slow convergence issues of DETR via a novel sampling-based efficient attention mechanism.    ![deformable_detr](./figs/illustration.png)  ![deformable_detr](./figs/convergence.png)  **Abstract.** DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However  it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution  due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues  we proposed Deformable DETR  whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10× less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/duongnv0499/Explain-Deformable-DETR

"""In seismic exploration  the features of wave propagation in elastic media are studied. Processing of seismic data  allows you to determine the structure and elastic properties of the studied medium.  To obtain seismic data  a source of excitation of elastic waves and a recording system are required. In small-scale ground research  a sledgehammer is usually used as a source  and geophones as receivers.  A geophone is a device that consists of an electric coil and a permanent magnet. During the propagation of elastic waves  the magnet inside the geophone oscillates  thereby creating an alternating current in the coil. The signal is recorded for some time. The waveform is usually similar to the velocity or acceleration of the  oscillation of the particles of the medium (depending on the design of the geophone).  The figure below schematically shows the process of obtaining data. Geophones are placed on the profile with some distance from the metal plate (offset). An engineer hits a metal plate with a sledgehammer  creating an elastic wave that  propagates in the medium under study. At this time  geophones record the amplitude of the signal for some time.  Records of each geophone are called a seismic trace (1D data).  ![](examples/seismic_survey.svg)  Since the data on adjacent seismic traces have similarities in the features of the wave field  it is convenient to consider the data together. Therefore  the traces are combined into a seismogram (2D data). The trace number is  indicated on the horizontal axis  and the time of registration (in the number of samples) is indicated on  the vertical axis.  When visualizing traces in a seismogram  positive or negative amplitudes are usually indicated in black. Also   the amplitudes of each trace are normalized to the maximum amplitude of the seismogram  or each trace is normalized  individually. Waves with large amplitudes are usually clip at the threshold.  When only the amplitude  and not the waveform  is important  a seismogram can be displayed using color.  Usually a color seismogram is drawn in grayscale.  The figure below shows the equal seismograms in wiggle and color mode.  ![](examples/color.png)  Note that despite the square shape of the picture  it is not square. Usually  the number of samples in a trace is several thousand  and the number of trace is 24 or more. Therefore  when displayed in color  interpolation is used.

"""This repository has scripts and Jupyter-notebooks to perform all the different steps involved in [**Transforming Delete  Retrieve  Generate Approach for Controlled Text Style Transfer**](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1322/)   This mechanism is used for **_text style transfer_** when a **_parallel corpus_** for both the styles is not available. This mechanism works on the assumption that the text of any style is made of **two** parts: **1. Content** and **2. Attributes** . Below is a simpe example of a resturent review. ``` The food was great and the service was excellent. Content: The food was and the service was Attributes: great  excellent ``` We transfer the style of a given content in in two different ways. The first is referred to as the **Delete and Generate** approach (referred to as Blind Generative Style Transformer - B-GST in the paper) in which the model transfers the style of the text by choosing attributes automatically learnt during training. The second is referred to as the **Delete  Retrieve and Generate** (referred to as Guided Generative Style Transformer - G-GST in the paper) approach in which the model uses attributes retrieved from the target corpus to generate target sentences from the content. Below are a few examples.  **Generative a negative sentiment sentence from content (neutral) with Delete and Generate** ``` Content: The food was and the service was Output: The food tasteless and the service was horrible. ```  **Generative a negative sentiment sentence from content (neutral) with Delete  Retrieve and Generate** ``` Content: The food was and the service was Attributes: blend  slow Output: The food was blend and the service was slow. ``` The names **Delete and Generate** and **Delete  Retrieve and Generate** are based on the steps involved in preparing training and test(reference) data.  In **Delete and Generate**   we prepare the training data by removing the attribute words from the text and during training teach the model to generate the sentence given content and target style. This is trained the same way a language model is trained. Below is an example. ``` The food was great and the service was excellent. Content: The food was and the service was Training input: <POS> <CON_START> The food was and the service was <START> The food was great and the service was excellent . <END>  The food was awful and the service was slow. Content: The food was and the service was Training input: <NEG> <CON_START> The food was and the service was <START> The food was awful and the service was slow . <END> ``` Cross entropy loss is calculated for all the tokens predicted after **_\<START\>_** token. For inference  we represent target style using the same tags as used in training  and provide the content as inputs to the model. For the case of sentiment style transfer  all the positive sentiment test data sentences will have **_\<NEG\>_** and all negative sentiment sentences will have **_\<POS\>_** token before the content. Below is an example. ``` Negative test data: <POS> <CON_START> the food was and the service was <START>  Positive test data: <NEG> <CON_START> the food was and the service was <START>  ```  In **Delete  Retrieve and Generate**  we prepare the training data similar to the **Delete and Generate** but insted of target text style we specify the exact attributes to be used for generating the sentence from the content. Below is an example. ``` The food was great and the service was excellent. Content: The food was and the service was Training input: <ATTR_WORDS> great excellent <CON_START> The food was and the service was <START> The food was great and the service was excellent . <END>  The food was awful and the service was slow. Content: The food was and the service was Training input: <ATTR_WORDS> awful slow <CON_START> The food was and the service was <START> The food was awful and the service was slow . <END> ``` Otherwise the training is same as the **Delete and Generate**. During inference  to perform style transfer we need to get the attributes of opposite text style  we get it by retrieving similar content from opposite train corpus and use the attribute associated with that. Below can be a good example.     ``` Negative test data: <ATTR_WORDS> great tasty  <CON_START> the food was and the service was <START>  Positive test data: <ATTR_WORDS> blend disappointing <CON_START> the food was and the service was <START>  ```   **The process of style transfer consists of multiple steps.**   **_1. Prepare Training data_**   * Train a classifier which uses attention mechanism. Here we have used [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) classifier.   * Use attention scores to prepare data for **Delete and Generate** trainig and test.   * Use the training and testing data of **Delete and Generate** to prepare training and test data for **Delete  Retrieve and Generate** .      **_2. Generator Training_**   * We have use modified version of [OpenAI GPT](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/blob/master/examples/run_openai_gpt.py)    * Run training of **Delete and Generate** and **Delete  Retrieve and Generate** .    **_3. Generate sentences_**   * Generate sentences from the test(reference) files.  The following section describes steps required from preparing the data to running inference.

"""With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI)  multimodal emotion recognition has become a major research topic  primarily due to its potential applications in many challenging tasks  such as dialogue generation  user behavior understanding  multimodal interaction  and others. A conversational emotion recognition system can be used to generate appropriate responses by analyzing user emotions (Zhou et al.  2017; Rashkin et al.  2018). In Dialogue Conversations  the utterance by a speaker y (say) depends on the utterance/statement given previously by a speaker x. That there occurs a correlation between the sequence of utterances. This is depicted in Figure-1  where 2 speakers are conversing and there is an emotional shift visible as the conversation proceeds. <br>  ![Figure 1: MELD_about_data](MELD.PNG) <br> **Figure 1: MELD_about_data** <br>   Conversation in its natural form is multimodal. In dialogues  we rely on others’ facial expressions  vocal tonality  language  and gestures to anticipate their stance. For emotion recognition  multimodality is particularly important. For the utterances with language that is difficult to understand  we often resort to other modalities  such as prosodic and visual cues  to identify their emotions. Figure-2 presents examples from the dataset where the presence of multimodal signals in addition to the text itself is necessary in order to make correct predictions of their emotions and sentiments. Multimodal emotion recognition of sequential turns encounters several other challenges. One such example is the classification of short utterances. Utterances like “yeah”  “okay”  “no” can express varied emotions depending on the context and discourse of the dialogue. However  due to the difficulty of perceiving emotions from text alone  most models resort to assigning the majority class. <br> ![Figure 2: Importance of Multimodal Cues](MELD_fig2.png) <br> **Figure 2: Importance of Multimodal Cues** <br> We use MELD [Multimodal Multi-party Dataset for Emotion Recognitions in Conversations Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02508.pdf). The [dataset](https://github.com/SenticNet/MELD) contains the same dialogue instances available in EmotionLines  but it also encompasses audio and visual modality along with the text. MELD has more than 1400 dialogues and 13000 utterances from Friends TV series. Multiple speakers participated in the dialogues. Each utterance in dialogue has been labeled by any of these seven emotions -- Anger  Disgust  Sadness  Joy  Neutral  Surprise and Fear. MELD also has sentiment (positive  negative and neutral) annotation for each utterance. The other publicly available multimodal emotion and sentiment recognition datasets are MOSEI  MOSI  MOUD. However  none of those datasets is conversational. <br>   """;General;https://github.com/ankurbhatia24/MULTIMODAL-EMOTION-RECOGNITION

It is primarily intended for beginners in [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) for understanding the PPO algorithm. It can still be used for complex environments but may require some hyperparameter-tuning or changes in the code.  To keep the training procedure simple :    - It has a **constant standard deviation** for the output action distribution (**multivariate normal with diagonal covariance matrix**) for the continuous environments  i.e. it is a hyperparameter and NOT a trainable parameter. However  it is **linearly decayed**. (action_std significantly affects performance)   - It uses simple **monte-carlo estimate** for calculating advantages and NOT Generalized Advantage Estimate (check out the OpenAI spinning up implementation for that).   - It is a **single threaded implementation**  i.e. only one worker collects experience.

"""Question-answering problem is currenlty one of the most chellenging task in Natural Language Processing domain. In purpose to solve it transfer learning is state of the art method. Thanks to huggingface-transformers which made avaiable pretrained NLP most advanced models (like: BERT   GPT-2  XLNet  RoBERTa  DistilBERT) relatively easy to be used in different language tasks.   Original [akensert](https://www.kaggle.com/akensert/quest-bert-base-tf2-0) code was tested with different parameters and changed base models. From both implemented (XLNet  RoBERTa) the second one resulted in better score. Further improvement ccould be made by implementation of combined model version. For example it could consists of BERT  RoBERTa and XLNet.   Change of main algorithm from BERT to RoBERTa was justified by the fact that second one is an improved version of the first one. The expansion of the algorithm name is Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach  it modifications consists of [5]: - training the model longer  with bigger batches  over more data;  - removing the next sentence prediction objective;  - training on longer sequences;  - dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data.  Use of RoBERTa consequently causes the need of configuration change and implementation of RoBERTa sepcific tokenizer. It constructs a RoBERTa BPE tokenizer  derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer  using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding. Which works in that order: 1. Prepare a large enough training data (i.e. corpus) 2. Define a desired subword vocabulary size 3. Split word to sequence of characters and appending suffix “</w>” to end of word with word frequency. So the basic unit is character in this stage. For example  the frequency of “low” is 5  then we rephrase it to “l o w </w>”: 5 4. Generating a new subword according to the high frequency occurrence. 5. Repeating step 4 until reaching subword vocabulary size which is defined in step 2 or the next highest frequency pair is 1.  Values of the tuning parameters (folds  epochs  batch_size) was mostly implicated by the kaggle GPU power and competition constrain of kernel computation limitation to 2 hours run-time.  Final step was calculation of predicitons taking into acount results averaged results for folds. Weights have been assigned by empricialy tring different values. The change of particular ones was based on the prediction score. Limitation was only the summing up of weights to one. Change of arithmetic mean of folds predictions to weighted average improved results in public leaderboard from 0.38459 to 0.38798. On the other hand as the final scores on the private leaderboard showed it was not good choice. Finally  soo strictly assignment of weights caused the decrease in final result from 0.36925 to 0.36724.  XLNet was also tested (to show it  the code with it was left commented). In theory XLNet should overcome BERT limitations. Relying on corrupting the input with masks  BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons XLNet  which is characterised by: - learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order; - overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation; - integrates ideas from Transformer-XL  the state-of-the-art autoregressive model  into pretraining. Empirically  under comparable experiment settings  XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks  often by a large margin  including question answering  natural language inference  sentiment analysis  and document ranking [6].    After all public score for XLNet version was lower (0.36310) than score (0.37886) for base BERT model and was rejected.     ""In this competition  you’re challenged to use this new dataset to build predictive algorithms for different subjective aspects of question-answering. The question-answer pairs were gathered from nearly 70 different websites  in a ""common-sense"" fashion. Our raters received minimal guidance and training  and relied largely on their subjective interpretation of the prompts. As such  each prompt was crafted in the most intuitive fashion so that raters could simply use their common-sense to complete the task. By lessening our dependency on complicated and opaque rating guidelines  we hope to increase the re-use value of this data set.""[1]     """;General;https://github.com/bluejurand/Kaggle_QA_Google_Labeling

"""---  Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where an agent aims to make the optimal decision in an uncertain environment in order to get the maximum cumulative reward. Since RL requires an agent to operate and learn in its environment  it's often easier to implement agents inside  simulations on computers than in real world situations.   A common technique to test various RL algorithms is to use an existing video game where the agent learns from its interactions with the game. Video games are an ideal environment to test RL algorithms because (1) they provide complex problems for the agent to solve  (2) they provide safe  controllable environments for the agent to act in  and (3) they provide instantaneous feedback which makes training agents much faster.  For the reasons listed above  we have chosen to implement an RL agent on the classic game Snake. Snake is an arcade game originally released in 1976 where the player maneuvers a snake-like line to eat food that both increases their score and the size of the snake. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with itself. The score of the game is simply the number of food the player's collected. Since each food collected increases the size of the snake  the game gets increasingly difficult as time goes on.   We chose to use Deep Q-Learning as our algorithm to allow our agent to make optimal decisions solely from raw input data. No rules about the Snake game are given to the agent. This approach consists of solely giving the agent information about the state of the game and providing either positive or negative feedback based on the actions it takes. Our agent was more performant than we expected  showing strategy and rapid improvement after only 200 games. We will go into more detail of our results later in the paper.

However  the backbone network utilized in these trackers is still the classical AlexNet  which does not fully take advantage of the capability of modern deep neural networks.     Our proposals improve the performances of fully convolutional siamese trackers by  1) introducing CIR and CIR-D units to unveil the power of deeper and wider networks like [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [Inceptipon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842);  2) designing backbone networks according to the analysis on internal network factors (e.g. receptive field  stride  output feature size)  which affect tracking performances.  <div align=""center"">   <img src=""demo/vis.gif"" width=""800px"" />   <!-- <p>Example SiamFC  SiamRPN and SiamMask outputs.</p> --> </div>  <!-- :tada::tada: **Highlight !!** Siamese tracker is severely sensitive to hyper-parameter  which is a common sense in tracking field.

The choice of the representation is crucial for the performance of your system. Among time-frequency decompositions  Spectrograms have been proved to be a useful representation for audio processing. They consist in 2D images representing sequences of Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with time and frequency as axes  and brightness representing the strength of a frequency component at each time frame. In such they appear a natural domain to apply the CNNS architectures for images directly to sound. Between magnitude and phase spectrograms  magnitude spectrograms contain most the structure of the signal. Phase spectrograms appear to show only little temporal and spectral regularities.  In this project  I will use magnitude spectrograms as a representation of sound (cf image below) in order to predict the noise model to be subtracted to a noisy voice spectrogram.  <img src=""img/sound_to_spectrogram.png"" alt=""sound representation"" title=""sound representation"" />  The project is decomposed in three modes: `data creation`  `training` and `prediction`.

""" ![mask_visualization](./images/mask_visualization.gif)  Feature warping is a core technique in optical flow estimation; however  the ambiguity caused by occluded areas during warping is a major problem that remains unsolved. We propose an asymmetric occlusion-aware feature matching module  which can learn a rough occlusion mask that filters useless (occluded) areas immediately after feature warping without any explicit supervision. The proposed module can be easily integrated into end-to-end network architectures and enjoys performance gains while introducing negligible computational cost. The learned occlusion mask can be further fed into a subsequent network cascade with dual feature pyramids with which we achieve state-of-the-art performance.

"""This repository contains code for the [model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf) (Finn et al.) including investigation into modifying the task sampling regime. Rather than sampling uniformly  we can sample according to a probability distribution that we construct using a priority queue containing losses previously seen during training. So far the following sampling regimes have been implemented:  * Uniform (vanilla) * Epsilon Greedy (max with certain probability  random otherwise) * Weighted Sample (sample according to probability distribution given by priority queue) * Importance Weighted Sample (same as above but meta update is now weighted by importance weights) * Delta Sample (sample according to probability distribution given by change in priority queue - biases sample to parameter space in which progress has been made) * Importance Delta Sample (same as above but meta update is now weighted by importance weights)  The priority queue is essentially a mapping between parameter tuples and losses where the parameters are those governing the task distribution (e.g. in sinusoidal regression the parameters are the phase shift and amplitude scaling). Each time a task is sampled in the inner loop  the parameter associated with this task in the priority queue will be updated with the loss incurred.  So far the following tasks have been implemented:  * 2D sinusoidal regression (parameters: phase shift  amplitude) * 3D sinusoidal regression (parameters: phase shift  amplitude & frequency scaling)  Implementations for image classification and control tasks will hopefully be added soon.

"""Semantic image segmentation is a basic street scene understanding task in autonomous driving  where each pixel in a high resolution image is categorized into a set of semantic labels. Unlike other scenarios  objects in autonomous driving scene exhibit very large scale changes  which poses great challenges for high-level feature representation in a sense that multi-scale information must be correctly encoded.  To remedy this problem  atrous convolution[2  3] was introduced to generate features with larger receptive fields without sacrificing spatial resolution. Built upon atrous convolution  Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)[3] was proposed to concatenate multiple atrous-convolved features using different dilation rates into a final feature representation. Although ASPP is able to generate multi-scale features  we argue the feature resolution in the scale-axis is not dense enough for the autonomous driving scenario. To this end  we propose Densely connected Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DenseASPP)  which connects a set of atrous convolutional layers in a dense way  such that it generates multi-scale features that not only cover a larger scale range  but also cover that scale range densely  without significantly increasing the model size. We evaluate DenseASPP on the street scene benchmark Cityscapes[4] and achieve state-of-the-art performance.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/DeepMotionAIResearch/DenseASPP
"""The vanilla GAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) tries to find the Nash Equilibrium between Generator and Discriminator  and it minimizes the Jessen - Shannon Divergence at the optimal point. It is the generative model without the likelihood. However  there were some issues - GAN is very hard to train  and it is precarious. There were many proposed solutions to these problems  as mentioned earlier.  One of the breakthroughs was WGAN paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875). Rather than finding the equilibrium between two neural networks  WGAN paper tries to minimize the 1-Wasserstein Distance(WD) between two networks. Intuitively  WD is the cost function of moving one distribution to the another. As the neural network is a powerful function approximator  WGAN finds the optimal transport from the sample to the real distribution.  However  the functions we derived from the WGAN need to meet the 1-Lipschitz condition. WGAN-GP came up with one solution to impose the gradient penalty(GP) as the gradient we obtained from the point between the real data and the samples deviates from 1. This approach works quite well.    """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/wayne1123/mnist_wgan_gp

"""Agents in various operational sites have to do a vast variety of tasks and have to multitask using the tools they have.  These agents are the face of the company to a lot of customers and the customer experience provided by these agents is very important in driving customer's perception of the product and the company.  In global companies  some agents also have to service accounts of accountholders who speak other languages. So it is important that agents have multiple tools at their fingertips that enable them to do their jobs better.  In addition  better tools can drive more efficiency which can help to reduce staffing demand and drive lower costs for organizations.  This project was to develop a suite of tools (called AA for Agent Assistant) to help agents in their efforts in servicing customers.  There were 3 ML based tools that have been developed here to assist the agents in their effort:  #1 **English to Spanish translator**:  The intent of this tool is to enable agents to communicate with Spanish-speaking customers. This was built using English and Spanish datasets of multiple sentences.  It was built using natural language processing tools in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).  A sequence-to-sequence LSTM model was built using the underlying data to develop a model to enable translation.  The model's accuracy was around 80% for the test and train population.  #2 **Sentence Completion**: The intent of this tool is to enable an agent to complete their sentences after they had typed the first few words making them faster at their job.  This would be akin to how gmail completes sentences after you have typed a few words.  The same English sentences that were used for translation were used.  However  the input feature was the first few words from the English lines and the last few words from the same English line was the target for the model.  Similar to the translation algorithm  another sequence-to-sequence LSTM model was built to enable completion.  The model's completion accuracy is displayed to be ~80% for the test population  however  the proposed sentence completers are not as clear.   #3 **Chatbot to help agents**:  The intent of this tool is to enable an agent to type in a question about some credit card feature and it would then answer the question.  Using the FAQ from a bank's webpage and randomizing permutations  a chat corpus was created.  This is then used to used to train the model where a question is mapped to the intent behind the question.  Intent can range from how to apply  how to earn rewards  what is reported to the credit bureaus etc.  Each intent has a unique answer and the chatbot would respond with that answer.  The model accuracy here was over 95% primarily because the chat corpus was built around the FAQ words.  For the Translator and Completer  the execution of training and inferencing the LSTM model had to be developed separately. Given the long run-times  additional functions were developed to continue with the epoch training after a few epoch runs.  Also a set of decoding functions had to be developed to read in the text and load that into a certain form for the model's encoder and decoder to use and translate/complete.  A streamlit app was developed for all the 3 models so that AA can be demonstrated to agents and interested organizations.  Some challenges that were faced (especially for the Translator and Completer)  was that not all lines could be used due to system & memory limitations in the training process.  This limited the training of the model and the translations/completions it can come up with.  Also the model wouldn't run on a laptop and had to be run on Google Cloud Platform in order to run over a few hours.  Both Translator and Completer needed over 50 epochs which took over 5 hours to run on Google Cloud Platform.  Looking forward  the opportunity is to improve the algorithms and use more data in conjunction to improve the quality of the translation and completions.  For the chat model  the opportunity is to train the model on actual chat conversations so that it can be trained better on unseen data and develop better response.

This intuition was inspired from Monte Carlo Tree Search estimation where game is played till the end to determine the Q-Values. Instead of using a normal Q Network  a Double Q Network was used one for predicting Q values and other for predicting actions. This is done to try and reduce the large overestimations of action values which result form a positive bias introduced in Q Learning.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""**TL; DR.** Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector. It mitigates the high complexity and slow convergence issues of DETR via a novel sampling-based efficient attention mechanism.    ![deformable_detr](./figs/illustration.png)  ![deformable_detr](./figs/convergence.png)  **Abstract.** DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However  it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution  due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues  we proposed Deformable DETR  whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10× less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.   """;General;https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR

It is basically a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows.

Swin Transformer achieves strong performance on COCO object detection (`58.7 box AP` and `51.1 mask AP` on test-dev) and ADE20K semantic segmentation (`53.5 mIoU` on val)  surpassing previous models by a large margin.  ![teaser](figures/teaser.png)   """;General;https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer

This method suffers from the so-called cold-start problem: If there is a new hotel  no-one else would’ve yet liked or watched it  so you’re not going to have this in your list of recommended hotels  even if you’d love it.

It doesn’t have a cold-start problem because it works through attributes or tags of the content  such as views  Wi-Fi or room types  so that new hotels can be recommended right away.  The point of content-based is that we have to know the content of both user and item. Usually you construct user-profile and item-profile using the content of shared attribute space. For example  for a movie  you represent it with the movie stars in it and the genres (using a binary coding for example).  **There are a number of popular encoding schemes but the main ones are:**   - One-hot encoding - Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding - Word embeddings  In this project  we will be discussing content-based filtering of recommender engine  turning implicit attributes into explicit features for hotel recommender engine.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

In this paper  we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation  named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point  the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and the density functions through kernel density estimation. A novel reformulation is proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions  which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides  PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40  ShapeNet  and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides  our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

Since they use recurrence  those models can suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients which can make training and learning long-range patterns harder.  ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3gB5yUL9lqQBuEY7qFIH2A.png)  <span class=""figcaption_hack"">[Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) by [fdeloche](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ixnay) Under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)</span>  Transformers are a relatively newer architecture that can process sequences without using any recurrence or convolution [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)].

In this paper  we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation  named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point  the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and the density functions through kernel density estimation. A novel reformulation is proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions  which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides  PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40  ShapeNet  and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides  our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.

Automatically formatting a user's inputs and outputs so that the model can effectively pattern-match 2. Creating a web app for a user to deploy locally and showcase their idea  Here's a quick example of priming GPT to convert English to LaTeX:  ``` #: Construct GPT object and show some examples gpt = GPT(engine=""davinci""            temperature=0.5            max_tokens=100) gpt.add_example(Example('Two plus two equals four'  '2 + 2 = 4')) gpt.add_example(Example('The integral from zero to infinity'  '\\int_0^{\\infty}')) gpt.add_example(Example('The gradient of x squared plus two times x with respect to x'  '\\nabla_x x^2 + 2x')) gpt.add_example(Example('The log of two times x'  '\\log{2x}')) gpt.add_example(Example('x squared plus y squared plus equals z squared'  'x^2 + y^2 = z^2'))  #: Define UI configuration config = UIConfig(description=""Text to equation""                    button_text=""Translate""                    placeholder=""x squared plus 2 times x"")  demo_web_app(gpt  config) ```  Running this code as a python script would automatically launch a web app for you to test new inputs and outputs with.

Second  an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to predict the masked tokens for model pretraining.

"""Data scientists often choose the uniform distribution or the normal distribution as the latent variable distribution when they build representative models of datasets. For example  the studies of the GANs [1] and the VAEs[2] used the uniform random distribution and the normal one  respectively.  As the approximate function implemented by neural networks is usually continuous  the topological structure of the latent variable distribution is preserved after the transformation from the latent variables space to the observable variables space. Given that the observed variables are distributed on a torus and that networks  for example the GANs  are trained with the latent variables sampled from the normal distribution  the structure of the projected distribution by the trained networks does not meet with the torus  even if residual error is small enough. Imagine another example where the observable variables follow a mixture distribution  of which clusters separate each other  trained variational autoencoder can encode the feature on the latent variable space with high precision  however  the decoded distribution consists of connected clusters since the latent variable is topologically equal with the ball. This means that the topology of the given dataset is not represented by the projection of the trained networks.  In this short text  we study the consequence of autoencoders' training due to  the topological mismatch. We use the SAE[4] as autoencoders  which is enhanced based on the WAE[3] owing to the sinkhorn algorithm.

If an agent hits the ball over the net  it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds  it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus  the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.  The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own  local observation. Two continuous actions are available  corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net  and jumping.  The task is episodic  and in order to solve the environment  your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes  after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically   - After each episode  we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting)  to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores. - This yields a single **score** for each episode.

It implements the Variational Order Inference (VOI) algorithm mentioned in the paper  where the encoder generates nonsequential autoregressive orders as the latent variable  and the decoder maximizes the joint probability of generating the target sequence under these nonsequential orders. In conditional text generation tasks  the encoder is implemented as non-causal Transformer  and the decoder is implemented as Transformer-InDIGO (Gu et al.  2019) which generates target sequences through insertion.

"""UmBERTo inherits from RoBERTa base model architecture which improves the initial BERT by identifying key hyperparameters for better results. Umberto extends Roberta and uses two innovative approaches: ***SentencePiece*** and ***Whole Word Masking***. SentencePiece Model (**SPM**) is a language-independent subword tokenizer and detokenizer designed for Neural-based text processing and creates sub-word units specifically to the size of the chosen vocabulary and the language of the corpus.  Whole Word Masking (**WWM**) applies mask to an entire word  if at least one of all tokens created by SentencePiece Tokenizer was originally chosen as mask. So only entire word are masked  not subwords.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning system for semantic image segmentation built on top of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).  It combines (1) *atrous convolution* to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  (2) *atrous spatial pyramid pooling* to robustly segment objects at multiple scales with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views  and (3) densely connected conditional random fields (CRF) as post processing.  This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915). This version also supports the experiments (DeepLab v1) in our ICLR'15. You only need to modify the old prototxt files. For example  our proposed atrous convolution is called dilated convolution in CAFFE framework  and you need to change the convolution parameter ""hole"" to ""dilation"" (the usage is exactly the same). For the experiments in ICCV'15  there are some differences between our argmax and softmax_loss layers and Caffe's.

"""This work builds on the foundations laid by Irwan Bello in ""LambdaNetworks: Modeling long-range interactions without attention""  [(Bello  2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08602). Bello proposes a method where long-range interactions are modeled by layers which  transform contexts into linear functions called lambdas  in order to avoid the use of attention maps. The great advantage  of lambda layers is that they require much less compute than self-attention mechanisms according to the original paper  by Bello. This is fantastic  because it does not only provide results faster  but also saves money and has a more  favorable carbon footprint! However  Bello still uses 32 [TPUv3s](https://cloud.google.com/tpu) and the  200 GB sized ImageNet classification dataset. Therefore  we started this reproducibility project wondering: Could lambda  layers be scaled to mainstream computers while keeping its attractive properties?  In 2021 the world did not only have to deal with the [COVID-19 epidemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)  but was struck by [chip shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)  as well due to increase in consumer electronics for working at home  shut down factories in China and the rising prices of crypto-currencies.  This has decreased supply to record lows and prices to record highs. Resulting in a situation  whereby researchers  academics   and students (who are all usually on a budget) are no longer able to quickly build a cluster out of COTS (commercial off-the-shelf)  GPUs resulting in having to deal with older  less  and less efficient hardware.  No official code was released at the time of starting the project mid-March. Therefore  in order to answer the  aforementioned question  it is up to us to reproduce the paper by Bello as accurately as possible while trying to scale  it down such that it can be run on an average consumer computer.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""Animation movie studios like Pixar uses a technique called Pathtracing which produces high-quality photorealistic images. Due to the computational complexity of this approach  it will take 8-16 hours to render depending on the composition of the scene. This time-consuming process makes Pathtracing unsuitable for interactive image synthesis. To achieve this increased visual quality in a real time application many approaches have been proposed in the recent past to approximate global illumination effects like ambient occlusion  reflections  indirect light  scattering  depth of field  motion blur and caustics. While these techniques improve the visual quality  the results are incomparable to the one produce by Pathtracing. We propose a novel technique where we make use of a deep generative model to generate high-quality photorealistic frames from a geometry buffer(G-buffer). The main idea here is to train a deep convolutional neural network to find a mapping from G-buffer to pathtraced image of the same scene. This trained network can then be used in a real time scene to get high-quality results.    """;General;https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/DeepIllumination

"""This capstone project would be aimed at building an image classification model using convulated neural networks that will identify the following 4 categories of products: backpacks  clothing  footwear and watches. The source data to construct this model will be based on 20 000 images scraped from Amazon  the world's largest online retailer. Based on this  a recognition model will be used to correctly class a certain product image. Secondly  a recommendation system would be built to promote the closest matches based on a select product image.  Stakeholders will be the e-commerce companies and the user of the services themselves. It will help the company improve the effectiveness of potential transactions. It will also improve the user experience with more accuracy and also to avoid problems arising from wrongly identifying products. Often  users may want to source for similar looking items and a recommender would help to efficiently match a user's preferences to similar postings  giving rise to increased transactions and sales turnover.  The detailed solution to this would be to make use of unsupervised machine learning via neural networks in order to perform multi-classification of product categories. Dimensional clustering can also be used in order to match similar looking product images for the recommender system.  Metrics used to measure the performance would be accuracy using majority class and also compared to Imagenet pre-trained model performance  to be within 5 percentage points. Challenges foreseen would be lack of sufficient data  complex background noise or poor resolution images.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/Lester1711/DSI15_Capstone

"""This work is accepted at the PRIME workshop in MICCAI 2021.  > **Investigating and Quantifying the Reproducibility of Graph Neural Networks in Predictive Medicine** > > Mohammed Amine Gharsallaoui  Furkan Tornaci and Islem Rekik > > BASIRA Lab  Faculty of Computer and Informatics  Istanbul Technical University  Istanbul  Turkey > > **Abstract:** *Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained an unprecedented attention in many domains including dysconnectivity disorder diagnosis thanks to their high performance in tackling graph classification tasks. Despite the large stream of GNNs developed recently  prior efforts invariably focus on boosting the classification accuracy while ignoring the model reproducibility and interpretability  which are vital in pinning down disorder-specific biomarkers. Although less investigated  the discriminativeness of the original input features -biomarkers  which is reflected by their learnt weights using a GNN gives informative insights about their reliability. Intuitively  the reliability of a given biomarker is emphasized if it belongs to the sets of top discriminative regions of interest (ROIs) using different models. Therefore  we define the first axis in our work as \emph{reproducibility across models}  which evaluates the commonalities between sets of top discriminative biomarkers for a pool of GNNs. This task mainly answers this question: \emph{How likely can two models be congruent in terms of their respective sets of top discriminative biomarkers?} The second axis of research in our work is to investigate \emph{reproducibility in generated connectomic datasets}. This is addressed by answering this question: \emph{how likely would the set of top discriminative biomarkers by a trained model for a ground-truth dataset be consistent with a predicted dataset by generative learning?} In this paper  we propose a reproducibility assessment framework  a method for quantifying the commonalities in the GNN-specific learnt feature maps across models  which can complement explanatory approaches of GNNs and provide new ways to assess predictive medicine via biomarkers reliability. We evaluated our framework using four multiview connectomic datasets of healthy neurologically disordered subjects with five GNN architectures and two different learning mindsets: (a) conventional training on all samples (resourceful) and (b) a few-shot training on random samples (frugal).*    """;Graphs;https://github.com/basiralab/Reproducible-Generative-Learning

The illustration above compares the two types of attention. The efficient attention module is a drop-in replacement for the non-local module ([Wang et al.  2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971))  while it:  - uses less resources to achieve the same accuracy; - achieves higher accuracy with the same resource constraints (by allowing more insertions); and - is applicable in domains and models where the non-local module is not (due to resource constraints).

"""If you want to go somewhere regarding implementation  please skip this part.    YOLOv3 is a light-weight but powerful one-stage object detector  which means it regresses the positions of objects and predict the probability of objects directly from the feature maps of CNN. Typical example of one-state detector will be YOLO and SSD series.On the contrary   two stage detector like R-CNN  Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN may include Selective Search  Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Region Proposal Network (RPN) besides CNN. Two-stage detectors will be sightly more accurate but much slower.   YOLOv3 consists of 2 parts: feature extractor and detector. Feature extractor is a Darknet-53 without its fully connected layer  which is originally designed for classification task on ImageNet dataset.    ![darknet](/fig/Darknet.png)   *Darknet-53 architecture(Source: YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)*  Detector uses multi-scale fused features to predict the position and the class of the corresponding object.   ![yolov3](/fig/yolo.png)*(Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-53fb7d3bfe6b)*  As you can see from the picture above  there are 3 prediction scales in total. For example  if the spatial resolution of an input image is 32N X 32N  the output of the first prediction convolution layer(strides32) will be N X N X (B X (C+5)). B indicates amount of anchors at this scale and C stands for probabilities of different classes. 5 represents 5 different regressions  the  horizontal offset t_x  the vertical offset t_y  resizing factor of the given anchor height t_hand width t_wand objectness score o (whether an object exists in this square of the checkerboard). The second prediction layer will output feature maps of 2N X 2N X (B X (C+5)). And the third prediction output will be much finer  which is 4N X 4N X (B X (C+5).  Reading papers of YOLO  YOLOv2 and YOLOv3  I summarize the loss function of YOLOv3 as follows:   ![](/fig/loss1.PNG) <!-- $$ L_{Localization} = \lambda_1\sum_{i=0}^{N^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}1_{ij}^{obj}[(t_{x} - t_{\hat{x}})^2 + (t_{y} - t_{\hat{y}})^2] \\L_{Shaping} =\lambda_2\sum_{i=0}^{N^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}1_{ij}^{obj}[(t_{w} - t_{\hat{w}})^2 + (t_{h} - t_{\hat{h}})^2]\\ L_{objectness-obj} =\lambda_3\sum_{i=0}^{N^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}1_{ij}^{obj}\log(o_{ij})$$ $$L_{objectness-noobj} =\lambda_4\sum_{i=0}^{N^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}1_{ij}^{obj}\log(1-o_{ij}) \\L_{class} =\lambda_5\sum_{i=0}^{N^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}1_{ij}^{obj}\sum_{c\in classes}[p_{\hat{ij}}(c)\log(p_{ij}(c))+ (1-p_{\hat{ij}}(c))\log(1-p_{ij}(c))]) \\ L_{Scale_{1}} = L_{Localization} + L_{Shaping} + L_{objectness-obj} + L_{objectness-noobj} + L_{class} \\ L_{total} = L_{Scale_{1}}+L_{Scale_{2}}+L_{Scale_{3}}$$ -->   This is my implementation of YOLOv3 using TensorFlow 2.0 backend.

"""Recently  channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs). However  most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off  this paper proposes an EfficientChannel Attention (ECA) module  which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channelattention module in SENet  we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention  and appropriatecross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore  we propose a localcross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction  which can be efficiently implemented via `1D` convolution. Furthermore we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of `1D` convolution  determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. Theproposed ECA module is efficient yet effective  e.g.  the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs.24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFLOPs vs. 3.86 GFLOPs  respectively  and the performance boost is more than 2\% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensivelyevaluate our ECA module on image classification  object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of ResNets and MobileNetV2. Theexperimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/BangguWu/ECANet

So if you're after more on preparing different text sources for being with your TensorFlow deep learning models  it's worth checking out the following:   * [TensorFlow text loading tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/text).   * [Reading text files with Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/) by Real Python. * This notebook has focused on writing NLP code. For a mathematically rich overview of how NLP with Deep Learning happens  read [Standford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning lecture notes Part 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf).     * For an even deeper dive  you could even do the whole [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) course.  * Great blog posts to read:   * Andrei Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) dives into generating Shakespeare text with RNNs.   * [Text Classification with NLP: Tf-Idf vs Word2Vec vs BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-nlp-tf-idf-vs-word2vec-vs-bert-41ff868d1794) by Mauro Di Pietro. An overview of different techniques for turning text into numbers and then classifying it.   * [What are word embeddings?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) by Machine Learning Mastery. * Other topics worth looking into:   * [Attention mechanisms](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/). These are a foundational component of the transformer architecture and also often add improvments to deep NLP models.   * [Transformer architectures](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). This model architecture has recently taken the NLP world by storm  achieving state of the art on many benchmarks. However  it does take a little more processing to get off the ground  the [HuggingFace Models (formerly HuggingFace Transformers) library](https://huggingface.co/models/) is probably your best quick start.  ---   1. Rebuild  compile and train `model_1`  `model_2` and `model_5` using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) instead of the Functional API. 2. Retrain the baseline model with 10% of the training data. How does perform compared to the Universal Sentence Encoder model with 10% of the training data? 3. Try fine-tuning the TF Hub Universal Sentence Encoder model by setting `training=True` when instantiating it as a Keras layer.  ``` #: We can use this encoding layer in place of our text_vectorizer and embedding layer sentence_encoder_layer = hub.KerasLayer(""https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4""                                          input_shape=[]                                          dtype=tf.string                                          trainable=True) #: turn training on to fine-tune the TensorFlow Hub model ``` 4. Retrain the best model you've got so far on the whole training set (no validation split). Then use this trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and format the predictions into the same format as the `sample_submission.csv` file from Kaggle (see the Files tab in Colab for what the `sample_submission.csv` file looks like). Once you've done this  [make a submission to the Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data)  how did your model perform? 5. Combine the ensemble predictions using the majority vote (mode)  how does this perform compare to averaging the prediction probabilities of each model? 6. Make a confusion matrix with the best performing model's predictions on the validation set and the validation ground truth labels.   """;General;https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning

"""[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) is a pre-trained language model proposed by Google AI in 2018. It has achieved excellent results in many tasks in the NLP field  and it is also a turning point in the NLP field.  academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here:https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805.  Although after bert  a number of excellent models that have swept the NLP field  such as [RoBERTa](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/roberta/README.md)  [XLNet](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet)  etc.  have also been improved on the basis of BERT.  BERT-Classifier is a general text classifier that is simple and easy to use. It has been improved on the basis of BERT and supports three paragraphs of sentences as input for prediction. The low-level API was used to reconstruct the overall pipline  which effectively solved the problem of weak flexibility of the tensorflow estimator. Optimize the training process  effectively reduce the model initialization time  solve the problem of repeatedly reloading the calculation graph during the estimator training process  and add a wealth of monitoring indicators during training  including (precision  recall  AUC  ROC curve  Confusion Matrix  F1 score  learning rate  loss  etc.)  which can effectively monitor model changes during training.  BERT-Classifier takes full advantage of the Python multi-process mechanism  multi-core speeds up the data preprocessing process  and the data preprocessing speed is more than 10 times faster than the original bert run_classifier (the specific speed increase is related to the number of CPU cores  frequency  and memory size).  Optimized the model checkpoint saving mechanism  which can save TOP N checkpoints according to different indicators  and adds the checkpoint average function  which can fuse model parameters generated in multiple different stages to further enhance model robustness.  It also supports packaging the trained models into services for use by downstream tasks.   """;Natural Language Processing;https://github.com/guoyaohua/BERT-Classifier

In this environment  two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net  it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds  it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus  the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.  The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own  local observation.  Two continuous actions are available  corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net  and jumping.   The task is episodic  and in order to solve the environment  your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes  after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically   - After each episode  we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting)  to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores. - This yields a single **score** for each episode.  The environment is considered solved  when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.   """;Reinforcement Learning;https://github.com/biemann/Collaboration-and-Competition

Three versions were implemented in C  with the framework called [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) (paper: [v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)  [v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)  [v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767)).  This repo implements the Nueral Network (NN) model of YOLOv3 in the PyTorch framework  aiming to ease the pain when the network needs to be modified or retrained.  There are a number of implementations existing in the open source domain   e.g.  [eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3)  [ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3](https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3)  [ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3)  etc. However  majority of them relies on ""importing"" the configuration file from the original darknet framework. In this work  the model is built from scratch using PyTorch.  Additionally  both inference and training part are implemented.  The original weights trained by the authors are converted to .pt file.

"""SWA is a simple DNN training method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for SGD with improved generalization  faster convergence  and essentially no overhead. The key idea of SWA is to average multiple samples produced by SGD with a modified learning rate schedule. We use a constant or cyclical learning rate schedule that causes SGD to _explore_ the set of points in the weight space corresponding to high-performing networks. We observe that SWA converges more quickly than SGD  and to wider optima that provide higher test accuracy.   In this repo we implement the constant learning rate schedule that we found to be most practical on CIFAR datasets.  <p align=""center"">   <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14368801/37633888-89fdc05a-2bca-11e8-88aa-dd3661a44c3f.png"" width=250>   <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14368801/37633885-89d809a0-2bca-11e8-8d57-3bd78734cea3.png"" width=250>   <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14368801/37633887-89e93784-2bca-11e8-9d71-a385ea72ff7c.png"" width=250> </p>  Please cite our work if you find this approach useful in your research: ```latex @article{izmailov2018averaging    title={Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization}    author={Izmailov  Pavel and Podoprikhin  Dmitrii and Garipov  Timur and Vetrov  Dmitry and Wilson  Andrew Gordon}    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05407}    year={2018} } ```    """;General;https://github.com/julianfaraone/SWA

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

Data obtained in collaboration with AEMet - Agencia Estatal de Meteorología/ NWC SAF.   The aim of our core competition is to predict the next 32 images (8h ahead in 15 minutes intervals) in our weather movies  which encode four different variables: (i) Temperature from the [Cloud Top Temperature](https://www.nwcsaf.org/ctth2) or the ground [Skin Temperature](https://www.nwcsaf.org/ishai_description) if there are no clouds  (ii) [Convective Rainfall Rate](https://www.nwcsaf.org/crr3)  (iii) [Probability of Occurrence of Tropopause Folding](https://www.nwcsaf.org/asii-tf)  and (iv) [Cloud Mask](https://www.nwcsaf.org/cma3). Each image is an observation of these 4 channels in a 15 minutes period where pixels correspond to a spatial area of ~3km x 3km  and there are 11 regions of 256 x 256 pixels to provide test predictions. From these regions  5 of them contain also training and validation data for learning purposes but the other 6 only inference is requested  to assess the Transfer Learning capabilities of models.  ![Regions](/images/IEEE_BigData_regions.png?raw=true ""Train/Validation/test Regions"")  The submission format in each day of the test set is a multi-dimensional array (tensor) of shape (32  4  256  256) and the objective function of all submitted tensors (one for each day in the test set and region) is the **mean squared error** of all pixel channel values to pixel channel values derived from true observations. We note that we normalize these pixel channel values to lie between 0 and 1 by dividing the pixel channel value by the maximum value of each variable (see below).

"""This is an official implementation of [CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15808). We present a new architecture  named Convolutional vision Transformers (CvT)  that improves Vision Transformers (ViT) in performance and efficienty by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both disignes. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding  and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (e.g. shift  scale  and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (e.g. dynamic attention  global context  and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments  showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k  with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition  performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger dataset (e.g. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k  our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally  our results show that the positional encoding  a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers  can be safely removed in our model  simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.   ![](figures/pipeline.svg)   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/leoxiaobin/CvT

"""Need For Speed Underground 2 is a racing game  made by EA and published in 2004 in which the player mainly competes in races against other racers. To win a race  the player has to become first in each race. In the career mode on which we will focus  a player can also earn reputation. A larger lead at the end of the race yields more reputation. This motivates us to not only become first  but also win by the largest margin possible.  The initial idea of the project is to create an AI for Need For Speed Underground 2 that is able to beat the ingame opponents on easiest difficulty in one race in the modes 'Circuit'  'Sprint'  'Street X' and / or 'Underground Racing Leauge' ('URL'). To achieve this  we will develop a neural network to determine the lead over other opponents. With the help of this information  we can reward the AI for being in front of the other racers or punish it otherwise. Hence  we will use reinforcment learning in order to train the AI. The current plan is to utilise a (deep) neural network that uses the whole window of the game and the lead over enemies as inputs for the network. These inputs will be used to determine the most optimal button presses (outputs) to gain the largest lead.  The reason behind the limitation of racing modes is that here  the leads are constantly displayed in seconds. Moreover  they are easier to handle since in other ones  there are additional 'rules'. In the case of drag races  the player has to shift gears manually and is only informed on its over all position on the leaderboard. In addition  there is no information about leads available on the screen. For drift races  the goal is to perform drifts to obtain points. Here  the leads are displayed in points. We observe that the optimal way of driving in this mode is different compared to all other modes since the focus lies on drifting.   The goal of this project is to let a neural network drive cars and win races in the racing game Need for Speed: Underground 2. In order to achieve this task  we will use reinforcment learning in combination with neural networks. This project is inspired by the [work of the DeepMind team using the raw pixels to train a deep neural network to play Atari games](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf). In addition  at least the steering and the retrieval of the pixels will be done in a similar fashion as it was done by the YouTuber [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) (see also [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/next-steps-python-plays-gta-v/)).  <a name=""introduction""></a>  """;Reinforcement Learning;https://github.com/tlohr/nfsu2-ai

(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf)] </p>  The model can then be trained and results evaluated  which has been done for a great variety of experiments. We wanted to see if another application could be made  that of image restoration of blurry pictures. We have most likely all seen a movie or tv-series in which a spy agency needed someone to ""enhance"" a photo in order to see smaller details  with the advent of deep learning these techniques are becoming more of a reality. We wanted to see if this general architecture of pix2pix for image translation could also be used for this application to see if you could enhance your images by using pix2pix.  This blog first starts with the method of our project  what exactly is the type of data that we investigate and in what type of datasets they are stored. This is followed up by an explanation about the hyperparameter tuning that was performed and why this was important. The last part of the method is how we would evaluate our results. The method is followed up by our experiments  which also gives a sample of the data that we used as well as the result of some of our experiments  these results are then discussed in our discussion as well with our conclusion about the experiment if pix2pix can be used for image restoration.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

As an example  http://chev.me/arucogen/ website can be mentioned.   On the wave of current trends in computer vision and drone applications  we are introducing you to a project that we worked on “Landing of Drone on an object”. In general  this means making a drone land on any object by using a landing algorithm and a deep learning algorithm for the detection of an object. We choose the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm as the object detection algorithm. In this project  our final goal was to land a drone on an object. Therefore  in the first phase  we researched and found an existing solution where the drone was landed on an Aruco marker. In the second phase  we trained the YOLO algorithm to recognize an object (Banana) and modified the landing algorithm to land on that object. Then we further modified the landing algorithm to hover over an object.  In this git laboratory  all the procedures and steps needed to reach the goals of this project were written in detail. During the different phases of our project  we faced a lot of challenges. A special thanks to Tiziano Fiorenzani for whom this project was successful.

"""For ArXiv PDF / abstract tabs:  - Renames the title to paper's title automatically in the background. (Originally is meaningless paper id  or start with paper id) - Add a browser button to open its corresponding abstract / PDF page. (Originally is hard to get back to abstract page from PDF page) - Add a direct download link on abstract page  click it to download the PDF with the title as filename. (Originally is paper id as filename) - Better title even for bookmarks and the [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) plugin! - Firefox has [strict restrictions on PDF.js](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1454760). So it doesn't work well with OneTab  the PDF renaming is achieved by intercepting requests and show the PDF in a container. The bookmark works well though. - Works well with native tab search (credits: [@The Rooler](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arxiv-utils/reviews/1674567/))   - [Tab search on Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/search-open-tabs-firefox)   - [Enable Tab search on Chrome](https://www.howtogeek.com/722640/how-to-enable-or-disable-the-tab-search-icon-in-chrome/)  [Tab search on Chrome](https://www.howtogeek.com/704212/how-to-search-open-tabs-on-google-chrome/)   - [Enable Tab search on Edge](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-edge-chrome-tab-search/)   ArXiv is a really nice website for researchers  but I think it has 3 main shortages:  1. Unable to link to abstract page from PDF page if the PDF page is accessed directly. 2. No meaningful title for the PDF page  the abstract page have a redundant paper id as the prefix of the title. Bookmarking the PDF page is useless for later bookmark searches. 3. Downloading PDF requires a manual renaming afterwards.  This extension provides a solution to all of them!

"""With recent advancements in machine learning techniques  researchers have demonstrated remarkable achievements in image synthesis (BigGAN  StyleGAN)  textual understanding (GPT-3)  and other areas of text and image manipulation. This hands-on workshop introduces state-of-the-art techniques for text-to-image translation  where textual prompts are used to guide the generation of visual imagery. Participants will gain experience with Open AI's CLIP network and Google's BigGAN  using free Google Colab notebooks which they can apply to their own work after the event. We will discuss other relationships between text and image in art and literature; consider the strengths and limitations of these new techniques; and relate these computational processes to human language  perception  and visual expression and imagination. __Please bring a text you would like to experiment with!__   """;General;https://github.com/roberttwomey/machine-imagination-workshop

"""Deep convolution-based single image super-resolution (SISR) networks embrace the benefits of learning from large-scale external image resources for local recovery  yet most existing works have ignored the long-range feature-wise similarities in natural images. Some recent works have successfully leveraged this intrinsic feature correlation by exploring non-local attention modules. However  none of the current deep models have studied another inherent property of images: cross-scale feature correlation. In this paper  we propose the first Cross-Scale Non-Local (CS-NL) attention module with integration into a recurrent neural network. By combining the new CS-NL prior with local and in-scale non-local priors in a powerful recurrent fusion cell  we can find more cross-scale feature correlations within a single low-resolution (LR) image. The performance of SISR is significantly improved by exhaustively integrating all possible priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS-NL module by setting new state-of-the-arts on multiple SISR benchmarks.  ![CS-NL Attention](/Figs/Attention.png)  Cross-Scale Non-Local Attention.  ![CSNLN](/Figs/CSNLN.png)  The recurrent architecture with Self-Exemplars Mining (SEM) Cell.

"""This post describes how I used the eo-learn and fastai libraries to create a machine learning data pipeline that can classify crop types from satellite imagery. I used this pipeline to enter Zindi’s [Farm Pin Crop Detection Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/farm-pin-crop-detection-challenge). I may not have won the contest but I learnt some great techniques for working with remote-sensing data which I detail in this post.  Here are the preprocessing steps I followed:  1. divided an area of interest into a grid of ‘patches’   1. loaded imagery from disk   1. masked out cloud cover   1. added NDVI and euclidean norm features   1. resampled the imagery to regular time intervals   1. added raster layers with the targets and identifiers.  I reframed the problem of crop type classification as a semantic segmentation task and trained a U-Net with a ResNet50 encoder on multi-temporal multi-spectral data using image augmentation and mixup to prevent over-fitting.  My solution borrows heavily from the approach outlined by [Matic Lubej](undefined) in his [three](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/land-cover-classification-with-eo-learn-part-1-2471e8098195) [excellent](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/land-cover-classification-with-eo-learn-part-2-bd9aa86f8500) [posts](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/land-cover-classification-with-eo-learn-part-3-c62ed9ecd405) on land cover classification with [eo-learn](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/eo-learn).

"""CGMM is a generative approach to learning contexts in graphs. It combines information diffusion and local computation through the use of a deep architecture and stationarity assumptions. The model does NOT preprocess the graph into a fixed structure before learning. Instead  it works with graphs of any size and shape while retaining scalability. Experiments show that this model works well compared to expensive kernel methods that extensively analyse the entire input structure in order to extract relevant features. In contrast  CGMM extract more abstract features as the architecture is built (incrementally).   We hope that the exploitation of the proposed framework  which can be extended in many directions  can contribute to the extensive use of both generative and discriminative approaches to the adaptive processing of structured data.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""Convolutional Neural Networks are similar to ordinary Neural Networks (multi-layer perceptrons). Each neuron receive an input  perform a dot product with its weights and follow this with a non-linearity (here we only use ReLu).

From the input sequence we invert for the start time  the end time and the average power of only one appliance   ![](./figures/convnet_architecture.png)   Convolutional neural networks have revolutionized computer vision. From an image the convolutional layer learns through its weights low level features. In the case of an image the features detectors (filters) would be: horizontal lines  blobs etc. These filters are built using a small receptive field and share weights across the entire input  which makes them translation invariant. Similarly  in the case of time series  the filters extract low level feature in the time series. By experimenting we found that only using 16 of these filters gives a good predictive power to the ConvNet. This convolutional layer is then flatten and we use 2 hidden layers of 1024 and 512 neurons with ReLu activation function before the output layer of 3 neurons (start time  end time and average power).

To mitigate these issues  we proposed Deformable DETR  whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference.

"""<div align=center><img width=""100%"" src=""figs/FFB6D_overview.png""/></div>  [FFB6D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02242v1) is a general framework for representation learning from a single RGBD image  and we applied it to the 6D pose estimation task by cascading downstream prediction headers for instance semantic segmentation and 3D keypoint voting prediction from PVN3D([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04231)  [Code](https://github.com/ethnhe/PVN3D)  [Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av89408773/)).  At the representation learning stage of FFB6D  we build **bidirectional** fusion modules in the **full flow** of the two networks  where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. In this way  the two networks can leverage local and global complementary information from the other one to obtain better representations. Moreover  at the output representation stage  we designed a simple but effective 3D keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects  which simplifies keypoint localization for precise pose estimation.

"""Super-resolution (SR) of images refers to the process of generating or reconstructing the high- resolution (HR) images from low-resolution images (LR). This project mainly focuses on dealing with this problem of super-resolution using the generative adversarial network  named SRGAN  a deep learning framework. In this project  SRGAN was trained and evaluated using 'DIV2K'  ‘MS-COCO’ and ‘VID4’ [6] which are the popular datasets for image resolution tasks.  In total  datasets were merged to form:   1. 5800 training images  2. 100 validation images  3. 4 videos for testing  Apart from the datasets mentioned above  ‘LFW’  ‘Set5’ and ‘Set14’ datasets [6] were used to get inferences and compare the performance of models implemented in this project with the models from Ledig et al. [2].  Most of this project is built upon the ideas of Ledig et al [2]. Apart from that  I did some research on comparing the results obtained using different objective functions available in TensorFlow’s “TFGAN” library for loss optimizations of SRGAN. Different model implementations were evaluated for pixel quality through the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores as a metric. Intuitively  this metric does not capture the essence of the perceptual quality of an image. However  it is comparatively easy to use PSNR when evaluating the performance while training the model compared to mean-opinion-score (MOS) that has been used by Ledig et al [2]. To evaluate the perceptual quality of images  I have compared the generated images from both the models. This paper also proposes a method of super-resolution using SRGAN with “Per-Pix loss” which I defined in the losses section of this paper. Based on results from [2] and [5]  I have combined both MSE and VGG losses  named it “Per-Pix loss” that stands for ‘Perceptual and Pixel’ qualities of the image  which resulted in preserving the pixel quality besides improving the perceptual quality of images. Finally  I have compared the models built in this project with the models from Ledig et al. [2] to know the performance and effectiveness of models implemented in this project.

"""Data scientists often choose the uniform distribution or the normal distribution as the latent variable distribution when they build representative models of datasets. For example  the studies of the GANs [1] and the VAEs[2] used the uniform random distribution and the normal one  respectively.  As the approximate function implemented by neural networks is usually continuous  the topological structure of the latent variable distribution is preserved after the transformation from the latent variables space to the observable variables space. Given that the observed variables are distributed on a torus and that networks  for example the GANs  are trained with the latent variables sampled from the normal distribution  the structure of the projected distribution by the trained networks does not meet with the torus  even if residual error is small enough. Imagine another example where the observable variables follow a mixture distribution  of which clusters separate each other  trained variational autoencoder can encode the feature on the latent variable space with high precision  however  the decoded distribution consists of connected clusters since the latent variable is topologically equal with the ball. This means that the topology of the given dataset is not represented by the projection of the trained networks.  In this short text  we study the consequence of autoencoders' training due to  the topological mismatch. We use the SAE[4] as autoencoders  which is enhanced based on the WAE[3] owing to the sinkhorn algorithm.

The main different here with Fast R-CNN is that the later uses selective search to generate region proposals. The time cost of generating region proposals is much smaller in RPN than selective search  when RPN shares the most computation with the object detection network.

"""This class wraps around the general RL environment class to launch the CoppeliaSim with our custom scene. Additionally  in the beginning of every episode  it initialises the properties of the mating part: 2D position in the workspace (`setup_goal()` method)  as well as its colour.  The environment wrapper contains following methods:  * `get_observation()`  capture a grayscale image as an observation.  *  `distance_to_goal()`  compute the distance between the target and current position. The distance is used in reward design.     *  `success_check()`  check whether the goal state is reached. If yes  significantly boost agent's reward.     * `collision_check()`  check whether an agent collided with any object.     Episode termination occurs when the robot gets too far from the target  collides with any object in the environment or exceeds the maximum number of time steps. Those conditions are specified at the end of `step()` method and are checked at each step taken in the environment by the agent. Once the episode terminates  the whole cycle is repeated for the next episode.     One of the most exciting advancements  that has pushed the frontier of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years  is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). DRL belongs to the family of machine learning algorithms. It assumes that intelligent machines can learn from their actions similar to the way humans learn from experience. Over the recent years we could witness some impressive [real-world applications of DRL](https://neptune.ai/blog/reinforcement-learning-applications). The algorithms allowed for major progress especially in the field of robotics. If you are interested in learning more about DRL  we encourage you to get familiar with the exceptional [**Introduction to RL**](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest) by OpenAI. We believe this is the best place to start your adventure with DRL.  The **goal of this tutorial is to show how you can apply DRL to solve your own robotic challenge**. For the sake of this tutorial we have chosen one of the classic assembly tasks: peg-in-hole insertion. By the time you finish the tutorial  you will understand how to create a complete  end-to-end pipeline for training the robot in the simulation using DRL.  The accompanying code together with all the details of the implementation can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arrival-ltd/catalyst-rl-tutorial).

"""The aim of this project is to distinguish gliomas which are the most difficult brain tumors to be detected with deep learning algorithms. Because  for a skilled radiologist  analysis of multimodal MRI scans can take up to 20 minutes and therefore  making this process automatic is obviously useful.   MRI can show different tissue contrasts through different pulse sequences  making it an adaptable and widely used imaging technique for visualizing regions of interest in the human brain.  Gliomas are the most commonly found tumors having irregular shape and ambiguous boundaries  making them one of the hardest tumors to detect. Detection of brain tumor using a segmentation approach is critical in cases  where survival of a subject depends on an accurate and timely clinical diagnosis.    We present a fully automatic deep learning approach for brain tumor segmentation in multi-contrast magnetic resonance image.

"""BERT-base and BERT-large are respectively 110M and 340M parameters models and it can be difficult to fine-tune them on a single GPU with the recommended batch size for good performance (in most case a batch size of 32).  To help with fine-tuning these models  we have included several techniques that you can activate in the fine-tuning scripts [`run_classifier.py`](./examples/run_classifier.py) and [`run_squad.py`](./examples/run_squad.py): gradient-accumulation  multi-gpu training  distributed training and 16-bits training . For more details on how to use these techniques you can read [the tips on training large batches in PyTorch](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) that I published earlier this month.  Here is how to use these techniques in our scripts:  - **Gradient Accumulation**: Gradient accumulation can be used by supplying a integer greater than 1 to the `--gradient_accumulation_steps` argument. The batch at each step will be divided by this integer and gradient will be accumulated over `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps. - **Multi-GPU**: Multi-GPU is automatically activated when several GPUs are detected and the batches are splitted over the GPUs. - **Distributed training**: Distributed training can be activated by supplying an integer greater or equal to 0 to the `--local_rank` argument (see below). - **16-bits training**: 16-bits training  also called mixed-precision training  can reduce the memory requirement of your model on the GPU by using half-precision training  basically allowing to double the batch size. If you have a recent GPU (starting from NVIDIA Volta architecture) you should see no decrease in speed. A good introduction to Mixed precision training can be found [here](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) and a full documentation is [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html). In our scripts  this option can be activated by setting the `--fp16` flag and you can play with loss scaling using the `--loss_scale` flag (see the previously linked documentation for details on loss scaling). The loss scale can be zero in which case the scale is dynamically adjusted or a positive power of two in which case the scaling is static.  To use 16-bits training and distributed training  you need to install NVIDIA's apex extension [as detailed here](https://github.com/nvidia/apex). You will find more information regarding the internals of `apex` and how to use `apex` in [the doc and the associated repository](https://github.com/nvidia/apex). The results of the tests performed on pytorch-BERT by the NVIDIA team (and my trials at reproducing them) can be consulted in [the relevant PR of the present repository](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/pull/116).  Note: To use *Distributed Training*  you will need to run one training script on each of your machines. This can be done for example by running the following command on each server (see [the above mentioned blog post]((https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255)) for more details): ```bash python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=$THIS_MACHINE_INDEX --master_addr=""192.168.1.1"" --master_port=1234 run_classifier.py (--arg1 --arg2 --arg3 and all other arguments of the run_classifier script) ``` Where `$THIS_MACHINE_INDEX` is an sequential index assigned to each of your machine (0  1  2...) and the machine with rank 0 has an IP address `192.168.1.1` and an open port `1234`.

"""![ ](Figures/Introduction.png)  This paper proposes a Hierarchical Learned Video Compression (HLVC) method with three hierarchical quality layers and a recurrent enhancement network. As illustrated in Figure 1  the frames in layers 1  2 and 3 are compressed with the highest  medium and the lowest quality  respectively. The benefits of hierarchical quality are two-fold: First  the high quality frames  which provide high quality references  are able to improve the compression performance of other frames at the encoder side; Second  because of the high correlation among neighboring frames  at the decoder side  the low quality frames can be enhanced by making use of the advantageous information in high quality frames. The enhancement improves quality without bit-rate overhead  thus improving the rate-distortion performance. For example  the frames 3 and 8 in Figure 1  which belong to layer 3  are compressed with low quality and bit-rate. Then  our recurrent enhancement network significantly improves their quality  taking advantage of higher quality frames  e.g.  frames 0 and 5. As a result  the frames 3 and 8 reach comparable quality to frame 5 in layer 2  but consume much less bit-rate. Therefore  our HLVC approach achieves efficient video compression.

In this [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03572)  we propose Complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding box regression and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)  leading to notable gains of average precision (AP) and average recall (AR)  without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In particular  we consider three geometric factors  i.e.  overlap area  normalized central point distance and aspect ratio  which are crucial for measuring bounding box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely adopted Ln-norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore  we propose Cluster-NMS  where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering detected boxes and usually requires less iterations. Cluster-NMS is very efficient due to its pure GPU implementation  and geometric factors can be incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments  CIoU loss and Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g.  YOLACT)  and object detection (e.g.  YOLO v3  SSD and Faster R-CNN) models.

"""Deep reinforcement learning has made significant strides in recent years  with results achieved in board games such as Go. However  there are a number of obstacles preventing such methods from being applied to more real-world situations. For instance  more realistic strategic situations often involve much larger spaces of possible states and actions  an environment state which is only partially observed  multiple agents to control  and a necessity for long-term strategies involving not hundreds but thousands or tens of thousands of steps. It has thus been suggested that creating learning algorithms which outperform humans in playing real-time strategy (RTS) video games would signal a more generalizable result about the ability of a computer to make decisions in the real world.  Of the current RTS games on the market  StarCraft II is one of the most popular. The recent release by Google’s DeepMind of SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment) presents an interface with which to train deep reinforcement learners to compete in the game  both in smaller “minigames” and on full matches. The SC2LE environment is described on [DeepMind's github repo.](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2)   In this project  we focus on solving a variety of minigames  which capture various aspects of the full StarCraft II game. These minigames focus on tasks such as gathering resources  moving to waypoints  finding enemies  or skirmishing with units. In each case the player is given a homogeneous set of units (marines)  and a reward is based off the minigame (+5 for defeating each enemy roach in DefeatRoaches  for example).

"""What is a model? What is their role? I think a good model needs to have a good [Inductive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias)  which means it has good generalization capability to unseen example during training.  The difference between the Neural Network method of learning and other learning paradigm is that the Neural Network method learns from data by making a good representation of that data. On the contrary  many other methods learn by features that are manually selected by humans.  The Transformer model is one of the most popular representation generators of Neural Network methods of learning. Because of its general representation processing mechanism such as Attention-based learning  many recent advancements of deep learning rely on it.  So what actually Transformers do? What modules comprise Transformers? What are their implications? This is a natural question of mine as a beginner.   """;General;https://github.com/hiun/learning-transformers

In this project  we are using 409 images and around 1000 faces for ease of computation.    We will be using transfer learning on an already trained model to build our segmenter. We will perform transfer learning on the MobileNet model which is already trained to perform image segmentation. We will need to train the last 6-7 layers and freeze the remaining layers to train the model for face mask segmentation. To be able to train the MobileNet model for face mask segmentation  we will be using the WIDER FACE dataset for various images with a single face and multiple faces. The output of the model is the face mask segmented data which masks the face in an image. We learn to build a face mask segmentation model using Keras supported by Tensorflow.

"""In this work  we first point out that the essential difference between anchor-based and anchor-free detection is actually **how to define positive and negative training samples**. Then we propose an Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) to automatically select positive and negative samples according to statistical characteristics of object  which significantly improves the performance of anchor-based and anchor-free detectors and bridges the gap between them. Finally  we demonstrate that tiling multiple anchors per location on the image to detect objects is a thankless operation under current situations. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO support our aforementioned analysis and conclusions. With the newly introduced ATSS  we improve state-of-the-art detectors by a large margin to 50.7% AP without introducing any overhead. For more details  please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02424).  *Note: The lite version of our ATSS has been merged to the official code of [FCOS](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS) as the [center sampling](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS/blob/master/fcos_core/modeling/rpn/fcos/loss.py#L166-L173) improvement  which improves its performance by ~0.8%.

"""Recent techniques built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) are able to learn mappings between domains from unpaired datasets through min-max optimization games between generators and discriminators. However  it remains challenging to stabilize the training process and diversify generated results. To address these problems  we present the non-trivial Bayesian extension of cyclic model and an integrated cyclic framework for inter-domain mappings.  The proposed method stimulated by [Bayesian GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09558) explores the full posteriors of Bayesian cyclic model (with latent sampling) and optimizes the model with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. By exploring the full posteriors over model parameters  the Bayesian marginalization could alleviate the risk of model collapse and boost multimodal distribution learning. Besides  we deploy a combination of L1 loss and GANLoss between reconstructed images and source images to enhance the reconstructed learning  we also prove that this variation has a global optimality theoretically and show its effectiveness in experiments.

"""MLP Mixer is based on multi layer perceptron it does not use modern days CNN   It has two kinds of multi layer preceptrons one is directly applied to image patches   which are created original image then we transpose the layer and apply MLP layer across patches In the extreme case  Multi layer perceptron architecture can be seen as a very special CNN  which uses 1×1 convolutions for channel mixing  and single-channel depth-wise convolutions of a full receptive field and parameter sharing for token mixing. However  the converse is not true as typical CNNs are not special cases of Mixer. Furthermore  a convolution is more complex than the plain matrix multiplication in MLPs as it requires an additional costly reduction to matrix multiplication and/or specialized implementation.

In this paper  we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation  named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point  the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and the density functions through kernel density estimation. A novel reformulation is proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions  which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides  PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40  ShapeNet  and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides  our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.

"""The end goal of this project is to try and get the area of leaves from a picture. To do this  the part of the image that is the plant needs to be segmented from the background. There are many ways to do image segmentation such as thresholding the RGB values or using clustering to find patches of similar color  both of which are often paired with edge detection methods to try and find the edges of objects and only keep the pixels that are of interest. However  these methods are sensitive to different lighting conditions and often require color space transformations from RGB to HSV in order to be robust. These methods also don't determine which class the foreground of the image is a part of. However  with a segmentation neural network  there would not have to be any color space transformation of the image and it would output predictions for each class in the foreground that it was told to try and predict.  Once the image is segmented  an estimation of the leaf area could be produced by properly scaling the proportion of the image that contains the desired class to some reference object that has known dimensions. Since there are no reference objects in this data set  the goal for this project would be to get the proportion of each class in the image.

"""This class wraps around the general RL environment class to launch the CoppeliaSim with our custom scene. Additionally  in the beginning of every episode  it initialises the properties of the mating part: 2D position in the workspace (`setup_goal()` method)  as well as its colour.  The environment wrapper contains following methods:  * `get_observation()`  capture a grayscale image as an observation.  *  `distance_to_goal()`  compute the distance between the target and current position. The distance is used in reward design.     *  `success_check()`  check whether the goal state is reached. If yes  significantly boost agent's reward.     * `collision_check()`  check whether an agent collided with any object.     Episode termination occurs when the robot gets too far from the target  collides with any object in the environment or exceeds the maximum number of time steps. Those conditions are specified at the end of `step()` method and are checked at each step taken in the environment by the agent. Once the episode terminates  the whole cycle is repeated for the next episode.     One of the most exciting advancements  that has pushed the frontier of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years  is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). DRL belongs to the family of machine learning algorithms. It assumes that intelligent machines can learn from their actions similar to the way humans learn from experience. Over the recent years we could witness some impressive [real-world applications of DRL](https://neptune.ai/blog/reinforcement-learning-applications). The algorithms allowed for major progress especially in the field of robotics. If you are interested in learning more about DRL  we encourage you to get familiar with the exceptional [**Introduction to RL**](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest) by OpenAI. We believe this is the best place to start your adventure with DRL.  The **goal of this tutorial is to show how you can apply DRL to solve your own robotic challenge**. For the sake of this tutorial we have chosen one of the classic assembly tasks: peg-in-hole insertion. By the time you finish the tutorial  you will understand how to create a complete  end-to-end pipeline for training the robot in the simulation using DRL.  The accompanying code together with all the details of the implementation can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arrival-ltd/catalyst-rl-tutorial).

"""Manufacturing is becoming automated on a broad scale. The technology enables manufacturers to affordably boost their throughput  improve quality and become nimbler as they respond to customer demands. Automation is a revolution in manufacturing quality control. It allows the companies to set certain bars or criteria for the products being manufactured. Then it also aids in real-time tracking of the manufacturing process through machine vision cameras and/or recordings.   The core deliverable for this project is building deep learning image classification models which can automate the process of inspection for casting defects. I have produced a rest endpoint which can accept a cast image and subsequently run a tuned model to classify if the cast is acceptable or not.    As part of this project  I have built the computer vision models in 3 different ways addressing different personas  because not all companies will have a resolute data science team.   1.	Using Keras Tensorflow model (convolution2d) what a trained team of data scientists would do. 2.	Using Azure Machine Learning Designer (designer) which enables AI engineers and Data scientists use a drag and drop prebuilt model DenseNet (densenet).  3.	Using Azure custom vision (custom-vision) which democratizes the process of building the computer vision model with little to no training.

"""**Funnel-Transformer** is a new self-attention model that gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly  by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model  Funnel-Transformer usually has a higher capacity given the same FLOPs. In addition  with a decoder  Funnel-Transformer is able to recover the token-level deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence  which enables standard pretraining.

SO: segmentation output for the brain mask; CO: complementary segmentation output for the non-brain mask; RO: reconstruction output for the input image. These three outputs produced by the Sigmoid function are the final predictions; while all other Sigmoids produce intermediate outputs  except for the green one that is the concatenation of the summation from each intermediate layers. Best viewed in color.  *ROI and CO branches -  We take the downsampling branch of a U-Net as it is  however we split the upsampling branch into two halves  one to obtain the Region of Interest and the other for Complementary aka non region of interest. Losses here are negative dice for ROI and positive dice for Non-ROI region.*  *Reconstruction Branch -  Next we merge these two ROI and non ROI outputs using ""Summation"" operation and then pass it into another U-Net  This U-Net is the reconstruction branch. The input is the summed image from previous step and the output is the ""original"" image that we start with. The loss of reconstruction branch is MSE.*  ``` The code in this repository provides only the stand alone code for this architecture.

There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.  The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch  each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order  but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them  the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks.

Each row of the array stores a 32x32 color image. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values  the next 1024 the green  and the final 1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order  so that the first 32 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image. 	labels -- a list of 10000 numbers in the range 0-9. The number at index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array data. The dataset contains another file  called batches.meta. It too contains a Python dictionary object. It has the following entries: 	label_names -- a 10-element list which gives meaningful names to the numeric labels in the labels array described above.

The task of unsupervised image classification remains an important  and open challenge in computer vision. Several recent approaches have tried to tackle this problem in an end-to-end fashion.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.  <details open> <summary>Major features</summary>  - **Modular Design**    We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.  - **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**    The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks  *e.g.* Faster RCNN  Mask RCNN  RetinaNet  etc.  - **High efficiency**    All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases  including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)  [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).  - **State of the art**    The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team  who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018  and we keep pushing it forward. </details>   Apart from MMDetection  we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research  which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

"""This is an official pytorch implementation of [*Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09212).  In this work  we are interested in the human pose estimation problem with a focus on learning reliable high-resolution representations. Most existing methods **recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations** produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead  our proposed network **maintains high-resolution representations** through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage  gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages  and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks **in parallel**. We conduct **repeated multi-scale fusions** such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over  leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result  the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. </br>  ![Illustrating the architecture of the proposed HRNet](/figures/hrnet.png)  """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/baoshengyu/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch

Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.

"""Pegasus is a large Transformer-based encoder-decoder model with a new pre-training objective which is adapted to abstractive summarization. More specifically  the pre-training objective  called ""Gap Sentence Generation (GSG)""  consists of masking important sentences from a document and generating these gap-sentences.  On the other hand  the Longformer is a Transformer which replaces the full-attention mechanism (quadratic dependency) with a novel attention mechanism which scale linearly with the input sequence length. Consequently  Longformer can process sequences up to 4 096 tokens long (8 times longer than BERT which is limited to 512 tokens).  This project plugs Longformer's attention mechanism to Pegasus in order to perform abstractive summarization on long documents. The conversion is done in loading_scripts/Pegasus_to_4k.py which enables Pegasus to process sequences up to 4 096 tokens long (rather than 512 tokens). Note that the `max_pos` parameter can be changed to accept even longer sequences (e.g `max_pos=16384`). The new Pegasus model is then fine-tuned on BigPatent dataset. To assess the model's performance on long documents  all training examples are filtered such that they have a minimum length of 4000 tokens.   This project was built using HuggingFace's Transformers library. The model is trained using model partitioning (with fairscale) and parallel batch processing on a cluster of 8 GPUs.

"""The traditional methods of estimating uncertainties were mainly Bayesian methods. Bayesian methods should introduce the preor to estimate the distribution of the posteror. But DNN has too many parameters  so it's hard to calculate. So there are also non-bayesian methods that are most famous for modelling methods.  This method learns several DNNs to obtain an uncertainty with different degrees of prediction.  This method has a large computational cost because it requires the learning of several models.  Other methods have problems that cannot be measured by distinguishing between an entity's data from an entity's internal uncertainty.  Solve these problems using SDE-Net. SDE-Net alternates between drift net and diffuse net.  The drift net increases the accuracy of the prediction and allows the measurement of the analistic entity  and the epistemical entity is measured with the diffusion net.

"""BERT-base and BERT-large are respectively 110M and 340M parameters models and it can be difficult to fine-tune them on a single GPU with the recommended batch size for good performance (in most case a batch size of 32).  To help with fine-tuning these models  we have included several techniques that you can activate in the fine-tuning scripts [`run_classifier.py`](./examples/run_classifier.py) and [`run_squad.py`](./examples/run_squad.py): gradient-accumulation  multi-gpu training  distributed training and 16-bits training . For more details on how to use these techniques you can read [the tips on training large batches in PyTorch](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) that I published earlier this month.  Here is how to use these techniques in our scripts:  - **Gradient Accumulation**: Gradient accumulation can be used by supplying a integer greater than 1 to the `--gradient_accumulation_steps` argument. The batch at each step will be divided by this integer and gradient will be accumulated over `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps. - **Multi-GPU**: Multi-GPU is automatically activated when several GPUs are detected and the batches are splitted over the GPUs. - **Distributed training**: Distributed training can be activated by supplying an integer greater or equal to 0 to the `--local_rank` argument (see below). - **16-bits training**: 16-bits training  also called mixed-precision training  can reduce the memory requirement of your model on the GPU by using half-precision training  basically allowing to double the batch size. If you have a recent GPU (starting from NVIDIA Volta architecture) you should see no decrease in speed. A good introduction to Mixed precision training can be found [here](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) and a full documentation is [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html). In our scripts  this option can be activated by setting the `--fp16` flag and you can play with loss scaling using the `--loss_scale` flag (see the previously linked documentation for details on loss scaling). The loss scale can be zero in which case the scale is dynamically adjusted or a positive power of two in which case the scaling is static.  To use 16-bits training and distributed training  you need to install NVIDIA's apex extension [as detailed here](https://github.com/nvidia/apex). You will find more information regarding the internals of `apex` and how to use `apex` in [the doc and the associated repository](https://github.com/nvidia/apex). The results of the tests performed on pytorch-BERT by the NVIDIA team (and my trials at reproducing them) can be consulted in [the relevant PR of the present repository](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/pull/116).  Note: To use *Distributed Training*  you will need to run one training script on each of your machines. This can be done for example by running the following command on each server (see [the above mentioned blog post]((https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255)) for more details): ```bash python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=$THIS_MACHINE_INDEX --master_addr=""192.168.1.1"" --master_port=1234 run_classifier.py (--arg1 --arg2 --arg3 and all other arguments of the run_classifier script) ``` Where `$THIS_MACHINE_INDEX` is an sequential index assigned to each of your machine (0  1  2...) and the machine with rank 0 has an IP address `192.168.1.1` and an open port `1234`.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""This tutorial implements [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generati) paper  which introduced Conditional Variational Auto-encoders in 2015  using Pyro PPL.  Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision.  Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided  the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations.  In this work  Kihyuk Sohn  Honglak Lee and Xinchen Yan develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables.  The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes  and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference.  They called the model Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE).  The CVAE is a conditional directed graphical model whose input observations modulate the prior on Gaussian latent variables that generate the outputs.  It is trained to maximize the conditional marginal log-likelihood.  The authors formulate the variational learning objective of the CVAE in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB).  In experiments  they demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVAE in comparison to the deterministic neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output predictions using stochastic inference.  Here  we will implement their proof of concept: an artificial experimental setting for structured output prediction using MNIST database.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/ucals/cvae

"""Bounding box regression is the crucial step in object detection. In existing methods  while $\ell_n$-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box regression  it is not tailored to the evaluation metric  i.e.  Intersection over Union (IoU). Recently  IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric  but still suffer from the problems of slow convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper  we propose a Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box and the target box  which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU losses. Furthermore  this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding box regression  i.e.  overlap area  central point distance and aspect ratio  based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed  thereby leading to faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms  e.g.  YOLO v3  SSD and Faster RCNN  we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover  DIoU can be easily adopted into non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion  further boosting performance improvement.    """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU

"""There are numerous other things that I have learned and failed through so far. I went into this semester with barely any knowledge of anything in this realm  and I really feel like I have learned a lot up to now  and am excited to continue to learn more and more.  The first few weeks of my semester were spent trying to learn and understand the mathematics and qualities that modern day style transfer is based off of. I read a few of the dominant papers in the field that discussed the methods.  To summarize  when creating a stylized image  there are three main players. The content photo (c)  the style photo (s)  and the new pistache (p).  At a high level  we want to make (p) as similar in content to (c)  and as similar in style to (s). So how can we define  what ‘content’ and ‘style’ are? [4] found that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’s)  when trained for object recognition  extract different types of information at different layers. If you then try to minimize the feature reconstruction for particular layers  you can extract different information. Importantly  minimizing early layers in the CNN seems to capture the texture and color images  whereas  minimizing higher layers in the CNN seem to capture image content and overall spatial structure [5].  There is a lot of math that is involved in reconstructing those layers  and minimizing the differences between images  that I won’t get into here. After the initial paper was published  an important addition was made that enabled the creation of the Android application that I ended up editing. [5] demonstrated a way of not only creating stylized images  but also creating them in real time. To create the pistache in [4]  there was both a forward and backward pass through a pretrained network. To fix the problem of speed  [5] trained a different neural network to quickly approximate solutions to their problem.  Finally  [6] resolved an issue that allowed you to use the same network for N distinct styles instead of 1  thus saving a ton of space. This allowed the Google Codelab to contain so many distinct styles  as well as allow some of the more well known style transfer apps  like Prisma to work.    A pistache is an artistic work that imitates the style of another one.  This git repo is the culumination of half a semester of work for my independent study. To date  I have edited android app  by implemented image-segmented background blurring  and increased luminance matching to a Google Codelab [1]  that focuses on creating pistaches.  After getting to this point  and remembering that this independent study was supposed to be about machine learning and art  and I hadn’t made any art projects  I began to think about what I wanted to make with this unique application.  I quickly realized that my moms birthday was coming up  and that I have historically never gotten her anything. For those who don’t know my mom  I personally believe that she has a manic addiction to her children. That belief is entirely centered around the life she wishes to portray through her Facebook.  Facebook photos tell your story  either intentionally or unintentionally  to everyone that kinda knows you.  Either way  in deciding how to celebrate the birth of my mom  I came to the conclusion that I wanted to tell her story. The one she tells through Facebook that is. It isn’t necessarily the story I would have chosen to portray  but it’s the one she has.  So  I had the pleasure of scouring Janice’s photos to build my collage  and I grew increasingly fearful for my privacy in the process. Regardless  I grabbed about 60 photos from her Facebook (and some others I wanted to throw in)  and created 26 different pistaches with styles ranging from Picasso to Van Gogh  resulting in over 1500 total photos.  Then  I went through the 26 pistaches for each of the 60 images  and chose the one that I thought most truly represented that memory to me. The photo that I think best captures that frozen moment. Thus  trying to portray how I view the world that she is portraying. Seeing her world through my eyes.  Also  for fun  I took all 1500 photos and put it in a super-collage  I call the meg. That photo is 170MB. That image is fucking awesome! But I had to scale down the image so I can have it on github. So the resolution is wack. But I have the real version and its literally the best thing ever.  <p align=""center"">  <img src=""scaled_down_mega_collage.jpg?""> </p>   """;General;https://github.com/chrismgeorge/Artistic_Additions_To_Style_Transfer

The Box-World environment used in this script can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/mavischer/Box-World).  Training is performed in `a2c_fast.py`. The implementation is based on [this repo](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail) which turned out to be more clever and substantially faster than my own implementation `a2c_dist.py`. However this latter file contains routines to plot the gradients in the network and the computation graph.  The relational module and general architecture are both implemented as `torch.nn.Module` in `attention_module.py`. However  `a2c_fast.py` uses almost identical adaptations of these classes in `helper/a2c_ppo_acktr/model.yml` that comply with the training algorithm's `Policy` class.  An example YAML config file parsed from the arguments is `configs/exmpl_config.yml`. Training  the environment and network can be parameterized there. A copy of the loaded configuration file will be saved with checkpoints and logs for documentation.  A suitable environment can be created e.g. by  `conda env create -f environment.yml` or   `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Afterwards install and register the [Box-World environment](https://github.com/mavischer/Box-World) by cloning the repo and `pip install -e gym-boxworld`. *Remember that after changing the code you need to re-register the environment before the changes become effective.* You can find the details of state space  action space and reward structure there.  `visualize_results.ipynb` contains some plotting functionality.

"""DFNet introduce **Fusion Block** for generating a flexible alpha composition map to combine known and unknown regions. It builds a bridge for structural and texture information  so that information in known region can be naturally propagated into completion area. With this technology  the completion results will have smooth transition near the boundary of completion area.  Furthermore  the architecture of fusion block enable us to apply **multi-scale constraints**. Multi-scale constrains improves the performance of DFNet a lot on structure consistency.

"""<img src=""./fig/fig.png"" width=""1000"">  X3D is an efficient video architecture  searched/optimized for learning video representations. Here  the author expands a tiny base network along axes: space and time (of the input)  width and depth (of the network)  optimizing for the performace at a given complexity (params/FLOPs). It further relies on depthwise-separable 3D convolutions [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)  inverted-bottlenecks in residual blocks [[2]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Sandler_MobileNetV2_Inverted_Residuals_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)  squeeze-and-excitation blocks [[3]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Hu_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)  swish (soft) activations [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941;%20http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941.pdf) and sparse clip sampling (at inference) to improve its efficiency.  Multigrid training is a mechanism to train video architectures efficiently. Instead of using a fixed batch size for training  this method proposes to use varying batch sizes in a defined schedule  yet keeping the computational budget approximately unchaged by keeping `batch x time x height x width` a constant. Hence  this follows a coarse-to-fine training process by having lower spatio-temporal resolutions at higher batch sizes and vice-versa. In contrast to conventioanl training with a fixed batch size  Multigrid training benefit from 'seeing' more inputs during a training schedule at approximately the same computaional budget.  Our implementaion achieves 62.62% Top-1 accuracy (3-view) on Kinetics-400 when trained for ~200k iterations from scratch (a 4x shorter schedule compared to the original  when adjusted with the linear scaling rule [[5]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf%5B3%5D%20ImageNet))  which takes only ~2.8 days on 4 Titan RTX GPUs. This is much faster than previous Kinetics-400 training schedules on a single machine. Longer schedules can achieve SOTA results. We port and include the weights trained by FAIR for a longer schedule on 128 GPUs  which achieves 71.48% Top-1 accuracy (3-view) on Kinetics-400. This can be used for fine-tuning on other datasets. For instance  we can train on Charades classification (35.01% mAP) and localization (17.71% mAP) within a few hours on 2 Titan RTX GPUs. All models and training logs are included in the repository.   Note: the Kinetics-400 dataset that we trained on contains ~220k (~240k) training and ~17k (~20k) validation clips compared to (original dataset) due to availability.

"""Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) are a natural extension of CNNs to tackle per pixel prediction problems such as semantic image segmentation. FCNs add upsampling layers to standard CNNs to recover the spatial resolution of the input at the output layer. In  order to compensate for the resolution loss induced by pooling layers  FCNs introduce skip connections between their downsampling  and upsampling paths. Skip connections help the upsampling path recover fine-grained information from the downsampling layers.  One evolution of CNNs are [Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (ResNets). ResNets are designed to ease the training of  very deep networks by introducing a residual block that sums the non-linear transformation of the input and its identity mapping.  The identity mapping is implemented by means of a shortcut connection. ResNets can be extended to work as FCNs. ResNets incorporate  shortcut paths to FCNs and increase the number of connections within a network. This additional shortcut paths improve the segmentation  accuracy and also help the network to converge faster.  Recently another CNN architecture called [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) has been introduced. DenseNets are built from  *dense blocks* and pooling operations  where each dense block is an iterative concatenation of previous feature maps. This architecture  can be seen as an extension of ResNets  which performs iterative summation of previous feature maps. The result of this modification  is that DenseNets are more efficient in there parameter usage.  The [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326) paper extends DenseNets to work as FCNs by adding an upsampling  path to recover the full input resolution.

Given that domain adaptation is closely related to semi-supervised learning---both study how to exploit unlabeled data---we also incorporate components that support research for the latter.  Why the name ""Dassl""? Dassl combines the initials of domain adaptation (DA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL)  which sounds natural and informative.  Dassl has a modular design and unified interfaces  allowing fast prototyping and experimentation of new DA/DG/SSL methods. With Dassl  a new method can be implemented with only a few lines of code.

We don't provide detailed documentations for Dassl  unlike another [project](https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/deep-person-reid/) of ours.

By performing fast object detection frame-by-frame  all of the previous  timestep information is lost  and each timestep is just a brand-new image to the   object detection algorithm. The goal of this project was to investigate the   incorporation of previous timestep information to increase object detection   in video data. This project also provides code for performing object detection  on video data.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/RichardMathewsII/YOLBO

"""This is a PyTorch implementation of the autofocus convolutional layer proposed for semantic segmentation with the objective of enhancing the capabilities of neural networks for multi-scale processing. Autofocus layers adaptively change the size of the effective receptive field  based on the processed context to generate more powerful features. The proposed autofocus layer can be easily integrated into existing networks to improve a model's representational power.   Here we apply the autofocus convolutional layer to deep neural networks for 3D semantic segmentation. We run experiments on the [Brain Tumor Image Segmentation dataset (BRATS2015)](https://www.smir.ch/BRATS/Start2015) as an example to show how the models work. In addition  we also implement a series of deep learning based models used for 3D Semantic Segmentation.

"""This project consists of a simulation that simulates a partially observable  multi-agent  dynamic  continuous in space  discrete in time and partly unknown (missing knowledge about laws of physics) environment.  There are two actors that can interact consciously with the environment: a cow and wolf.  Additionally  there is another entity called grass.  Each entity has a certain energy level. The cow gets energy by touching grass  the wolf by touching cows. Each entity loses energy by touching its counterpart or moving around. The goal of each actor is to obtain as much energy as possible. If the energy level of the cow or the grass drops below zero the environment is reset. An actor perceives its environment  by sending out rays with a limited reach.  The rays return the color of the actor they intersect with  black if they intersected with the game border or white if they did not intersect with anything. The next figure shows a visualisation of the rays  the cow (brown)  the wolf (blue)  the grass (red) and a visualisation of the rays.  ![figure1](screenshot.png)  The little black circles represent their head.

"""Torch implementation of the deep relational architecture from the paper [""Relational Deep Reinforcement Learning""](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01830.pdf) together with (synchronous) advantage-actor-critic training as discussed for example [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783).  The Box-World environment used in this script can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/mavischer/Box-World).  Training is performed in `a2c_fast.py`. The implementation is based on [this repo](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail) which turned out to be more clever and substantially faster than my own implementation `a2c_dist.py`. However this latter file contains routines to plot the gradients in the network and the computation graph.  The relational module and general architecture are both implemented as `torch.nn.Module` in `attention_module.py`. However  `a2c_fast.py` uses almost identical adaptations of these classes in `helper/a2c_ppo_acktr/model.yml` that comply with the training algorithm's `Policy` class.  An example YAML config file parsed from the arguments is `configs/exmpl_config.yml`. Training  the environment and network can be parameterized there. A copy of the loaded configuration file will be saved with checkpoints and logs for documentation.  A suitable environment can be created e.g. by  `conda env create -f environment.yml` or   `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Afterwards install and register the [Box-World environment](https://github.com/mavischer/Box-World) by cloning the repo and `pip install -e gym-boxworld`. *Remember that after changing the code you need to re-register the environment before the changes become effective.* You can find the details of state space  action space and reward structure there.  `visualize_results.ipynb` contains some plotting functionality.

"""**Robustness problem in neural networks:** Neural networks deployed in the real-world will encounter data with naturally occurring distortions  e.g. motion blur  brightness changes  etc. Such changes make up shifts from the training data distribution. While neural networks are able to learn complex functions in-distribution  their predictions are deemed unreliable under such shifts  i.e. they are not robust. This presents a core challenge that needs to be solved for these models to be useful in the real-world.  **Why do we need robust predictions?** Suppose we want to learn a mapping from an input domain  e.g. RGB images  to a target domain  e.g. surface normals (see above figure). A common approach is to learn this mapping with a `direct` path  i.e. `RGB → surface normals`. Since this path directly operates on the input domain  it is prone to being affected by any slight alterations in the RGB image  e.g. brightness changes.   **How do we obtain robust predictions?** An alternative can be to go through a **middle domain** that is invariant to that change. For example  the surface normals predicted via the `RGB → 2D edges → surface normals` path will be resilient to brightness distortions in the input as the 2D edges domain abstracts that away. However  the distortions that a model may encounter are broad and unknown ahead of time  and some middle domains can be too lossy for certain downstream predictions. These issues can be mitigated by employing an **ensemble** of predictions made via a **diverse set of middle domains** and merging their (relatively weaker) predictions into one (stronger) output on-the-fly.

"""Optax is a gradient processing and optimization library for JAX.  Optax is designed to facilitate research by providing building blocks that can be easily recombined in custom ways.  Our goals are to:  *   Provide simple  well-tested  efficient implementations of core components. *   Improve research productivity by enabling to easily combine low level     ingredients into custom optimisers (or other gradient processing components). *   Accelerate adoption of new ideas by making it easy for anyone to contribute.  We favour focusing on small composable building blocks that can be effectively combined into custom solutions. Others may build upon these basic components more complicated abstractions. Whenever reasonable  implementations prioritise readability and structuring code to match standard equations  over code reuse.  An initial prototype of this library was made available in JAX's experimental folder as `jax.experimental.optix`. Given the wide adoption across DeepMind of `optix`  and after a few iterations on the API  `optix` was eventually moved out of `experimental` as a standalone open-source library  renamed `optax`.

"""In this work we have shown how to augment an images training using rotations. Furthermore  we have presented the convolutional neural network SegNet which yields a fairly good prediction for road segmentation on satellite images. However  one must pay attention to overfitting very carefully.    The goal of this work is to segment roads on satellite images (Figure 1) by using machine learning techniques. In other words  we want to assign a label (road or background) to each pixel of the image. Before selecting the best algorithm  an effort is made on how to augment a small image data set and how to get the most relevant features out of it. Then we present 2 different classes of algorithm. The first one is a linear logistic regression whereas the second one  called SegNet [1] uses a more complicated scheme based on a convolutional neural network (CNN).  ![Fig1. Exampel of satellite image ](projectRoadSegmentation/report/pics/satImage.png)  Fig1. Exampel of satellite image   A set of N = 100 training images of size 400 × 400 pixels is provided. The set contains different aerial pictures of urban areas. Together with this training set  the Figure 2. Ground truth of satellite image example. corresponding ground truth grayscale images (Figure 2) are also available. Note that the ground truth images need to be converted into label images. Concretely  each pixel y i can only take one of the two possible values corresponding to the classes: road label (y i = 1) or background label (y i = 0). In order to binarize the ground truth images  a threshold of 25% is set. This means that every pixel with an intensity lower than 75% of the maximum possible value is set to 0 and the rest is set to 1. With 8 bits images  the maximum value is 255 which sets the threshold to 191. This pixel threshold has a direct impact on the width of the road label in the computed label image.    ![Fig2. Ground truth of satellite image example ](projectRoadSegmentation/report/pics/satImage_gt.png)    Fig2. Ground truth of satellite image example     The problem that arises with such a small training set (100 images only) is overfitting. Moreover in order to train any convolutional neural network properly it is necessary to augment the dataset. Analysing the training set  it is obvious that it contains mainly pictures with strictly vertical and horizontal roads. For that reason  creating new images by rotating the original ones allows to increase the size of the dataset and generates data which will be useful to better train the algorithm. Specifically  we rotate each image by angles going from 5 to 355 degrees every 5 degrees (i.e. 5  10  15 ...  355). That way we generate a set of images with roads in every directions. In summary  for each image of the original training set  70 images are generated using therotations  resulting in a new training set of 7100 images. This augmented training set is then suitable for the training of the CNN.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/gaelmoccand/RoadSegmentation_CNN

They belong to a set of algorithms called generative models  which are widely used for unupervised learning tasks which aim to learn the uderlying structure of the given data. As the name suggests GANs allow you to generate new unseen data that mimic the actual given real data. However  GANs pose problems in training and require carefullly tuned hyperparameters.This paper aims to solve this problem.  DCGAN is one of the most popular and succesful network design for GAN. It mainly composes of convolution layers  without max pooling or fully connected layers. It uses strided convolutions and transposed convolutions  for the downsampling and the upsampling respectively.  **Generator architecture of DCGAN** <p align=""center""> <img src=""images/Generator.png"" title=""DCGAN Generator"" alt=""DCGAN Generator""> </p>  **Network Design of DCGAN:** * Replace all pooling layers with strided convolutions. * Remove all fully connected layers. * Use transposed convolutions for upsampling. * Use Batch Normalization after every layer except after the output layer of the generator and the input layer of the discriminator. * Use ReLU non-linearity for each layer in the generator except for output layer use tanh. * Use Leaky-ReLU non-linearity for each layer of the disciminator excpet for output layer use sigmoid.

"""This is an official implementation of [CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15808). We present a new architecture  named Convolutional vision Transformers (CvT)  that improves Vision Transformers (ViT) in performance and efficienty by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both disignes. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding  and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (e.g. shift  scale  and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (e.g. dynamic attention  global context  and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments  showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k  with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition  performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger dataset (e.g. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k  our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally  our results show that the positional encoding  a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers  can be safely removed in our model  simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.   ![](figures/pipeline.svg)   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/microsoft/CvT

"""This code provides a framework to easily add architectures and datasets  in order to  train and deploy CNNs for a robot. It contains a full training pipeline in python using Tensorflow and OpenCV  and it also some C++ apps to deploy a frozen protobuf in ROS and standalone. The C++ library is made in a way which allows to add other backends (such as TensorRT and MvNCS)  but only Tensorflow and TensorRT are implemented for now. For now  we will keep it this way because we are mostly interested in deployment for the Jetson and Drive platforms  but if you have a specific need  we accept pull requests!  The networks included is based of of many other architectures (see below)  but not exactly a copy of any of them. As seen in the videos  they run very fast in both GPU and CPU  and they are designed with performance in mind  at the cost of a slight accuracy loss.

In order to build and run this image with support for X11 (to display the results)  you can run this in the repo root directory ([nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) should be used instead of vainilla docker):  ```sh   $ docker pull tano297/bonnet:cuda9-cudnn7-tf17-trt304   $ nvidia-docker build -t bonnet .   $ nvidia-docker run -ti --rm -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/developer/.Xauthority -v /home/$USER/data:/shared --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host bonnet /bin/bash ```  _-v /home/$USER/data:/share_ can be replaced to point to wherever you store the data and trained models  in order to include the data inside the container for inference/training.

"""DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning system for semantic image segmentation built on top of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).  It combines (1) *atrous convolution* to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  (2) *atrous spatial pyramid pooling* to robustly segment objects at multiple scales with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views  and (3) densely connected conditional random fields (CRF) as post processing.  This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915). This version also supports the experiments (DeepLab v1) in our ICLR'15. You only need to modify the old prototxt files.

"""Data augmentation (DA) plays a critical role in improving the generalization of deep learning models. Recent works on automatically searching for DA policies from data have achieved great success. However  existing automated DA methods generally perform the search at the image level  which limits the exploration of diversity in local regions. In this paper  we propose a more fine-grained automated DA approach  dubbed Patch AutoAugment  to divide an image into a grid of patches and search for the joint optimal augmentation policies for the patches. We formulate it as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem  where each agent learns an augmentation policy for each patch based on its content together with the semantics of the whole image. The agents cooperate with each other to achieve the optimal augmentation effect of the entire image by sharing a team reward. We show the effectiveness of our method on multiple benchmark datasets of image classification and fine-grained image recognition (e.g.  CIFAR-10  CIFAR-100  ImageNet  CUB-200-2011  Stanford Cars and FGVC-Aircraft). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DA methods while requiring fewer computational resources. <div align=center> <img src=https://github.com/LinShiqi047/PatchAutoAugment/blob/main/figure/PAA.png /> </div>   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/LinShiqi047/PatchAutoAugment

"""DenseNet is a network architecture where each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion (within each *dense block*).

"""* **What:**    * The authors propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial    networks  borrowing from style transfer literature    * The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms    of traditional distribution quality metrics   * The authors propose two new  automated methods to quantify interpolation quality    and disentanglement  that are applicable to any generator architecture   * The authors introduce a new  highly varied and high-quality dataset of    human faces The (FFHQ  Flickr-Faces-HQ).    * The authors proposed the way to control different features of the generated image and made   the model more explainable. See theirs official video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA&feature=youtu.be) * **Method:**  The idea of creating Mapping Network with the transformed/inner latent space is used  instead of using input  latent code. This mapping part consists of 8 MLP blocks(8 gave the best performance)  which gives __new__ `W-space`  latent code  that is passed to the __Generator__ as a style which consists of 18 conv layers(two for each resolution 4 ** 2 - 1024 ** 2).  See [#Architecture] figure.    Through the experimental process it was found out that starting image at the top of `g-Generator` can be learn   constant tensor instead of a real image. Following the architecture this image then in each block   follows the next process. First conv layer. Then summed with _per channel scaled  noise_ (scaling is learned as B-parameter). Then again conv. Then AdaIN block.    AdaIN Block can be described the next way:  ![AdaIN](assets/adain.png)  where `x_i` is input per channel feature passed vertically from top and `(y_s_i  y_b_i)` are _style_ parameters  got from transformation of `w-vector` from input `W` latent space. To get these style parameters this vector is   first passed through learned affine transformation.       **To sum it all up**  the main interesting points are: the input `4x4x512` tensor is always the same and we   only get styles from our latent variable. Moreover they say that at each scale changing our _style_ inputs   we can change different **very** localised parts of generated image (See video).      > Copying the styles corresponding to coarse spatial resolutions (4 ** 2–8 ** 2) brings high-level aspects such as pose  general hair style  face shape  and eyeglasses from source B  while all colors(eyes  hair  lighting) and finer facial features resemble A. If we instead copy the styles of middle resolutions (16 ** 2–32 ** 2) from B  we inheritsmaller scale facial features  hair style  eyes open/closed from B  while the pose  general face shape  and eyeglasses from A are preserved.Finally  copying the fine styles (64 ** 2–1024 ** 2)   By the way most of the architecture/training process is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf (Baseline configuration is the Progressive GAN).  The changes made to architecture: - The baseline using bilinear up/downsampling operations  longer training  and tuned hyperparameters - Adding the mapping network and AdaIN operations - Simplify the architecture by removing the traditional input layer and starting the image synthesis from a learned 4 × 4 × 512 constant tensor - Adding the noise inputs - Adding the mixing regularization(I didn't mention it. The idea is the following: in the learning process we don't  take one latent variable  but take two. Then for one part of the network we feed as style first variable and then the other. That way the model separate the influence and doesn't entangle it. At test time see [Mixing] figure below)  ![Architecture](assets/photo5197353128075307948.jpg)  Figure _Architecture_ * **W** - an intermediate latent space * **AdaIN** - adaptive *style* instance normalization * **A** - learned affine transform * **B** - learned per-channel scaling fac-tors to the noise input  ![Mixture](assets/mixture.png)  _Figure Mixing_. Two sets of images were generated from their respective latent codes (sources A and B); the rest of the images were generated bycopying a specified subset of styles from source B and taking the rest from source A.   * **Proposed metrics:**        - Perceptual path length:     ![Path_length](assets/path_length.png)     where `z1  z2` are latent variables; `t` is random value in `(0 1)` interval;     `eps` = `1e-4`; `G` stands for generator; `slerp` - spherical      interpolation; `d(x1  x2)` - `l2(vgg(x1)  vgg(x2))`;     The idea is that for less entangled and informative latent code interpolation of latent-space      vectors should not yield surprisingly non-linear changes in the image. Quantative results in the Table 3.     - Linear separability. Tries to find out the separability in the input     latent code. Given the features of generated images as Male/Female  find out     how informative for this info is input latent code.     The idea is the next: given good dataset as CELEBA-HQ train good classifier of      a given feature; then generate images using our **Generator** and label using trained     classifier so we have <latent variable  class of interest> mapping; then train SVM on this     data and exponent of cross entropy of this model will be the score of Linear Separability.

Most existing methods **recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations** produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead  our proposed network **maintains high-resolution representations** through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage  gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages  and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks **in parallel**. We conduct **repeated multi-scale fusions** such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over  leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result  the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise.

"""**TL; DR.** Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector. It mitigates the high complexity and slow convergence issues of DETR via a novel sampling-based efficient attention mechanism.    ![deformable_detr](./figs/illustration.png)  ![deformable_detr](./figs/convergence.png)  **Abstract.** DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However  it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution  due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues  we proposed Deformable DETR  whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10× less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/Cedric-Perauer/Deformable_Detr_PIL

"""Salmon life cycles follow a predictable pattern: hatch in freshwater  migrate to the ocean for the majority of their lives  and then migrate back to their original freshwater hatch sites before they spawn and then die. The time spent in freshwater and ocean salt water depends on the species.  Salmon populations in the waters of Puget Sound are estimated each year when a mature portion of the salmon migrate back from the ocean to freshwater to spawn. In many areas  this pathway is partially obstructed by boat locks (Seattle)  or hydroelectric dams (Bonneville) and the salmon travel through carefully built fish ladders on this upstream journey. As they pass through the ladders  viewing windows allow them to be seen by both tourists and biologists  and human viewers are still the primary way to count the fish.  |Fish ladder| Bonneville Dam public window| Bonneville counting window (non-public)| |---|---|---| |<img src=""./assets/fish_ladder.png"" alt=""fish ladder explanation at https: //www youtube com/watch?v=sabk7Khq0kQ"" width='300' />| <img src=""./assets/fish_143.jpg"" alt=""man viewing fish through underwater viewing window"" width=""200""/>|<img src=""http://www.oceanlight.com/stock-photo/bonneville-dam-salmon-count-photo-19368-548507.jpg"" alt=""fisheries biologist counting salmon""  height=""200"" />| |Watch at https: //www youtube com/watch?v=sabk7Khq0kQ||Photo: (c) Phillip Colla OceanLight.com|  Once tallied  the estimated population for each species determines sport fishing limits such as the number of fish per day and the length of the fishing season. This data is also used to make decisions in the operation of salmon fisheries  commercial fishing  restaurants  and tourism.  |Columbia River Chinook Season|Ballard Locks 2020 Sockeye Counts| |---|---| |<img src=""./assets/chinook_2020_Columbia.png"" height='200'/>|<img src=""./assets/ballard_locks_sockeye_counts_71220.jpg"" height='200'/>| |News source: https://wdfw.wa.gov/news/summer-chinook-salmon-fishing-open-july-much-columbia-river | Updated count: https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/reports/counts/lake-washington#sockeye|   The salmon counting task is easier when few are in the ladder; the task is more difficult when many are returning at once. Some locations estimate the full population by counting for a set period of time each day and comparing to historical data. In other locations  24/7 video recording enables biologists to review footage and tally the counts later; weekend tallies can take staff multiple days to catch up on counts. At some sites  interested individuals can sign up for daily notifications on the latest counts.    In the Pacific Northwest  salmon are vital to commerce and to the marine ecosystem  and fish population estimates are key factors in many policy decisions. Current methods require trained biologists to observe the fish passing a viewing window and manually record the fish count on a daily basis.  This project explored the possibility of using machine learning methods of object detection and classification to support these efforts  potentially enabling the collection of data in more locations and over longer time periods.  Custom trained models (e.g. YOLO v5) using images from fish ladders showed that accurate fish detection is promising but non-trivial  counting fish in a still image does not solve the problem of counting fish in video  and that classifying fish by species requires excellent viewing conditions.

"""We trained the model on the dataset with NSFW images as positive and SFW(suitable for work) images as negative. These images were editorially labelled. We cannot release the dataset or other details due to the nature of the data.   We use [CaffeOnSpark](https://github.com/yahoo/CaffeOnSpark) which is a wonderful framework for distributed learning that brings deep learning to Hadoop and Spark clusters for training models for our experiments. Big thanks to the CaffeOnSpark team!  The deep model was first pretrained on ImageNet 1000 class dataset. Then we finetuned the weights on the NSFW dataset. We used the thin resnet 50 1by2 architecture as the pretrained network. The model was generated using [pynetbuilder](https://github.com/jay-mahadeokar/pynetbuilder) tool and replicates the [residual network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf) paper's 50 layer network (with half number of filters in each layer).  You can find more details on how the model was generated and trained [here](https://github.com/jay-mahadeokar/pynetbuilder/tree/master/models/imagenet)  Please note that deeper networks  or networks with more filters can improve accuracy. We train the model using a thin residual network architecture  since it provides good tradeoff in terms of accuracy  and the model is light-weight in terms of runtime (or flops) and memory (or number of parameters).

"""Sonnet has been designed and built by researchers at DeepMind. It can be used to construct neural networks for many different purposes (un/supervised learning  reinforcement learning  ...). We find it is a successful abstraction for our organization  you might too!  More specifically  Sonnet provides a simple but powerful programming model centered around a single concept: `snt.Module`. Modules can hold references to parameters  other modules and methods that apply some function on the user input. Sonnet ships with many predefined modules (e.g. `snt.Linear`  `snt.Conv2D`  `snt.BatchNorm`) and some predefined networks of modules (e.g. `snt.nets.MLP`) but users are also encouraged to build their own modules.  Unlike many frameworks Sonnet is extremely unopinionated about **how** you will use your modules. Modules are designed to be self contained and entirely decoupled from one another. Sonnet does not ship with a training framework and users are encouraged to build their own or adopt those built by others.  Sonnet is also designed to be simple to understand  our code is (hopefully!) clear and focussed. Where we have picked defaults (e.g. defaults for initial parameter values) we try to point out why.

"""To practice what you've learned  a good idea would be to spend an hour on 3 of the following (3-hours total  you could through them all if you want) and then write a blog post about what you've learned.  * For an overview of the different problems within NLP and how to solve them read through:    * [A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32)   * [How to solve 90% of NLP problems: a step-by-step guide](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e) * Go through [MIT's Recurrent Neural Networks lecture](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU). This will be one of the greatest additions to what's happening behind the RNN model's you've been building. * Read through the [word embeddings page on the TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings). Embeddings are such a large part of NLP. We've covered them throughout this notebook but extra practice would be well worth it. A good exercise would be to write out all the code in the guide in a new notebook.  * For more on RNN's in TensorFlow  read and reproduce [the TensorFlow RNN guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn). We've covered many of the concepts in this guide  but it's worth writing the code again for yourself. * Text data doesn't always come in a nice package like the data we've downloaded. So if you're after more on preparing different text sources for being with your TensorFlow deep learning models  it's worth checking out the following:   * [TensorFlow text loading tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/text).   * [Reading text files with Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/) by Real Python. * This notebook has focused on writing NLP code. For a mathematically rich overview of how NLP with Deep Learning happens  read [Standford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning lecture notes Part 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/readings/cs224n-2019-notes01-wordvecs1.pdf).     * For an even deeper dive  you could even do the whole [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) course.  * Great blog posts to read:   * Andrei Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) dives into generating Shakespeare text with RNNs.   * [Text Classification with NLP: Tf-Idf vs Word2Vec vs BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-nlp-tf-idf-vs-word2vec-vs-bert-41ff868d1794) by Mauro Di Pietro. An overview of different techniques for turning text into numbers and then classifying it.   * [What are word embeddings?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) by Machine Learning Mastery. * Other topics worth looking into:   * [Attention mechanisms](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/). These are a foundational component of the transformer architecture and also often add improvments to deep NLP models.   * [Transformer architectures](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). This model architecture has recently taken the NLP world by storm  achieving state of the art on many benchmarks. However  it does take a little more processing to get off the ground  the [HuggingFace Models (formerly HuggingFace Transformers) library](https://huggingface.co/models/) is probably your best quick start.  ---   1. Rebuild  compile and train `model_1`  `model_2` and `model_5` using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) instead of the Functional API. 2. Retrain the baseline model with 10% of the training data. How does perform compared to the Universal Sentence Encoder model with 10% of the training data? 3. Try fine-tuning the TF Hub Universal Sentence Encoder model by setting `training=True` when instantiating it as a Keras layer.  ``` #: We can use this encoding layer in place of our text_vectorizer and embedding layer sentence_encoder_layer = hub.KerasLayer(""https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4""                                          input_shape=[]                                          dtype=tf.string                                          trainable=True) #: turn training on to fine-tune the TensorFlow Hub model ``` 4. Retrain the best model you've got so far on the whole training set (no validation split). Then use this trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and format the predictions into the same format as the `sample_submission.csv` file from Kaggle (see the Files tab in Colab for what the `sample_submission.csv` file looks like). Once you've done this  [make a submission to the Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data)  how did your model perform? 5. Combine the ensemble predictions using the majority vote (mode)  how does this perform compare to averaging the prediction probabilities of each model? 6. Make a confusion matrix with the best performing model's predictions on the validation set and the validation ground truth labels.

We sincerely hope that this paper can bring you inspiration about the Attention Mechanism  especially how **the low-rankness and the optimization-driven method** can help model the so-called *Global Information* in deep learning. We also highlight **Hamburger as a semi-implicit model and one-step gradient as an alternative for training both implicit and semi-implicit models**.  We model the global context issue as a low-rank completion problem and show that its optimization algorithms can help design global information blocks. This paper then proposes a series of Hamburgers  in which we employ the optimization algorithms for solving MDs to factorize the input representations into sub-matrices and reconstruct a low-rank embedding. Hamburgers with different MDs can perform favorably against the popular global context module self-attention when carefully coping with gradients back-propagated through MDs.  ![contents](assets/Hamburger.jpg)  We are working on some exciting topics.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

All models are trained on a processed version of the publicly available LFW face dataset.  Our motivation is to learn about different face generation architectures since there are many applications related to face generation  including police sketching and data augmentation. We are also interested in assessing the effects of GANs on face generation. We would like to determine if GANs create sharper reconstructions and whether a VAE-GAN has more control over generations due to the restrictions on its latent space [1].  Considering the complexity of the task  machine learning is an appropriate tool for it; face generation is a task that does not lend itself to rules-based systems.

The archive contains the files data_batch_1  data_batch_2  ...  data_batch_5  as well as test_batch. For each batch files: 	data -- a 10000x3072 numpy array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 32x32 color image. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values  the next 1024 the green  and the final 1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order  so that the first 32 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image. 	labels -- a list of 10000 numbers in the range 0-9. The number at index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array data. The dataset contains another file  called batches.meta. It too contains a Python dictionary object. It has the following entries: 	label_names -- a 10-element list which gives meaningful names to the numeric labels in the labels array described above.

"""**RNN based seq2seq model**:  A seq2seq model is mainly used in NLP tasks such as machine translation and often based on LSTM or GRU structure. It has encoder  decoder and intermediate step as its main components  mapping an arbitrarily long input sequence to an arbitrarily long output sequence with an intermediate encoded state.:  <p align=""center"">   <img src=""figures/seq2seq.png"">  </p>  In comparison to fully connected feed forward neural networks  recurrent neural networks has no longer the requirement a fixed-sized input and considers naturally the relation between previous and current time steps. In addition  LSTM or GRU are advanced RNN structures  which increase the ability of capturing long-term dependencies  by forcing a approximately constant back-propagation error flow during training.  However  due to the recurrent calculation for each time step  parrellelization is impossible for training theses networks. And it's a big disadvantage in the big data era. Even the input time range for a LSTM can not be arbitrary long in reality  and it is in fact severly limited by the training mechanism of RNN.  **Wavenet based approach**:  With Wavenet  the training procedure for all the time steps in the input can be parrellelized. We just let the output sequence be one time step ahead of the input sequence  and at every time step of the output  the value is only influenced by the previous steps in the input.  As for the inference stage  it yields every time only the prediction one step ahead as in the LSTM approach. But we don't need to define a distinct model for inferencing here. In each Iteration  the last point of the output sequence is selected as the prediction one step ahead of the previous iteration  and it is in turn concatenated to the input sequence  in order to predict one step further in the future.    The model architecture is similar to WaveNet  consisting of a stack of dilated causal convolutions  as demonstrated in the [diagram](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) below. For more details  see van den Oord's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).  <p align=""center"">   <img src=""figures/wavenet.gif"">  </p>  **Causal Convolution**:  The figure below shows a causal structure  which guarantees that the current time step is only influenced by the previous time steps. Then an expression of the conditional probability could be established. That is to say  we assume that the current value is conditioned on the previous values in a time sequence.    <p align=""center"">   <img src=""figures/WaveNet_causalconv.png"">  </p>  **Dilated Convolution**:  But as can be seen  the reception field is quite small with a limited number of stacks  and it results in poor performance handling long-term dependencies. So the idea of dilated convolution is employed. In a dilated convolution layer  filters are not applied to inputs in a simple sequential manner  but instead skip a constant dilation rate inputs in between each of the inputs they process  as in the WaveNet diagram below. By increasing the dilation rate multiplicatively at each layer (e.g. 1  2  4  8  …)  we can achieve the exponential relationship between layer depth and receptive field size that we desire. The figure below ilustrates the effect of dilation.  <p align=""center"">   <img src=""figures/WaveNet_dilatedconv.png"">  </p>   """;Sequential;https://github.com/ZhouYuxuanYX/Wavenet-in-Keras-for-Kaggle-Competition-Web-Traffic-Time-Series-Forecasting

"""We present DEAR  a DL-based approach that supports auto-fixing for the bugs that require changes at once to one or multiple hunks and one or multiple consecutive statements.We first design a novel fault localization (FL) technique for multi-hunk  multi-statement fixes that combines traditional  spectrum-based (SB) FL with deep learning and data-flow analysis. It takes the buggy statements returned by the SBFL  and detects the buggy hunks to be fixed at once and expands a buggy statement s in a hunk to include other suspicious statements from s. We enhance a two-tier  tree-based LSTM model that incorporates cycle training and uses a divide-andconquer strategy to learn proper code transformations for fixing multiple statements in the suitable fixing context consisting of surrounding subtrees. We conducted several experiments to evaluate DEAR on three datasets: Defects4J (395 bugs)  BigFix (+26k bugs)  and CPatMiner (+44k bugs). In CPatMiner  DEAR fixes 71 and 164 more bugs  including 52 and 61 more multi-hunk/multistatement bugs  than existing DL-based APR tools. Among 667 fixed bugs  there are 169 (25.3%) multi-hunk/multi-statement ones.

"""**BERT**  or **B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers  is a new method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  Our academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).  To give a few numbers  here are the results on the [SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) question answering task:  SQuAD v1.1 Leaderboard (Oct 8th 2018) | Test EM  | Test F1 ------------------------------------- | :------: | :------: 1st Place Ensemble - BERT             | **87.4** | **93.2** 2nd Place Ensemble - nlnet            | 86.0     | 91.7 1st Place Single Model - BERT         | **85.1** | **91.8** 2nd Place Single Model - nlnet        | 83.5     | 90.1  And several natural language inference tasks:  System                  | MultiNLI | Question NLI | SWAG ----------------------- | :------: | :----------: | :------: BERT                    | **86.7** | **91.1**     | **86.3** OpenAI GPT (Prev.

"""This demo is a Swift program that uses a pre-trained Inception model (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567).  It can load the prebuilt model into a Perfect TensorFlow Session object  like this:  ``` swift let g = try TF.Graph() let def = try TF.GraphDef(serializedData: model) try g.import(definition: def) ```  Accompanied by this model  a known object name list also would be loaded into memory if success.  ``` swift try fTag.open(.read) let lines = try fTag.readString() tags = lines.utf8.split(separator: 10).map { String(describing: $0) } // the tags should be looks like this if success: // tags = [""dummy""  ""kit fox""  ""English setter""  ""Siberian husky"" ...] ```  Once received a picture from client  it will decode the picture (in jpeg format) and normalize it into a specific form:  ``` swift   public func constructAndExecuteGraphToNormalizeImage(imageBytes: Data) throws -> TF.Tensor {     let H:Int32 = 224     let W:Int32 = 224     let mean:Float = 117     let scale:Float = 1     let input = try g.constant(name: ""input2""  value: imageBytes)     let batch = try g.constant( name: ""make_batch""  value: Int32(0))     let scale_v = try g.constant(name: ""scale""  value: scale)     let mean_v = try g.constant(name: ""mean""  value: mean)     let size = try g.constantArray(name: ""size""  value: [H W])     let jpeg = try g.decodeJpeg(content: input  channels: 3)     let cast = try g.cast(value: jpeg  dtype: TF.DataType.dtFloat)     let images = try g.expandDims(input: cast  dim: batch)     let resizes = try g.resizeBilinear(images: images  size: size)     let subbed = try g.sub(x: resizes  y: mean_v)     let output = try g.div(x: subbed  y: scale_v)     let s = try g.runner().fetch(TF.Operation(output)).run()     guard s.count > 0 else { throw TF.Panic.INVALID }     return s[0]   }//end normalize ```  Then you can run a TensorFlow session from this picture input:  ``` swift let result = try g.runner().feed(""input""  tensor: image).fetch(""output"").run() ```  The result is actually a possibility array which matches the known object name list  i.e.  each object in this name list will have a possibility prediction in the corresponding array slot. So checking the max possibility throughout the array may get the most possible object that the input image could be:  ``` swift public func match(image: Data) throws -> (Int  Int) {     let normalized = try constructAndExecuteGraphToNormalizeImage(imageBytes: image)     let possibilities = try executeInceptionGraph(image: normalized)     guard let m = possibilities.max()  let i = possibilities.index(of: m) else {       throw TF.Panic.INVALID     }//end guard     return (i  Int(m * 100))   } ```  The final step is translating the result object index into the tag name of the object and sending it back to the client:  ``` swift let tag = tags[result.0]       let p = result.1       response.setHeader(.contentType  value: ""text/json"")         .appendBody(string: ""{\""value\"": \""Is it a \(tag)?

"""This is an attempt at the classification task featured in the [Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017). The task consists on predicting from CT lung scans whether a patient will develop cancer or not within a year. This is a particularly challenging problem given the very high dimensionality of data and the very limited number of samples.  The competition saw many creative approaches  such as those reported by the winning entries [here](https://github.com/lfz/DSB2017) (1st place)  [here](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/06/29/2017-data-science-bowl-predicting-lung-cancer-2nd-place-solution-write-up-daniel-hammack-and-julian-de-wit/) (2nd place) and [here](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/05/16/data-science-bowl-2017-predicting-lung-cancer-solution-write-up-team-deep-breath/) (9th place). These approaches have in common that:  1. they are based on deep CNNs; 2. leverage external data  in particular the [LUNA dataset](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/); 3. make extensive use of ensemble of models.  What I'm attempting here is a rather more ""purist"" (for lack of a better word) approach that uses no ensemble models and no external data. The purpose of this is simply to explore the possibility of achieving a decent classification accuracy using a single model and using solely the provided data. The current attempt consists of a combination of two neural networks:  * Gaussian Mixture Convolutional AutoEncoder (GMCAE): A convolutional autoencoder cast as Mixture Density Network ([Bishop  1994](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mixture-density-networks/)). This network is used to learn high-level features of patches of lung scans (3D arrays of CT scans in Hounsfield Units)  using unsupervised learning and maximum likelihood on a mixture of Gaussians. * CNN classifier: Performs binary classification upon the features extracted by the encoding layers of the GMCAE.  ![model_overview](illustrations/model_overview.png ""Model overview"")   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/alegonz/kdsb17

I think a good model needs to have a good [Inductive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias)  which means it has good generalization capability to unseen example during training.  The difference between the Neural Network method of learning and other learning paradigm is that the Neural Network method learns from data by making a good representation of that data. On the contrary  many other methods learn by features that are manually selected by humans.  The Transformer model is one of the most popular representation generators of Neural Network methods of learning. Because of its general representation processing mechanism such as Attention-based learning  many recent advancements of deep learning rely on it.  So what actually Transformers do?

"""Since our Shapes study makes use of multiple data sources and a specific augmentation process  we created a separate script called `prepare_Shapes_data.py` for this preprocessing stage. It can be invoked as follows: ```python -m code.ml.preprocessing.prepare_Shapes_data path/to/folds_file.csv path/to/output_directory/ factor``` Here  `folds_file.csv` is a csv file that contains the columns `path` (giving the relative path of the image file from the project's root directory) and `fold` (the fold to which this image belongs). For classification data  a column `class` indicates the image class  while for data with psychological similarity ratings  the column `id` gives the stimulus ID used in the similarity space. The script will read all images listed in the `path` column of the `folds_file.csv`  create `factor` augmented copies of each image (by scaling it to a random size between 168 and 224 and by randomly translating it afterwards). The resulting augmented images will be stored as individual png files in the given `output_directory` and an additional pickle file containing a (shuffled) list of paths and classes/ids is created in the same file.  The script takes the following optional arguments: - `-p` or `--pickle_output_folder`: If a pickle output similar to the one provided by `data_augmentation.py` is desired  you can define the output folder for the augmented images here. - `-n` or `--noise_prob`: A list of floats specifying the different noise levels of salt and pepper noise to be added in the pickle versions. - `-s` or `--seed`: Specify a seed for the random number generator in order to make the results deterministic. If no seed is given  then the random number generator is not seeded. - `-o` or `--output_size`: Size of the output image  defaults to 224. - `-m` or `--minimum_size`: Minimal size of the object  defaults to 168.

The choice of the representation is crucial for the performance of your system. Among time-frequency decompositions  Spectrograms have been proved to be a useful representation for audio processing. They consist in 2D images representing sequences of Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with time and frequency as axes  and brightness representing the strength of a frequency component at each time frame. In such they appear a natural domain to apply the CNNS architectures for images directly to sound. Between magnitude and phase spectrograms  magnitude spectrograms contain most the structure of the signal. Phase spectrograms appear to show only little temporal and spectral regularities.  In this project  I will use magnitude spectrograms as a representation of sound (cf image below) in order to predict the noise model to be subtracted to a noisy voice spectrogram.  <img src=""img/sound_to_spectrogram.png"" alt=""sound representation"" title=""sound representation"" />  The project is decomposed in three modes: `data creation`  `training` and `prediction`.

"""Spell corrector.ipynb   We tackle the problem of OCR post processing. In OCR  we map the image form of the document into the text domain. This is done first using an CNN+LSTM+CTC model  in our case based on tesseract. Since this output maps only image to text  we need something on top to validate and correct language semantics.  The idea is to build a language model  that takes the OCRed text and corrects it based on language knowledge. The langauge model could be: - Char level: the aim is to capture the word morphology. In which case it's like a spelling correction system. - Word level: the aim is to capture the sentence semnatics. But such systems suffer from the OOV problem. - Fusion: to capture semantics and morphology language rules. The output has to be at char level  to avoid the OOV.

To solve the alarming problem and prevent such unfathomable consequences  traffic violation detection systems are needed. For which the system enforces proper traffic regulations at all times  and apprehend those who does not comply. A traffic violation detection system must be realized in real-time as the authorities track the roads all the time. Hence  traffic enforcers will not only be at ease in implementing safe roads accurately  but also efficiently; as the traffic detection system detects violations faster than humans. This system can detect most common three types of traffic violation in real-time which are signal violation  parking violation and wrong direction violation.

For example  a graph can contain people as nodes and friendships between them as links  with data like a person's age and the date a friendship was established. StellarGraph supports analysis of many kinds of graphs:  - homogeneous (with nodes and links of one type)  - heterogeneous (with more than one type of nodes and/or links) - knowledge graphs (extreme heterogeneous graphs with thousands of types of edges) - graphs with or without data associated with nodes - graphs with edge weights  StellarGraph is built on [TensorFlow 2](https://tensorflow.org/) and its [Keras high-level API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)  as well as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org).

"""<img src=""./fig/fig.png"" width=""1000"">  X3D is an efficient video architecture  searched/optimized for learning video representations. Here  the author expands a tiny base network along axes: space and time (of the input)  width and depth (of the network)  optimizing for the performace at a given complexity (params/FLOPs). It further relies on depthwise-separable 3D convolutions [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)  inverted-bottlenecks in residual blocks [[2]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Sandler_MobileNetV2_Inverted_Residuals_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)  squeeze-and-excitation blocks [[3]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Hu_Squeeze-and-Excitation_Networks_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)  swish (soft) activations [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941;%20http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941.pdf) and sparse clip sampling (at inference) to improve its efficiency.  Multigrid training is a mechanism to train video architectures efficiently. Instead of using a fixed batch size for training  this method proposes to use varying batch sizes in a defined schedule  yet keeping the computational budget approximately unchaged by keeping `batch x time x height x width` a constant. Hence  this follows a coarse-to-fine training process by having lower spatio-temporal resolutions at higher batch sizes and vice-versa. In contrast to conventioanl training with a fixed batch size  Multigrid training benefit from 'seeing' more inputs during a training schedule at approximately the same computaional budget.  Our implementaion achieves 62.62% Top-1 accuracy (3-view) on Kinetics-400 when trained for ~200k iterations from scratch (a 4x shorter schedule compared to the original  when adjusted with the linear scaling rule [[5]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf%5B3%5D%20ImageNet))  which takes only ~2.8 days on 4 Titan RTX GPUs. This is much faster than previous Kinetics-400 training schedules on a single machine. Longer schedules can achieve SOTA results. We port and include the weights trained by FAIR for a longer schedule on 128 GPUs  which achieves 71.48% Top-1 accuracy (3-view) on Kinetics-400. This can be used for fine-tuning on other datasets. For instance  we can train on Charades classification (35.01% mAP) and localization (17.71% mAP) within a few hours on 2 Titan RTX GPUs. All models and training logs are included in the repository.   Note: the Kinetics-400 dataset that we trained on contains ~220k (~240k) training and ~17k (~20k) validation clips compared to (original dataset) due to availability.

"""Can we infer intentions and goals from a person's actions? As an example of this family of problems  we consider here whether it is possible to decipher what a person is searching for by decoding their eye movement behavior. We conducted two human psychophysics experiments on object arrays and natural images where we monitored subjects' eye movements while they were looking for a target object. Using as input the pattern of ""error"" fixations on non-target objects before the target was found  we developed a model (InferNet) whose goal was to infer what the target was. ""Error"" fixations share similar features with the sought target. The Infernet model uses a pre-trained 2D convolutional architecture to extract features from the error fixations and computes a 2D similarity map between the error fixation and all locations across the search image by modulating the search image via convolution across layers. InferNet consolidates the modulated response maps across layers via max pooling to keep track of the sub-patterns highly similar to features at error fixations and integrates these maps across all error fixations. InferNet successfully identifies the subject's goal and outperforms all the competitive null models  even without any object-specific training on the inference task.   [![problemintro](img/Capture.JPG)](img/Capture.JPG)  We present an example below. The figure shows the error fixations indicated by yellow number in the visual search process of one human subject (Column 1)  the inference maps predicted by our InferNet based on human error fixations (Column 2) and the inferred target location denoted by green numbers (Column 3) from the inference maps.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""This project turns edge devices such as Raspberry Pi into an intelligent gateway with deep learning running on it. No internet connection is required  everything is done locally on the edge device itself. Further  multiple edge devices can create a distributed AIoT network.  At DT42  we believe that bringing deep learning to edge devices is the trend towards the future. It not only saves costs of data transmission and storage but also makes devices able to respond according to the events shown in the images or videos without connecting to the cloud.  ![Figure 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/292790/45943626-a3d28b80-c019-11e8-829c-5eb6afd3faa4.png)  <p align=""center"">Figure 1: BerryNet architecture</p>  Figure 1 shows the software architecture of the project  we use Node.js/Python  MQTT and an AI engine to analyze images or video frames with deep learning. So far  there are two default types of AI engines  the classification engine (with Inception v3 [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567.pdf) model) and the object detection engine (with TinyYOLO [[2]](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLO9000.pdf) model or MobileNet SSD [[3]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf) model).

For example  Figure 3 shows the analyzed results from the camera hosted in the DT42 office. The frames were captured by the IP camera and they were submitted into the AI engine. The output from the AI engine will be shown in the dashboard.

This implementation uses only default Flax components like `flax.nn.Model` and `flax.nn.Module`  showing that this kind of optimization-based Meta Learning algorithms can easily be implemented in Flax/JAX.

We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage  gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages  and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks **in parallel**. We conduct **repeated multi-scale fusions** such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over  leading to rich high-resolution representations.

"""An important field within computer vision is medical imaging. However  a main problem within this area of research is that it is difficult to obtain a large sample of training images. Limitations to obtaining brain MRIs include: the low availability of participants  the time it takes to obtain and process high resolution MRI brain images  as well as the fact that participants have to stay still for long periods of time (whichkes it difficult to obtain a good image). Therefore it is useful to implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can be trained on existing brain MRIs and then if trained successfully  it can generate an infinite number of plausible brain MRIs. This would aid the training of computer vision techniques such as brain segmentation which would require much more expansive datasets that may otherwise not exist without many man-hours of medical imaging.   In particular  I have implemented a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with reference DCGAN specifications in the paper written by Radford  Metz and Chintala [1]. In the DCGAN  the use of convolutional layers allows higher quality feature mapping and recognition relative to the traditional GAN which is only connected by dense layers. In my GAN implementation  I followed specifications such as: * using LeakyReLU in the discriminator * using strided convolutions in the discriminator and fractional-strided convolutions in the generator * using batchnorm in both the generator and discriminator * remove fully connected hidden layers * scaling training image pixel values from -1 to 1 * in LeakyReLU  the slope of the leak was set to 0.2 * using an Adam optimiser with learning rate of 0.0002 for both generator and discriminator (I used 0.0002 for the generator and 0.0001 for the discriminator) * no pooling layers  I also did not follow several specifications as I found they either did not work or produced lower quality results: * They suggested the use of a ReLU activation function in the generator  however  I found LeakyReLU worked better as they are more effective in preventing vanishing gradients. They also suggested the use of a Tanh activation function in the final layer of the generator  however  I found my model worked better without any activation functions in the generator and discriminator. * Instead of using a batch size of 128  I used a batch size of 10 (i.e. 10 real and 10 fake images in each batch). I found larger batch sizes would overload the GPU. * The paper suggested the use of beta_1=0.5 for the Adam optimiser  however I found that using the default beta_1=0.9 worked fine. * I decided to use a latent space of 256 instead of 100 for no real reason and this worked quite well * For the Conv2DTranspose layers  when using the depicted kernel size of (5 5) with stride (2 2) (Figure 1 in [1]) I got very aliased generator images with grid artifacts. This was remedied by using a kernel size of (4 4) with stride (2 2) * Also in reference to Figure 1 in [1]  I tried using four fractionally-strided convolutions (Conv2DTranspose) layers with one convolutional layer after and ended up with mode collapse. My model was working and produced very high quality brain images (SSIM>0.6) however  my generator would only produce the same images regardless of the noise input. I later fixed this by using three Conv2DTranspose layers and two convolutional layers instead. * I used dropout layers in my discriminator to make my discriminator learn more slowly. I did not try running the GAN without dropout layers so I'm not sure if this had any real effect  but the current model is quite effective. * In contrast to the number of filters in the generator in Figure 1 in [1] (which had filters 1024  512  256  128 for the Conv2DTranspose layers)  I used a maximum of 256 for the filters in my layers. I originally implemented the same number of filters in my generator as the paper  however  I found that my GPU would run out of memory due to the large number of filters. Also the brain MRI images are quite simple so may not require the larger number of filters.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/amyzhao11/GANBrain

"""Pixel CNNs are a type of autoregressive generative models which try to model the generation of images as a sequence of generation of pixels. They use multiple convolutional layers to model the generation of next pixel conditioned on the pixels of the image which have already been generated. The layers preserve the spatial resolution of the input image in order to output the image of same size. During training phase  we start from the input image as shown below and perform convolution over it with the kernel of our first layer.   ![Representation of Convolution on the input without masking](images/Unmasked_Conv.png)  In the example above  we try to generate the pixel in the centre using the pixels which have already been generated. As described in the paper we are generating the pixels in the sequence as shown below:  ![Generating image as a sequence of Pixels](images/Sequence.png)  Clearly  pixel `a` should therefore not take into account the `b  f and g` since as per the sequence  during testing time  it won't have access to them. In order to replicate this even during the training stage as well  [A Oord et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) propose modification to the convolutional kernel by applying a mask to it. The mask will make that portion  which is not accessible to the model during testing time while generating the central pixel  0 as can be seen below:  ![Representation of Convolution on the input without masking](images/Masked_Conv.png)  Thus sequence by sequence we keep on generating the pixels one by one until the entire image is generated.

"""The increasing number of cars in cities can cause high volume of traffic  and implies that traffic violations become more critical nowadays in Bangladesh and also around the world. This causes severe destruction of property and more accidents that may endanger the lives of the people. To solve the alarming problem and prevent such unfathomable consequences  traffic violation detection systems are needed. For which the system enforces proper traffic regulations at all times  and apprehend those who does not comply. A traffic violation detection system must be realized in real-time as the authorities track the roads all the time. Hence  traffic enforcers will not only be at ease in implementing safe roads accurately  but also efficiently; as the traffic detection system detects violations faster than humans. This system can detect most common three types of traffic violation in real-time which are signal violation  parking violation and wrong direction violation. A user friendly graphical interface is associated with the system to make it simple for the user to operate the system  monitor traffic and take action against the violations of traffic rules.

"""**Deep Vision Transformer** is initially described in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11886)  which observes the attention collapese phenomenon when training deep vision transformers: In this paper  we show that  unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers  the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically  we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper  the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words  the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs  the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation  we propose a simple yet effective method  named Re-attention  to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably  when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks  the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6% on ImageNet.  <p align=""center""> <img src=""https://github.com/zhoudaquan/DeepViT_ICCV21/blob/master/figures/performance_comparison.png"" | width=500> </p>   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/zhoudaquan/dvit_repo

In particular  I focused on implementing and optimizing SchNet: a novel GCN that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on quantum chemical property benchmarks. As a byproduct  I hoped to learn more about GCNs and how they could be used for chemical applications.

The main features of this models are 1) the enhancement of diversification and 2) the restriction of diversification. As for the former one  while the base model ([SingleGAN](https://github.com/Xiaoming-Yu/SingleGAN)) employed KL divergence loss to restrict the distribution of encoded features like [VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)  SRGAN exploits 3 new losses instead: batch KL divergence loss  correlation loss  and histogram imitation loss.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""You have an audio recording  and you want to know where certain classes of sounds are.  SongExplorer is trained to recognize such words by manually giving it a few examples.  It will then automatically calculate the probability  over time  of when those words occur in all of your recordings.  Applications suitable for SongExplorer include quantifying the rate or pattern of words emitted by a particular species  distinguishing a recording of one species from another  and discerning whether individuals of the same species produce different song.  Underneath the hood is a deep convolutional neural network.  The input is the raw audio stream  and the output is a set of mutually-exclusive probability waveforms corresponding to each word of interest.  Training begins by first thresholding one of your recordings in the time- and frequency-domains to find sounds that exceed the ambient noise. These sounds are then clustered into similar categories for you to manually annotate with however many word labels naturally occur.  A classifier is then trained on this corpus of ground truth  and a new recording is analyzed by it.  The words it automatically finds are then clustered as before  but this time are displayed with predicted labels.  You manually correct the mistakes  both re-labeling words that it got wrong  as well as labeling words it missed.  These new annotations are added to the ground truth  and the process of retraining the classifier and analyzing and correcting new recordings is repeated until the desired accuracy is reached.

Our academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).  To give a few numbers  here are the results on the [SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) question answering task:  SQuAD v1.1 Leaderboard (Oct 8th 2018) | Test EM  | Test F1 ------------------------------------- | :------: | :------: 1st Place Ensemble - BERT             | **87.4** | **93.2** 2nd Place Ensemble - nlnet            | 86.0     | 91.7 1st Place Single Model - BERT         | **85.1** | **91.8** 2nd Place Single Model - nlnet        | 83.5     | 90.1  And several natural language inference tasks:  System                  | MultiNLI | Question NLI | SWAG ----------------------- | :------: | :----------: | :------: BERT                    | **86.7** | **91.1**     | **86.3** OpenAI GPT (Prev.

"""This notebook focuses on the so-called Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) introduced by  Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)].  The ULMFiT model consists of three main stages in the building a language model (LM):  1. **General-domain LM  pre-training**: Similar to the ImageNet database used in computer vision   the idea is to pre-train a large corpus of text. The ULMFiT has a pre-trained model called the  `Wikitext-103` where more than 20 000 Wikipedia articles was trained on.  This is alreadly included in the `fastai.text` API  thus  it is not necessary to carry out this step.  2. **LM fine-tuning**: Because the target data (typically) comes from a different  distribution from the general-domain  it is necessary to fine-tune the LM to adapt to  the idosyncrasies of the target data. Howard and Ruder suggested *discriminative fine-tuning* and *slanted triangular learning rates* for fine-tuning the LM. These techniques are available  in `fastai` and are described in [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)].  3. **Classifier fine-tuning**: Using the updated weights from the previous step  a classifier can be fine-tuned. Howard and Ruder suggested a few techniques which include *concat pooling*  and *gradual unfreezing*. The latter in particular is used in this demonstration.  Again  the `fastai` framework allows one to perform this technique.  **Reference**  [1] J. Howard and S. Ruder. 2018.*Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification*.

"""This is a classifier to predict label of hand drawn doodle images in real time. The idea is based on [QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#) by Google. The [dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) they provide contains 50 million images across 345 categories! I am using a subset of 50 categories for my model because of limited resources but one can use the same code with small tweaks to train on all 345 categories.  I built and trained the model in Pytorch and converted it to onnx format to use it in the browser. Initially my plan was to perform the classification on the backend. After drawing  the user would press a button and the request would be sent to the server for classification. That is how I built the app. However  it was very expensive on the server because for every image there would a request. Hence I decided to move the classification on the frontend. Also it is a lot more fun to see the model try to classify the image in real time :grin:.  It took me a very long time to train and tweak the model to obtain a good accuracy particularly because the dataset was huge even though I was using only a subset of it and training the model on the GPU. How someone draws a certain object varies a lot. It is all based on imagination and perception of that person about that object. Hence it was necessary to use lots of images per category to capture maximum variations.   For the record  88% was the average test accuracy(averaged out across the classes). Had it been allowed to train for longer  I believe it could have crossed 90% mark but I had already spent days on training it so I let it go. Yes days! Colab has a limit on the usage of GPUs after which the runtime gets disconnected. So I had to train the model for some hours every day for about 2-3 days to get good accuracy. Then I would make tweaks to the model and restart the process.     """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/Prateek93a/DoodleAI

Four models are compared: An autoencoder (AE)  a variational autoencoder (VAE)  a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN)  and a Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN). All models are trained on a processed version of the publicly available LFW face dataset.  Our motivation is to learn about different face generation architectures since there are many applications related to face generation  including police sketching and data augmentation. We are also interested in assessing the effects of GANs on face generation. We would like to determine if GANs create sharper reconstructions and whether a VAE-GAN has more control over generations due to the restrictions on its latent space [1].  Considering the complexity of the task  machine learning is an appropriate tool for it; face generation is a task that does not lend itself to rules-based systems.

"""GeDi is a method of using class-conditional language models (which we refer to as generative discriminators (GeDis)) to guide generation from other (potentially much larger) language models. This has several advantages over finetuning large language models directly including:  * significantly less training computation. * maintaining the diversity of the original language model (If we finetune a large pretrained language model to a specific attribute dataset  we will likely reduce the broad generation capabilities of the model). * teaching the language model what not to generate. This is especially useful for applications like detoxification.   GeDi is a form of discriminator guided generation. A discriminator that can classify an attribute could be used to guide language model generation towards that attribute by classifying the sequences that result from candidate next tokens. However  using a normal discriminator (such as [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) to do this would be very computationally expensive during generation  since it would require feeding in every candidate next token one-by-one to the discriminator to be classified. However  using generative discriminators  we can very efficiently classify candidate next tokens during generation using Bayes rule (see Section 3.1 of the paper). As an added bonus  [generative discriminators can be used as zero shot classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01898)  and can therefore be used to guide generation towards unseen topics.

"""* What   * GANs are based on adversarial training.   * Adversarial training is a basic technique to train generative models (so here primarily models that create new images).   * In an adversarial training one model (G  Generator) generates things (e.g. images). Another model (D  discriminator) sees real things (e.g. real images) as well as fake things (e.g. images from G) and has to learn how to differentiate the two.   * Neural Networks are models that can be trained in an adversarial way (and are the only models discussed here).  * How   * G is a simple neural net (e.g. just one fully connected hidden layer). It takes a vector as input (e.g. 100 dimensions) and produces an image as output.   * D is a simple neural net (e.g. just one fully connected hidden layer). It takes an image as input and produces a quality rating as output (0-1  so sigmoid).   * You need a training set of things to be generated  e.g. images of human faces.   * Let the batch size be B.   * G is trained the following way:     * Create B vectors of 100 random values each  e.g. sampled uniformly from [-1  +1]. (Number of values per components depends on the chosen input size of G.)     * Feed forward the vectors through G to create new images.     * Feed forward the images through D to create ratings.     * Use a cross entropy loss on these ratings. All of these (fake) images should be viewed as label=0 by D. If D gives them label=1  the error will be low (G did a good job).     * Perform a backward pass of the errors through D (without training D). That generates gradients/errors per image and pixel.     * Perform a backward pass of these errors through G to train G.   * D is trained the following way:     * Create B/2 images using G (again  B/2 random vectors  feed forward through G).     * Chose B/2 images from the training set. Real images get label=1.     * Merge the fake and real images to one batch. Fake images get label=0.     * Feed forward the batch through D.     * Measure the error using cross entropy.     * Perform a backward pass with the error through D.   * Train G for one batch  then D for one (or more) batches. Sometimes D can be too slow to catch up with D  then you need more iterations of D per batch of G.  * Results   * Good looking images MNIST-numbers and human faces.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""You have an audio recording  and you want to know where certain classes of sounds are.  SongExplorer is trained to recognize such words by manually giving it a few examples.  It will then automatically calculate the probability  over time  of when those words occur in all of your recordings.  Applications suitable for SongExplorer include quantifying the rate or pattern of words emitted by a particular species  distinguishing a recording of one species from another  and discerning whether individuals of the same species produce different song.  Underneath the hood is a deep convolutional neural network.  The input is the raw audio stream  and the output is a set of mutually-exclusive probability waveforms corresponding to each word of interest.  Training begins by first thresholding one of your recordings in the time- and frequency-domains to find sounds that exceed the ambient noise. These sounds are then clustered into similar categories for you to manually annotate with however many word labels naturally occur.  A classifier is then trained on this corpus of ground truth  and a new recording is analyzed by it.  The words it automatically finds are then clustered as before  but this time are displayed with predicted labels.  You manually correct the mistakes  both re-labeling words that it got wrong  as well as labeling words it missed.  These new annotations are added to the ground truth  and the process of retraining the classifier and analyzing and correcting new recordings is repeated until the desired accuracy is reached.

The key idea of SWA is to average multiple samples produced by SGD with a modified learning rate schedule. We use a constant or cyclical learning rate schedule that causes SGD to _explore_ the set of points in the weight space corresponding to high-performing networks.

"""Animation movie studios like Pixar uses a technique called Pathtracing which produces high-quality photorealistic images. Due to the computational complexity of this approach  it will take 8-16 hours to render depending on the composition of the scene. This time-consuming process makes Pathtracing unsuitable for interactive image synthesis. To achieve this increased visual quality in a real time application many approaches have been proposed in the recent past to approximate global illumination effects like ambient occlusion  reflections  indirect light  scattering  depth of field  motion blur and caustics. While these techniques improve the visual quality  the results are incomparable to the one produce by Pathtracing. We propose a novel technique where we make use of a deep generative model to generate high-quality photorealistic frames from a geometry buffer(G-buffer). The main idea here is to train a deep convolutional neural network to find a mapping from G-buffer to pathtraced image of the same scene. This trained network can then be used in a real time scene to get high-quality results.    """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/DeepIllumination

"""With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI)  multimodal emotion recognition has become a major research topic  primarily due to its potential applications in many challenging tasks  such as dialogue generation  user behavior understanding  multimodal interaction  and others. A conversational emotion recognition system can be used to generate appropriate responses by analyzing user emotions (Zhou et al.  2017; Rashkin et al.  2018). In Dialogue Conversations  the utterance by a speaker y (say) depends on the utterance/statement given previously by a speaker x. That there occurs a correlation between the sequence of utterances. This is depicted in Figure-1  where 2 speakers are conversing and there is an emotional shift visible as the conversation proceeds. <br>  ![Figure 1: MELD_about_data](MELD.PNG) <br> **Figure 1: MELD_about_data** <br>   Conversation in its natural form is multimodal. In dialogues  we rely on others’ facial expressions  vocal tonality  language  and gestures to anticipate their stance. For emotion recognition  multimodality is particularly important. For the utterances with language that is difficult to understand  we often resort to other modalities  such as prosodic and visual cues  to identify their emotions. Figure-2 presents examples from the dataset where the presence of multimodal signals in addition to the text itself is necessary in order to make correct predictions of their emotions and sentiments. Multimodal emotion recognition of sequential turns encounters several other challenges. One such example is the classification of short utterances. Utterances like “yeah”  “okay”  “no” can express varied emotions depending on the context and discourse of the dialogue. However  due to the difficulty of perceiving emotions from text alone  most models resort to assigning the majority class. <br> ![Figure 2: Importance of Multimodal Cues](MELD_fig2.png) <br> **Figure 2: Importance of Multimodal Cues** <br> We use MELD [Multimodal Multi-party Dataset for Emotion Recognitions in Conversations Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02508.pdf).

The project is using modified algorithm Deterministic Policy Gradient  (Lillicrap et al.[arXiv:1509.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf))  (written in Tensorflow) to control mobile robot. The main idea was to learn mobile robot navigate  to goal and also avoid obstacles. For obstacles avoidance  robot is using 5 ultrasonic sensors.   For navigation task  required information (like absolute pose) are taken from simulation   engine. That's a little hack.

"""The goal of this tasks consists of generating a text about a specific topic or situation. We used two models in this experiment: GPT-2 and a Transformer model.  On the one hand  despite GPT-2 was only trained to predict the next token in a sentence  it surprisingly learned basic competence in some tasks like translating between languages and answering questions. On the other hand  we implemented a basic Transformer encoder-decoder architecture to analyse whether it is able to generate a similar text to the training data.   In Question-Answering tasks  the model receives a text and a question regarding to the text  and it should mark the beginning and end of the answer in the text.  In this case  it is necessary to fine-tune BERT. We will use XQuAD (Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset) to fine-tune it  which consists of a subset of 240 paragraphs and 1190 question-answer pairs from the development set of SQuAD v1.1 together with their professional translations into 10 languages. Source: https://github.com/deepmind/xquad   BERT's authors trained it in two tasks and one of them is **Masked Language Model** (MLM). The task consists of mask some input tokens randomly  and then try to predict those random tokens. Hence  we do not need to pretrain BERT and we can directly test it.  In this repository  I have implemented **a basic script to infer the masked token** in a sentence.

In this work  we are interested in the human pose estimation problem with a focus on learning reliable high-resolution representations. Most existing methods **recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations** produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead  our proposed network **maintains high-resolution representations** through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage  gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages  and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks **in parallel**. We conduct **repeated multi-scale fusions** such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over  leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result  the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. </br>  ![Illustrating the architecture of the proposed HRNet](/figures/hrnet.png)  """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/d-shivam/Pose-estimation-based-action-recognition-for-help-Situation-Identification

"""Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist in the latent space of GANs. In this paper  we develop an automatic procedure for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation  and we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human supervision. Our method is generator-agnostic  producing strong segmentation results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore  by leveraging GANs pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet  we are able to segment images from a range of domains without further training or finetuning. Evaluating our method on image segmentation benchmarks  we compare favorably to prior work while using neither human supervision nor access to the training data. Broadly  our results demonstrate that automatically extracting foreground-background structure from pretrained deep generative models can serve as a remarkably effective substitute for human supervision.

"""In seismic exploration  the features of wave propagation in elastic media are studied. Processing of seismic data  allows you to determine the structure and elastic properties of the studied medium.  To obtain seismic data  a source of excitation of elastic waves and a recording system are required. In small-scale ground research  a sledgehammer is usually used as a source  and geophones as receivers.  A geophone is a device that consists of an electric coil and a permanent magnet. During the propagation of elastic waves  the magnet inside the geophone oscillates  thereby creating an alternating current in the coil. The signal is recorded for some time. The waveform is usually similar to the velocity or acceleration of the  oscillation of the particles of the medium (depending on the design of the geophone).  The figure below schematically shows the process of obtaining data. Geophones are placed on the profile with some distance from the metal plate (offset). An engineer hits a metal plate with a sledgehammer  creating an elastic wave that  propagates in the medium under study. At this time  geophones record the amplitude of the signal for some time.  Records of each geophone are called a seismic trace (1D data).  ![](examples/seismic_survey.svg)  Since the data on adjacent seismic traces have similarities in the features of the wave field  it is convenient to consider the data together. Therefore  the traces are combined into a seismogram (2D data). The trace number is  indicated on the horizontal axis  and the time of registration (in the number of samples) is indicated on  the vertical axis.  When visualizing traces in a seismogram  positive or negative amplitudes are usually indicated in black. Also   the amplitudes of each trace are normalized to the maximum amplitude of the seismogram  or each trace is normalized  individually. Waves with large amplitudes are usually clip at the threshold.  When only the amplitude  and not the waveform  is important  a seismogram can be displayed using color.  Usually a color seismogram is drawn in grayscale.  The figure below shows the equal seismograms in wiggle and color mode.  ![](examples/color.png)  Note that despite the square shape of the picture  it is not square. Usually  the number of samples in a trace is several thousand  and the number of trace is 24 or more. Therefore  when displayed in color  interpolation is used.

It also achieves good performance on the large-scale [PCQM4M-LSC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09430) (`0.1263 MAE` on val) dataset.

"""Chess has been studied as a subject of artificial intelligence for many decades  which is why it has been described as  “the most widely-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence” (Silver et al. 1). Ranging back all the way to the 1950s  various aspects of the game have been studied; one of the most notable instances of this is IBM's Deep Blue computer. In 1997  Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov (""Deep Blue"")  proving AI's ability to compete against (and beat) the best human chess players.  Given that IBM was able to achieve this over 20 years ago and technology has only continued to evolve  our team chose to focus on creating something that has the ability to derive conclusions from prior player performance and the opening moves used in a chess match. Chess always begins with the same initial board layout; as a result  different combinations of opening moves occur frequently in play and have the potential to be used to predict the outcome of the match at a very early stage. Point systems in chess are often used as the game progresses as a measure of which player holds an advantage; however  our work studies the earliest moves in the game (before players generally begin trading pieces).  Our goal is to predict the likelihood that the result of a chess game can be predicted using only the knowledge of the first x moves and the ratings of the two players involved in the match. Initially  we believed that this may be beneficial for helping players to choose certain openings; though our work may be useful in this respect  the choice of moves should be viewed as a causality of the player's experience. As a result  an inexperienced player making the moves in a bid to play better may yield moderate performance gains  but ultimately the opening moves lead to victory not because they are superior  but because the player making them is superior and recognizes the advantages of using certain openings.

"""**T-TA**  or **T**ransformer-based **T**ext **A**utoencoder   is a new deep bidirectional language model for unsupervised learning tasks. T-TA learns the straightforward learning objective  *language autoencoding*  which is to predict all tokens in a sentence at once using only their context. Unlike ""masked language model""  T-TA has *self-masking* mechanism in order to avoid merely copying the input to output. Unlike BERT (which is for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model)  T-TA is especially beneficial to obtain contextual embeddings   which are fixed representations of each input token generated from the hidden layers of the trained language model.

"""In Neural Network Language Models(NNLM) with huge number of words in vocabulary  exhaustive activation functions such as Softmax are very slow.  This paper addresses shortcomings of Softmax. It consists of mainly two ideas 1. Representing words as low-dimensional feature vectors - to learn relation between words and contexts. 2. Clustering similar words in similar components(subtree) using the feature vectors.  Following is the summary of the Hierarchical Log-Bilinear Model. (If this explanation doesn't summarise the content please go to Section 4 in the Paper) * Initially start with a random binary tree. With words as leaf. * Use log-bilinear model to fit training data.    * Input will be context: w<sub>1</sub> w<sub>2</sub> ... w<sub>n-1</sub>.      * Each word w is represented by a feature vector r<sub>w<sub>1</sub></sub>. Say shape (1 100) each.     * So input at each forward pass will be (n-1  1  100)   * Hidden Layers apply matrix transformations  with weights C <p align='center'> <img src='https://github.com/AshwinDeshpande96/Hierarchical-Softmax/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-06-05%20at%208.38.05%20PM.png' width=150> </p>      * Output will be w<sub>n</sub>     * Will be a predicted feature vector r_hat     * So output shape at each forward pass will be (1 100)       * If there are 8 words in vocabulary (output classes)(Fig-1)         * Each of q<sub>i</sub> are multiplied with output r_hat and activated using sigmoid. Gives the probability of decision going to left subtree.          <p align='center'> P(d<sub>i</sub> = 1): sigmoid( r_hat * q<sub>i</sub> + b<sub>i</sub>) </p>                  * Each leaf is scored according to it's decision code. For example:            * leaf_5: P(d<sub>1</sub>=0  d<sub>3</sub>=1  d<sub>6</sub>=1)           * leaf_3: P(d<sub>1</sub>=1  d<sub>2</sub>=0  d<sub>5</sub>=1) * Fit the model with given data   * This is a teacher-forcing type of model  output at time step t is used at the next step t+1.   * This creates feature vectors r_hat depending on the context as we train. <p align='center'> <img src='https://github.com/AshwinDeshpande96/Hierarchical-Softmax/blob/master/tree.png'> </p>  Task specific feature vector perform well in every NLP task  because the tailored feature vector represent the training data well: [Deep contextualized word representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf)     """;Natural Language Processing;https://github.com/AshwinDeshpande96/Hierarchical-Softmax

"""•	UNet++ aims to improve segmentation accuracy  with a series of nested  dense skip pathways.  •	Redesigned skip pathways make optimization easier by getting the semantically similar feature maps.  •	Dense skip connections improve segmentation accuracy and make the gradient flow smoother.  •	Deep supervision allows for model complexity tuning to balance between speed and performance optimization by allowing the model to toggle between 2 different training modes in the fast mode and the accurate mode.  •	UNet++ differs from the original U-Net in three ways - (refer architecture diagram above)    - It has convolution layers (green)on skip pathways  which bridges the semantic gap between encoder and decoder feature maps.        - It has dense skip connections on skip pathways (blue)  which improves gradient flow.        - It employs deep supervision (red)  which enables model pruning and improves or in the worst case achieves comparable performance to using only one loss layer.   UNet++  a convolutional neural network dedicated for biomedical image segmentation  was designed  and applied in 2018 by (Zhou et al.  2018). UNet++ was basically designed to overcome some of the short comings of the UNet architecture. UNet works on the idea of skip connections. U-Net concatenates them and add convolutions and non-linearities between each up-sampling block. The skip connections recover the full spatial resolution at the network output  making fully convolutional methods suitable for semantic segmentation. UNet and other segmentation models based on the encoder-decoder architecture tend to fuse semantically dissimilar feature maps from the encoder and decoder sub-networks  which may degrade segmentation performance. This is where UNet++ is shown to have an edge over the other players as it bridges the semantic gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder prior to fusion thus improving the segmentation performance and output.

"""![Schematic Illustration MAS](https://github.com/SAP-samples/acl2019-commonsense/blob/master/img/mas_illustration.png) The recently introduced [BERT (Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding)](https://github.com/google-research/bert) [1] model exhibits strong performance on several language understanding benchmarks. In this work  we describe a simple re-implementation of BERT for commonsense reasoning. We show that the attentions produced by BERT can be directly utilized for tasks such as the Pronoun Disambiguation Problem (PDP) and Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC). Our proposed attention-guided commonsense reasoning method is conceptually simple yet empirically powerful. Experimental analysis on multiple datasets demonstrates that our proposed system performs remarkably well on all cases while outperforming the previously reported state of the art by a margin. While results suggest that BERT seems to implicitly learn to establish complex relationships between entities  solving commonsense reasoning tasks might require more than unsupervised models learned from huge text corpora. The sample code provided within this repository allows to replicate the results reported in the paper for PDP and WSC.

To do so we first calculate the scores of anchors conditioned on the model and fit a probability distribution to these scores. The model is then trained with anchors separated into positive and negative samples according to their probabilities.

"""1.Description:  A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning system invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Two neural networks compete with each other in a game. Given a training set  this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.  In this competition  you’ll be training generative models to create images of dogs. Only this time… there’s no ground truth data for you to predict. Here  you’ll submit the images and be scored based on how well those images are classified as dogs from pre-trained neural networks. Take these images  for example. Can you tell which are real vs. generated?    2.Evaluation:MiFID  用生成模型所常用的指标[FID](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1647349368499780367&wfr=spider&for=pc) 之前的Mi是Memorization-informed的简称 官方解释如下:The memorization distance is defined as the minimum cosine distance of all training samples in the feature space  averaged across all user generated image samples.

Amazingly  with only 2 hours of GPU time (about $0.50 using an Amazon EC2 spot instance)  it was not difficult to reach 50% top-1 accuracy and almost 80% top-5 accuracy.

"""We propose ResRep  a novel method for lossless channel pruning (a.k.a. filter pruning)  which aims to slim down a convolutional neural network (CNN) by reducing the width (number of output channels) of convolutional layers. Inspired by the neurobiology research about the independence of remembering and forgetting  we propose to re-parameterize a CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts  where the former learn to maintain the performance and the latter learn for efficiency. By training the re-parameterized model using regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the latter  we realize structured sparsity  enabling us to equivalently convert the re-parameterized model into the original architecture with narrower layers. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on parameters to produce structured sparsity  which may suppress the parameters essential for the remembering. Our method slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop  which is the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio  to the best of our knowledge.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""**This project aims at building a speech enhancement system to attenuate environmental noise.**  <img src=""img/denoise_10classes.gif"" alt=""Spectrogram denoising"" title=""Speech enhancement""/>    Audios have many different ways to be represented  going from raw time series to time-frequency decompositions. The choice of the representation is crucial for the performance of your system. Among time-frequency decompositions  Spectrograms have been proved to be a useful representation for audio processing. They consist in 2D images representing sequences of Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with time and frequency as axes  and brightness representing the strength of a frequency component at each time frame. In such they appear a natural domain to apply the CNNS architectures for images directly to sound. Between magnitude and phase spectrograms  magnitude spectrograms contain most the structure of the signal. Phase spectrograms appear to show only little temporal and spectral regularities.  In this project  I will use magnitude spectrograms as a representation of sound (cf image below) in order to predict the noise model to be subtracted to a noisy voice spectrogram.  <img src=""img/sound_to_spectrogram.png"" alt=""sound representation"" title=""sound representation"" />  The project is decomposed in three modes: `data creation`  `training` and `prediction`.

"""Named entity recognition (NER) is a central component in natural language processing tasks. Identifying named entities is a key part in systems e.g. for question answering or entity linking. Traditionally  NER systems are built using conditional random fields (CRFs). Recent systems are using neural network architectures like bidirectional LSTM with a CRF-layer ontop and pre-trained word embeddings ([Ma and Hovy  2016](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1101); [Lample et al.  2016a](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1030); [Reimers and Gurevych  2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1035); [Lin et al.  2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4421)).  Pre-trained word embeddings have been shown to be of great use for downstream NLP tasks ([Mikolov et al.  2013](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf); [Pennington et al.  2014](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162)). Many recently proposed approaches go beyond these pre-trained embeddings. Recent works have proposed methods that produce different representations for the same word depending on its contextual usage ([Peters et al.  2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1161) [2018a](https://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1202); [Akbik et al.  2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139); [Devlin et al.  2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)). These methods have shown to be very powerful in the fields of named entity recognition  coreference resolution  part-of-speech tagging and question answering  especially in combination with classic word embeddings.  Our paper is based on the work of [Riedl and Padó (2018)](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2020). They showed how to build a model for German named entity recognition (NER) that performs at the state of the art for both contemporary and historical texts. Labeled historical texts for German named entity recognition are a low-resource domain. In order to achieve robust state-of-the-art results for historical texts they used transfer-learning with labeled data from other high-resource domains like CoNLL-2003 ([Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder  2003](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419)) or GermEval ([Benikova et al.  2014](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/276_Paper.pdf)). They showed that using Bi-LSTM with a CRF as the top layer and word embeddings outperforms CRFs with hand-coded features in a big-data situation.  We build up upon their work and use the same low-resource datasets for Historic German. Furthermore  we show how to achieve new state-of-the-art results for Historic German named entity recognition by using only unlabeled data via pre-trained language models and word embeddings. We also introduce a novel language model pre-training objective  that uses only contemporary texts for training to achieve comparable state-of-the-art results on historical texts.

"""Accurately ranking the vast number of candidate detections is crucial for dense object detectors to achieve high performance. In this work  we propose to learn IoU-aware classification scores (**IACS**) that simultaneously represent the object presence confidence and localization accuracy  to produce a more accurate ranking of detections in dense object detectors. In particular  we design a new loss function  named **Varifocal Loss (VFL)**  for training a dense object detector to predict the IACS  and a new efficient star-shaped bounding box feature representation (the features at nine yellow sampling points) for estimating the IACS and refining coarse bounding boxes. Combining these two new components and a bounding box refinement branch  we build a new IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture  what we call **VarifocalNet** or **VFNet** for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO benchmark show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong baseline by ~2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best model VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN reaches a single-model single-scale AP of **55.1** on COCO `test-dev`  achieving the state-of-the-art performance among various object detectors.  <div align=""center"">   <img src=""VFNet.png"" width=""600px"" />   <p>Learning to Predict the IoU-aware Classification Score.</p> </div>   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/hyz-xmaster/VarifocalNet

"""Object Cut is an online image background removal service that uses [BASNet](https://github.com/NathanUA/BASNet). Removing the background from an image is a common operation in the daily work of professional photographers and image editors. This process is usually a repeatable and manual task that requires a lot of effort and human time. However  thanks to [BASNet](https://github.com/NathanUA/BASNet)  one of the most robust and fastest performance deep learning models in image segmentation  Object Cut was able to turn it into an easy and automatic process.   It was built as an API to make it as easy as possible to integrate. APIs  also known as Application Programming Interfaces  are already a common way to integrate different types of solutions to improve systems without actually knowing what is happening inside. Specifically  RESTful APIs are a standard in the Software Engineering field for designing and specifying APIs. Making it substantially easier to adapt your desired APIs to your workflows.  <br> <p align=""center"">   <img alt=""Pipeline"" src=""docs/images/pipeline.png"" width=""100%""/> </p> <br>  Object Cut was born to power up the designing and image editing process from the people who work with images daily.

"""TabNet should **not act as a replacement to boosted methods** for typical data science use-cases. However  it may provide improved performance in use-cases where the labelled dataset is large (e.g.  millions of examples)  or in situations where only an unsupervised model is needed (e.g.  fraud detection).  - **Performance:** While the paper demonstrates promising results  my TabNet implemention underperformed XGBoost in `adult_census` and only slightly outperformed XGBoost in `forest_census` (likely driven by the larger size of the dataset). These results are produced without hyperparamater tuning. - **Training time:** The training time for TabNet models is considerably higher than the XGBoost counterpart on CPU  though this difference is lower on GPU. As such  TabNet should only be considered when plenty of samples are available (e.g.  as with `Forest Cover`) - **Interpretability:** Aside from (i) visualising the embedding space of categorical features  and (ii) providing some intuition on which features the model was attending to while predicting on a text example  the vanilla TabNet model does not provide much additional interpretability over the importance plots already available in XGBoost.

The proposed method stimulated by [Bayesian GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09558) explores the full posteriors of Bayesian cyclic model (with latent sampling) and optimizes the model with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. By exploring the full posteriors over model parameters  the Bayesian marginalization could alleviate the risk of model collapse and boost multimodal distribution learning. Besides  we deploy a combination of L1 loss and GANLoss between reconstructed images and source images to enhance the reconstructed learning  we also prove that this variation has a global optimality theoretically and show its effectiveness in experiments.

"""The authors of this paper presents a novel approach in producing pixel-wise categorical segmentations using the very common encoder-decoder architecture. The concept of the encoder-decoder architecture (a.k.a. autoencoder) is such that the encoder block breaks down the input data by sequentially and repeatedly converting it into a higher-dimensional representation from the previous layer while trading-off size. At the end of the encoder  the highest-dimensional representation is then fed into the decoder  which performs the same process  except in reverse. The high-dimensional  small-sized output of the encoder is sequentially and repeatedly reduced to lower-dimensions and upscaled to the original input size  with a desired semantic form of output.   <p align='center'>   <img width=""800"" alt=""segnet architecture"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19466657/120553062-0df47e80-c3c6-11eb-9355-cd0f5d449752.png"">   <br/>   Image taken from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf.

The novelty in their approach stems from the issue that spatial information is always lost in an image-autoencoder network during downsampling in the encoder (via maxpooling). To mitigate that  they propose keeping the indices (i.e. pixel-coordinates) where maxpooling is done at each layer  so that spatial information can be restored locally during upsampling in the decoder.

"""Accurately ranking the vast number of candidate detections is crucial for dense object detectors to achieve high performance. In this work  we propose to learn IoU-aware classification scores (**IACS**) that simultaneously represent the object presence confidence and localization accuracy  to produce a more accurate ranking of detections in dense object detectors. In particular  we design a new loss function  named **Varifocal Loss (VFL)**  for training a dense object detector to predict the IACS  and a new efficient star-shaped bounding box feature representation (the features at nine yellow sampling points) for estimating the IACS and refining coarse bounding boxes. Combining these two new components and a bounding box refinement branch  we build a new IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture  what we call **VarifocalNet** or **VFNet** for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO benchmark show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong baseline by ~2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best model VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN reaches a single-model single-scale AP of **55.1** on COCO `test-dev`  achieving the state-of-the-art performance among various object detectors.  <div align=""center"">   <img src=""VFNet.png"" width=""600px"" />   <p>Learning to Predict the IoU-aware Classification Score.</p> </div>   """;General;https://github.com/hyz-xmaster/VarifocalNet

The former provides a link between all the useful information about the tracks (such as title  artist or year) and the audio track themselves  whereas the latter contains tags information on some of the tracks.

We will assume you have access to the actual songs in the dataset. Here is the outline of the approach we followed:  1. Extracte all the useful information from the Million Song Dataset and clean both the audio tracks and the Last.fm tags database to produce our final 'clean' data;  2. Prepare a flexible data input pipeline and transform the data in a format which is easy to consume by the training algorithm;  3. Prepare a flexible training script which would allow for multiple experiments (such as slightly different architectures  slightly different versions of the tags database  or different training parameters);  4. Train our model and use it to make sensible tag predictions from a given input audio.  In the following sections  we will provide a brief tutorial of how you may use this repository to make genre predictions of your own  or carry out some further experiments.

"""Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma  specifically  is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths  despite being the least common skin cancer. As with other cancers  early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.  Currently  dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient's moles to identify outlier lesions or “ugly ducklings” that are most likely to be melanoma. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account “contextual” images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. If successful  classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work.  Melanoma is a deadly disease  but if caught early  most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/ArivCR7/Melanoma_Classifier

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""The hyper-parameters are divided in 4 categories.    This pipeline's purpose is to train a neural network to segment NifTi files from examples.   Since the training requires example  the first step consists in producing manual segmentations of a fraction of the files. 10 to 50% of the files should be a good proportion  however this sample must be representative of the rest of the dataset. Datasets with great variability might require bigger fractions to be manually segmented.   The network is trained through a gradient back-propagation algorithm on the loss. The loss quantifies the difference between the predictions of the network and the manual segementations.   Once trained  the network can be used to automtically segment the entire dataset.  For training and inference  the volumes are sliced along the vertical axis and treated as collections of 2D images. Thus the image processing operations are 2D operations. Data augmentation is used on the training data.

"""That concludes this brief introduction into the wonderful world of Reinforcement Learning. Hopefully this provides you with a good foundation of understanding of the topic and can help springboard you into starting RL projects of your own. <br><br> Addtionally  it is important to note that RL is extremely expensive computationally. To train the Atari games  for example  even with a high end GPU  it could take multiple days of constant training. That being said  more simple environments can be trained is as little as 30 minutes to 1 hour.  <br> <br> Also important to note is that RL models are highly unstable and unpredictable. Even using the same seed for random number generation  the results of training may vary wildly from one training session to another. While it may have only taken 500 games to train the first time  the second time it might take 1000 games to reach the same performance. <br><br> There are also many hyperparameters to adjust  from the epsilon values to the layers of the neural network to the size of the batch in experience replay. Finding the right balance of these variables can be time-consuming  adding to the time sink that RL has the possibility to become. <br><br> That being said  it is extremely fulfilling when you see that your AI has actually started to learn and you see scores start climbing. <br><br> Beware  you may just find yourself become emotional involved in the success of your model.   You may have heard that the two types of learning are supervised and unsupervised - either you are training a model to correctly assign labels or training a model to group similar items together.

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

"""Due to the speed limitation of 20 FPS  we started with [YOLOv2-Tiny detector](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/)  which consists of a backbone network for feature extraction and a detection network for candidate bounding box generation. Considering that there is no need to classify in our task  we reduced the detection network to a location network  in which a candidate bounding box is only represented by a confidence socre and a position.  However  with such a simple model  we were soon faced with the challenges of tiny objects  occlusions and distractions from the provided data set. In order to tackle to the aforementioned challenges  we investigated various network architectures for both training and inference.   <p align=""center""> <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jndeng/DACSDC-DeepZ/master/Train/cfg/architecture.png"" alt=""network architecture"" width=""380px"" height=""400px""> </p>  We later combined [Feature Pyramid Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144v2) to fuse fine-grained features with strong semantic features to enhance the ability in detecting small objects. Meanwhile  we utilized [Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) function to mitigate the imbalance between the single ground truth box and the candidate boxes at training phase  thereby partially resolving occlusions and distractions. With the combined techniques  we achieved the inference network as shown in the figure with an accuracy improvement of ~ 0.042.   Moreover  we used multithreading to accelerate the process of prediction by loading images and infering in parallel  which improved about 7 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2.

"""In this project we are trying to build a system which can parse clinical discharge notes and generate information about clinical events along with temporal information about their occurrence. In  phase 1 of the project we establish a foundation for that by treating clinical events and temporal information as individual clinical entities and extracting those by performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using fine-tuned NCBI BERT model. In phase 2 of the project  we take inspiration from the paper KG-BERT to train a model using the word embedding representations generated from phase-1 fine-tuned model. We observe that the model do not perform well on test data. Thus we analyze the nature of the relationships and the model behavior to find out possible reasons of the poor performance.  Then we decide to fine-tune NCBI BERT for relation extraction task. For that we format the input in a specific way so that the model can perform sequence classification successfully using Transformer's attention patterns and BERT special tokens. We evaluate the model on test data and see significant improvement. We dockerise the solution along with the Flask application developed in phase-1 used to visualise the tagged data.   Though the fine-tuned NCBI-BERT model perform well on test data  there exists a major challenge related to usability of the model. So far the model is tested on relevant entity pairs for which TLINKs are available. The way of finding such relevant entity pairs from the available set of entities is yet to be found.  Another area with scope of improvement is to augment data using the nature of relationships to improve the model behavior. For example  if event A is known to happen before patient admission  it means it also occurs before all other events which occurred after admission. Also the input to BERT while fine-tuning can be improved. Our experiment can be treated as a baseline for future research and development in this area.

"""**BERT**  or **B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers  is a new method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  Our academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).  To give a few numbers  here are the results on the [SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) question answering task:  SQuAD v1.1 Leaderboard (Oct 8th 2018) | Test EM  | Test F1 ------------------------------------- | :------: | :------: 1st Place Ensemble - BERT             | **87.4** | **93.2** 2nd Place Ensemble - nlnet            | 86.0     | 91.7 1st Place Single Model - BERT         | **85.1** | **91.8** 2nd Place Single Model - nlnet        | 83.5     | 90.1  And several natural language inference tasks:  System                  | MultiNLI | Question NLI | SWAG ----------------------- | :------: | :----------: | :------: BERT                    | **86.7** | **91.1**     | **86.3** OpenAI GPT (Prev.

"""Input image (608  608  3)  The input image goes through a CNN  resulting in a (19  19  5  85) dimensional output.  After flattening the last two dimensions  the output is a volume of shape (19  19  425). Each cell in a 19 x 19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers: 425 = 5 x 85 because each cell contains predictions for 5 boxes  corresponding to 5 anchor boxes; 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because (pc  bx  by  bh  bw) has 5 numbers  and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect.  We then select only a few boxes based on score-thresholding--discarding boxes that have detected a class with a score less than the threshold  and non-max suppression - computing the Intersection over Union (IOU) and avoiding selecting overlapping boxes.

"""The user draws an image using given colors. Each of these colors represents a ""segment"" or type of object being present at that pixel. When they are satisfied with their sketch  they can click a button and the image will be uploaded into the backend of our program hosted on the Google Cloud. The program converts the image to a more readable form and passes it into a folder where we use NVIDIA's pre-trained models to create a synthesized image using learned traits about each texture and object and the pixel map the user submitted. This image is then displayed on the website for the user to see.   ...  One thing our program does not do is generate an instance map. The instance map segments the image into different instances of objects - and makes sure that if two of the same object are overlapping each other  they have different pixel values. Detecting and working past overlapping images is a hard problem for computer vision  and this helps generate higher fidelity images. However  we thought that the end user would not enjoy having to sketch another image  and would probably not be submitting very complex drawing with many overlapping figures  so we omitted using this in the model.

However  the decoder has no knowledge of whether or how well the vector being attended and the attention question being given are related  which may result in the decoder providing erroneous results.  Image captioning  that is to say generating natural automatic descriptions of language images are useful for visually impaired images and for the quest of natural language related pictures.  It is significantly more demanding than traditional vision tasks recognition of objects and classification of images for two guidelines.  First  well formed structured output space natural language sentences are considerably more challenging than just a set of class labels to predict.  Secondly  this dynamic output space enables a more thin understanding of the visual scenario  and therefore also a more informative one visual scene analysis to do well on this task.

"""In a very general way  recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch  text to read  products to buy or anything else depending on industries).  **There are two main data selection methods:**  Collaborative-filtering: In collaborative-filtering items are recommended  for example hotels  based on how similar your user profile is to other users’  finds the users that are most similar to you and then recommends items that they have shown a preference for. This method suffers from the so-called cold-start problem: If there is a new hotel  no-one else would’ve yet liked or watched it  so you’re not going to have this in your list of recommended hotels  even if you’d love it.  Content-based filtering: This method uses attributes of the content to recommend similar content. It doesn’t have a cold-start problem because it works through attributes or tags of the content  such as views  Wi-Fi or room types  so that new hotels can be recommended right away.  The point of content-based is that we have to know the content of both user and item. Usually you construct user-profile and item-profile using the content of shared attribute space. For example  for a movie  you represent it with the movie stars in it and the genres (using a binary coding for example).  **There are a number of popular encoding schemes but the main ones are:**   - One-hot encoding - Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding - Word embeddings  In this project  we will be discussing content-based filtering of recommender engine  turning implicit attributes into explicit features for hotel recommender engine.

"""Our project will process videos that contain human faces and return video with all facial features removed  either by performing a blur with randomized parameters  or by omitting facial pixels all together. We will likely do this by training a convolution neural network with a dataset used for video facial recognition  such as ‘Youtube Faces with Facial Keypoints’ found here.   Existing video editing software has blurring functionality  but the user often has to select the features  and it’s unclear whether deblurring could reveal the identity after-the-fact. There are a few papers and similar projects available online that have demonstrated such work  such as this research paper  the following two articles  and the work of Terrance Boult and Walter Schierer.  If time and project complexity allow  an additional portion of the project could be examining feasibility of an on-device-algorithm that could be used on a camera so there was no back-door to deanonymize the data.

Cityscapes dataset has 2975 images and mask of green cover of different cities around the world which was used as the training data and 500 image with masks were used as testing dataset. The images were google street view images. The DCNN model has an IOU of 61.2 percent. In this approach I used state of the art unet model and mobile net v2 model. Unet gave an IOU of 74.5 percent and mobile net v2 model gave an IOU of 64.3 percent which were better and lighter model than previously used DCNN model.

In this paper  we present a lightweight network to address this problem  namely **LEDNet**  which employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture for the task of real-time semantic segmentation.More specifically  the encoder adopts a ResNet as backbone network  where two new operations  channel split and shuffle  are utilized in each residual block to greatly reduce computation cost while maintaining higher segmentation accuracy. On the other hand  an attention pyramid network (APN) is employed in the decoder to further lighten the entire network complexity. Our model has less than 1M parameters  and is able to run at over 71 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti GPU card. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off on Cityscapes dataset. and becomes an effective method for real-time semantic segmentation tasks.

"""Manufacturing is becoming automated on a broad scale. The technology enables manufacturers to affordably boost their throughput  improve quality and become nimbler as they respond to customer demands. Automation is a revolution in manufacturing quality control. It allows the companies to set certain bars or criteria for the products being manufactured. Then it also aids in real-time tracking of the manufacturing process through machine vision cameras and/or recordings.   The core deliverable for this project is building deep learning image classification models which can automate the process of inspection for casting defects. I have produced a rest endpoint which can accept a cast image and subsequently run a tuned model to classify if the cast is acceptable or not.    As part of this project  I have built the computer vision models in 3 different ways addressing different personas  because not all companies will have a resolute data science team.   1.	Using Keras Tensorflow model (convolution2d) what a trained team of data scientists would do. 2.	Using Azure Machine Learning Designer (designer) which enables AI engineers and Data scientists use a drag and drop prebuilt model DenseNet (densenet).  3.

Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.

"""This notebook focuses on the so-called Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) introduced by  Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)].  The ULMFiT model consists of three main stages in the building a language model (LM):  1. **General-domain LM  pre-training**: Similar to the ImageNet database used in computer vision   the idea is to pre-train a large corpus of text. The ULMFiT has a pre-trained model called the  `Wikitext-103` where more than 20 000 Wikipedia articles was trained on.  This is alreadly included in the `fastai.text` API  thus  it is not necessary to carry out this step.  2. **LM fine-tuning**: Because the target data (typically) comes from a different  distribution from the general-domain  it is necessary to fine-tune the LM to adapt to  the idosyncrasies of the target data. Howard and Ruder suggested *discriminative fine-tuning* and *slanted triangular learning rates* for fine-tuning the LM. These techniques are available  in `fastai` and are described in [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146)].  3. **Classifier fine-tuning**: Using the updated weights from the previous step  a classifier can be fine-tuned. Howard and Ruder suggested a few techniques which include *concat pooling*  and *gradual unfreezing*. The latter in particular is used in this demonstration.  Again  the `fastai` framework allows one to perform this technique.  **Reference**  [1] J. Howard and S. Ruder. 2018.*Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification*.

On the other hand  an attention pyramid network (APN) is employed in the decoder to further lighten the entire network complexity. Our model has less than 1M parameters  and is able to run at over 71 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti GPU card.

"""Presented here is a project involving an implementation of a neural network architecture that has the aim of detecting rooftops in a typical 'object detection' task. But why is it called Zeus? For two main reasons; firstly Zeus is the god of the sky and we are detecting rooftops from aerial drone photographs. Secondly  because Zeus was the first god to inhabit Olympus and birth the future gods. This project was my first ambitious AI-related project and I hope like Zeus it will spawn many others that follow in its footsteps. I'm not going to dwell too long on the background  theory  or exact nature of neural networks. Many articles and resources are available for this and my attempt at rehashing this history would not do it justice. Instead  I will focus on the problems I faced with this project and how I overcame them. I find the most useful resources online (especially while attempting this project) were those that focussed on the implementation rather than getting caught up in theory. I will walk through the project and code in chronological order which also closely follows the order of implementation of each component.  A brief explainer on the origins of this project: originally it was a code test sent by a company  but I felt that I needed to finish it. As I progressed through the project I continued to learn about how exactly to implement a neural network and obtain results from working code. This was very valuable to me  as while I have education in neural network theory  the practical nature of actual implementation I feel is something you can only get from experience. As for the tools I chose  Mask-RCNN is a commonly used and well understood network that performs well in object detection tasks. Therefore  I decided to use Mask-RCNN as it had pre-trained weights available and would have lots of documentation (for specific resources used  see references). Faster R-CNN was also considered  but Mask R-CNN also has the option of outputting masks for each object (i.e. performing object segmentation as well as detection).

"""Sampling from a latent space of images to produce entirely new images is currently one of the most prominent and successful application of creative artificial intelligence. In this context  generative adversarial networks (or GANs for short) (Goodfellow et al.  2014)  first introduced in 2014  have exploded in popularity as an alternative to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for learning latent spaces of images. They have been used in real-life applications for text/image/video generation  drug discovery and text-toimage synthesis.  GANs are a kind of generative model that allows us to generate a whole image in parallel  in contrast with recurrent networks where the model generates the image one pixel at a time. Along with several other kinds of generative models  GANs use a differentiable function represented by a neural network as a generator G network. The generator network takes random noise as input  then runs that noise through a differentiable function to transform the noise and reshape it to have recognizable structure. The output of the generator is a realistic image. The choice of the random input noise determines which image will come out of the generator network. Running the generator with many different input noise values produces many different realistic output images.  The goal is for these images to be as fair samples from the distribution over real data. Of course  the generator net doesn’t start out producing realistic images. It has to be trained. The training process for a generative model is very different from the training process for a supervised learning model. For a supervised learning model  we show the model an image of an object and we tell it  this is the label. For a generative model  there is no output to associate with each image. We just show the model a lot of images and ask it to make more images that come from the same probability distribution.  ##  <figure>   <img src=""fig1.png"">   <figcaption>Scheme representing the general structure of a GAN  using MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector the generator uses to construct its fake images. As the generator learns through training  it figures out how to map these random vectors to recognizable images that can fool the discriminator. The output of the discriminator is a sigmoid function  where 0 indicates a fake image and 1 indicates a real image.   </figcaption> </figure>  ##  But how we actually get the model to do that? Most generative models are trained by adjusting the parameters to maximize the probability that the generator net will generate the training data set. Unfortunately for a lot of interesting models  it can be very difficult to compute this probability. Most generative models get around that with some kind of approximation. GANs use an approximation where a second network  called the discriminator D  learns to guide the generator. The discriminator is just a regular neural net classifier. During the training process  the discriminator is shown real images from the training data half the time and fake images from the generator the other half of the time. The discriminator is trained to output the probability that the input is real. So it tries to assign a probability near 1 to real images  and a probability near zero to fake images (see Fig. 1). Meanwhile  the generator tries to do the opposite. It is trained to try to output images that the discriminator will assign probability near one of being real. Over time  the generator is forced to produce more realistic output in order to fool the discriminator. The generator takes random noise values z and maps them to output values x. Wherever the generator maps more values of z  the probability distribution over x  represented by the model  becomes denser. The discriminator outputs high values wherever the density of real data is greater than the density of generated data. The generator changes the samples it produces to move uphill along the function learned by the discriminator (see Algorithm 1). In other words  the generator moves its samples into areas where the model distribution is not yet dense enough. Eventually  the generator’s distribution matches the real distribution  and the discriminator has to output a probability of one half everywhere because every point is equally likely to be generated by the real data set as to be generated by the model. The two densities are equal.   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/vmartinezalvarez/Image-generation-GAN-vs-DCGAN

"""This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)  which is going to appear in CVPR 2017. We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.  In this repository  we release code and data for training a PointNet classification network on point clouds sampled from 3D shapes  as well as for training a part segmentation network on ShapeNet Part dataset.

At the representation learning stage of FFB6D  we build **bidirectional** fusion modules in the **full flow** of the two networks  where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. In this way  the two networks can leverage local and global complementary information from the other one to obtain better representations. Moreover  at the output representation stage  we designed a simple but effective 3D keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects  which simplifies keypoint localization for precise pose estimation.

"""**RepPoints**  initially described in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11490)  is a new representation method for visual objects  on which visual understanding tasks are typically centered. Visual object representation  aiming at both geometric description and appearance feature extraction  is conventionally achieved by `bounding box + RoIPool (RoIAlign)`. The bounding box representation is convenient to use; however  it provides only a rectangular localization of objects that lacks geometric precision and may consequently degrade feature quality. Our new representation  RepPoints  models objects by a `point set` instead of a `bounding box`  which learns to adaptively position themselves over an object in a manner that circumscribes the object’s `spatial extent` and enables `semantically aligned feature extraction`. This richer and more flexible representation maintains the convenience of bounding boxes while facilitating various visual understanding applications. This repo demonstrated the effectiveness of RepPoints for COCO object detection.  Another feature of this repo is the demonstration of an `anchor-free detector`  which can be as effective as state-of-the-art anchor-based detection methods. The anchor-free detector can utilize either `bounding box` or `RepPoints` as the basic object representation.  <div align=""center"">   <img src=""demo/reppoints.png"" width=""400px"" />   <p>Learning RepPoints in Object Detection.</p> </div>   """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/nuannuanhcc/ps_reppoint

"""We implement both the Nueral ODE and ResNet architectures for classification of electrocardiogram signals. The data is taken from the frequently used MIT-BIH ECG database  which contains over 100 000 labeled samples of ECG signals from a single heartbeat. The data and a description of the sampling procedure used can be found at https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/. We briefly visualize the data  which enables us an intuitive look at the various features and differences between each class that our neural networks will learn and distinguish.   We construct both network architectures with the help of PyTorch and the torchdiffeq library found in the original Neural ODE paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366. The ResNet and ODENet  the implementation of the Neural ODE  are designed to be as similar as possible  so we can compare the two fairly. Both models contain identical downampling layers  1D convolutions  normalizations (Group)  activations (ReLU)  and output layers. We train both models and evaluate them on the testing set while also noting differences in speed  memory  and accuracy. Overall  both models perform comparably on the testing data. However  there is a tradeoff between speed and memory. The ResNet is faster to train while the ODENet contains fewer tunable parameters (less memory).

Recent one-shot approaches have shown promising results that are able to run in real-time. One-shot models learn detections and appearance embeddings jointly. We built upon the one-shot method by changing the way the embeddings are trained. Softmax based features are trained by classifying the embedding feature map to the correspond track-IDs. We propose a pairwise loss that is able to learn embeddings without track-ID labels. On the MOT17 dataset we obtain competitive results with respect to the softmax based method.

It is a great improvement upon the [original GAN network](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) that was first introduced by Ian Goodfellow at NIPS 2014. (DCGANs are much more stable than Vanilla GANs) DCGAN uses the same framework of generator and discriminator. This is analogous to solving a two player minimax game: Ideally the goal of the discriminator is to be very sharp in distinguishing between the real and fake data  whereas  generator aims at faking data in such a way that it becomes nearly impossible for the discriminator to classify it as a fake.

"""This is a classifier to predict label of hand drawn doodle images in real time. The idea is based on [QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#) by Google. The [dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) they provide contains 50 million images across 345 categories! I am using a subset of 50 categories for my model because of limited resources but one can use the same code with small tweaks to train on all 345 categories.  I built and trained the model in Pytorch and converted it to onnx format to use it in the browser. Initially my plan was to perform the classification on the backend. After drawing  the user would press a button and the request would be sent to the server for classification. That is how I built the app. However  it was very expensive on the server because for every image there would a request. Hence I decided to move the classification on the frontend. Also it is a lot more fun to see the model try to classify the image in real time :grin:.  It took me a very long time to train and tweak the model to obtain a good accuracy particularly because the dataset was huge even though I was using only a subset of it and training the model on the GPU. How someone draws a certain object varies a lot. It is all based on imagination and perception of that person about that object. Hence it was necessary to use lots of images per category to capture maximum variations.   For the record  88% was the average test accuracy(averaged out across the classes). Had it been allowed to train for longer  I believe it could have crossed 90% mark but I had already spent days on training it so I let it go. Yes days! Colab has a limit on the usage of GPUs after which the runtime gets disconnected. So I had to train the model for some hours every day for about 2-3 days to get good accuracy. Then I would make tweaks to the model and restart the process.     """;Computer Vision;https://github.com/deeplearning987/DoodleClassifier

The CBQA application allows the user to add context and perform Question Answering(QA) in that context.  The main components in this application use [Haystack's](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) core components   > - **FileConverter**: Extracts pure text from files (pdf  docx  pptx  html and many more). > -  **PreProcessor**: Cleans and splits texts into smaller chunks. > -   **DocumentStore**: Database storing the documents  metadata and vectors for our search. We recommend Elasticsearch or FAISS  but have also more light-weight options for fast prototyping (SQL or In-Memory). >   - **Retriever**: Fast algorithms that identify candidate documents for a given query from a large collection of documents. Retrievers narrow down the search space significantly and are therefore key for scalable QA. Haystack supports sparse methods (TF-IDF  BM25  custom Elasticsearch queries) and state of the art dense methods (e.g. sentence-transformers and Dense Passage Retrieval) > - **Reader**: Neural network (e.g. BERT or RoBERTA) that reads through texts in detail to find an answer. The Reader takes multiple passages of text as input and returns top-n answers. Models are trained via  [FARM](https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM)  or [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)  on SQuAD like tasks. You can just load a pretrained model from  [Hugging Face's model hub](https://huggingface.co/models)  or fine-tune it on your own domain data. > >Source: [Haystack's Key Components docs](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/#key-components)  In CBQA the allowed formats for adding the context are    - Textual Context (Using the TextBox field)  - File Uploads (.pdf  .txt  and .docx)  These contexts are uploaded to a temporary directory for each user for pre-processing and deletes after uploading them to **Elasticsearch ** which is the only **DocumentStore type** used in this system.  Each user has a separate Elasticsearch index to store the context documents. Using the **PreProcessor** and the **FileConverter** modules from [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)  the pre-processing and the extraction of text from context files is done.  **Elasticsearcher Retriever** is used in CBQA to retrieve relevant documents based on the search query.  **Transformers-based Readers** are used to extracting answers from the retrieved documents.

"""Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular method for training neural networks  using “minibatches” of data to update the network’s weights.  Improvements are often made upon SGD by either using acceleration/momentum or by altering the learning rate over time. Zhang et al. propose a novel improvement in [LookaheadOptimizer: k steps forward  1 step back](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08610). They showed that Lookahead consistantly outperformed other optimizers on popular language modelling  machine translantion and image classification tasks.   Lookahead uses a set of fast weights which lookahead k steps and a set of slow weights with learning rate alpha. From a high-level perspective  Lookahead chooses the search direction by calculating the fast weights of the inner optimizer. The approach facilitates the use of any inner optimizer such as Adam or SGD. This comes with the cost of a slighlty increased time complexity  however the original authors illustrate a significant increase in efficiency.   This project aims to test these findings by reimplementing the main CIFAR-10/100 and Penn Treebank experiments.

"""Recently  channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs). However  most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off  this paper proposes an EfficientChannel Attention (ECA) module  which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channelattention module in SENet  we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention  and appropriatecross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore  we propose a localcross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction  which can be efficiently implemented via `1D` convolution. Furthermore we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of `1D` convolution  determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. Theproposed ECA module is efficient yet effective  e.g.  the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs.24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFLOPs vs. 3.86 GFLOPs  respectively  and the performance boost is more than 2\% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensivelyevaluate our ECA module on image classification  object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of ResNets and MobileNetV2. Theexperimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts.   """;General;https://github.com/BangguWu/ECANet

"""Super-resolution (SR) of images refers to the process of generating or reconstructing the high- resolution (HR) images from low-resolution images (LR). This project mainly focuses on dealing with this problem of super-resolution using the generative adversarial network  named SRGAN  a deep learning framework. In this project  SRGAN was trained and evaluated using 'DIV2K'  ‘MS-COCO’ and ‘VID4’ [6] which are the popular datasets for image resolution tasks.  In total  datasets were merged to form:   1. 5800 training images  2. 100 validation images  3. 4 videos for testing  Apart from the datasets mentioned above  ‘LFW’  ‘Set5’ and ‘Set14’ datasets [6] were used to get inferences and compare the performance of models implemented in this project with the models from Ledig et al. [2].  Most of this project is built upon the ideas of Ledig et al [2]. Apart from that  I did some research on comparing the results obtained using different objective functions available in TensorFlow’s “TFGAN” library for loss optimizations of SRGAN. Different model implementations were evaluated for pixel quality through the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores as a metric. Intuitively  this metric does not capture the essence of the perceptual quality of an image. However  it is comparatively easy to use PSNR when evaluating the performance while training the model compared to mean-opinion-score (MOS) that has been used by Ledig et al [2]. To evaluate the perceptual quality of images  I have compared the generated images from both the models. This paper also proposes a method of super-resolution using SRGAN with “Per-Pix loss” which I defined in the losses section of this paper. Based on results from [2] and [5]  I have combined both MSE and VGG losses  named it “Per-Pix loss” that stands for ‘Perceptual and Pixel’ qualities of the image  which resulted in preserving the pixel quality besides improving the perceptual quality of images. Finally  I have compared the models built in this project with the models from Ledig et al. [2] to know the performance and effectiveness of models implemented in this project.

Instead of using fully-connected layers with reduction ratio bottleneck as in the case of SENets  ECANet uses an adaptive shared (across channels) 1D convolution kernel on the downsampled GAP *C* x 1 x 1 tensor. ECA is an equivalently plug and play module similar to SE attention mechanism and can be added anywhere in the blocks of a deep convolutional neural networks. Because of the shared 1D kernel  the parameter overhead and FLOPs cost added by ECA is significantly lower than that of SENets while achieving similar or superior performance owing to it's capabilities of constructing adaptive kernels.

We proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). You can also check our [project webpage](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet) for a deeper introduction.  Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format  most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This  however  renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper  we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds  which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.  Our network  named PointNet  provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification  part segmentation  to scene semantic parsing. Though simple  PointNet is highly efficient and effective.

No internet connection is required  everything is done locally on the edge device itself. Further  multiple edge devices can create a distributed AIoT network.  At DT42  we believe that bringing deep learning to edge devices is the trend towards the future. It not only saves costs of data transmission and storage but also makes devices able to respond according to the events shown in the images or videos without connecting to the cloud.  ![Figure 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/292790/45943626-a3d28b80-c019-11e8-829c-5eb6afd3faa4.png)  <p align=""center"">Figure 1: BerryNet architecture</p>  Figure 1 shows the software architecture of the project  we use Node.js/Python  MQTT and an AI engine to analyze images or video frames with deep learning.

"""One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classification and localization (i.e.  bounding box regression). The classification is usually optimized by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an \emph{individual} prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization  where the predicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection performance. This paper delves into the \emph{representations} of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation  classification and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices  including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classification between training and inference (i.e.  separately trained but compositely used in test) and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when there is ambiguity and uncertainty which is often the case in complex scenes. To address the problems  we design new representations for these elements. Specifically  we merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint representation of localization quality and classification  and use a vector to represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible distribution in real data  but contain \emph{continuous} labels  which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the \emph{continuous} version for successful optimization. On COCO {\tt test-dev}  GFL achieves 45.0\% AP using ResNet-101 backbone  surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5\%) and ATSS (43.6\%) with higher or comparable inference speed  under the same backbone and training settings. Notably  our best model can achieve a single-model single-scale AP of 48.2\%  at 10 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU.  <img src=""https://github.com/implus/GFocal/blob/master/gfocal.png"" width=""1000"" height=""300"" align=""middle""/>  For details see [GFocal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04388.pdf).

"""**BERT**  or **B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers  is a new method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  Our academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a number of tasks can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).  To give a few numbers  here are the results on the [SQuAD v1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) question answering task:  SQuAD v1.1 Leaderboard (Oct 8th 2018) | Test EM  | Test F1 ------------------------------------- | :------: | :------: 1st Place Ensemble - BERT             | **87.4** | **93.2** 2nd Place Ensemble - nlnet            | 86.0     | 91.7 1st Place Single Model - BERT         | **85.1** | **91.8** 2nd Place Single Model - nlnet        | 83.5     | 90.1  And several natural language inference tasks:  System                  | MultiNLI | Question NLI | SWAG ----------------------- | :------: | :----------: | :------: BERT                    | **86.7** | **91.1**     | **86.3** OpenAI GPT (Prev.

"""Environments where the extrinsic rewards are sparsely observed are harder to explore and to learn for RL agents since they may require more episodes to determine which sequences of actions lead to high rewards. Recently  it has been argued that adding intrinsic rewards (for instance through Random Network Distillation) can help to drive the exploration efficiently in Atari games [1][2][3] and can be simply implemented along with Proximal Policy Optimization [4]. As opposed to extrinsic rewards  intrinsic rewards are not necessarily constant over the episodes: such rewards can be seen as ""curiosity"" functions. Through this case study we aim at highlighting the advantages and limitations of curiosity-driven exploration.

"""Today's deep learning models need to be trained on large-scale surveillance data sets. This means that for each data  there will be a corresponding label. In the popular ImageNet dataset  there are one million images with manual annotations  that is  1000 of each of the 1000 categories. Creating such a data set requires a lot of effort  and it may take a lot of people to spend months working on it. Assuming that you now have to create a data set of one million classes  you must label each frame in a total of 100 million frames of video data  which is basically impossible.  Ideally  we want to have a model that runs more like our brain. It requires only a few tags to understand many things in the real world. In the real world  I refer to classes that are object categories  action categories  environment categories  categories of objects  and many more.
